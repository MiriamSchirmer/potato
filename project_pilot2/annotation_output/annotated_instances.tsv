5ec6d06c67b0da0fb6f85e83	6_ptsd	"Iv had ptsd for 10 Years, I was never told what to expect or what a flash back is.  A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.   The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.   My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn’t stand with out pain. 
For the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back.  I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.    I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I’d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.   I felt numb and anxious I’d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn’t go in I’d feel guilty for not going in.  But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn’t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.   I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone. 
Because I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol.  Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.   When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd.  I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time

Iv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can’t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.   Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them.  I don’t really talk in therapy session and the reply’s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.   My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school

There’s an emotion I feel when I’m in a state sometimes, it’s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced."

5ec6d06c67b0da0fb6f85e83	0_ptsd	"I (23m) experienced my father (55m) having a seizure and hitting the floor, and now I am experiencing extreme moodswings.  Can I prevent these things? (more in post) I'll try to keep this short and simple as possible.  But my father had a seizure about 2 and a half weeks ago.  I was not there in the same room when it happened, but I knew SOMETHING was wrong when i heard the ictal cry (Google if you are not aware of what this is, but it's pretty much a loud groan, all of the air escaping through the larynx as the seizure starts.  I heard the ictal cry and turned the corner and saw my father, stiff, falling to the ground from a standing position, and watched him hit his head, as he was already half of the way down when I saw him.    


It was only me, my sister, and father home at the time.  I of course helped him in the moment during the seizure, keeping him on his side, calling 911, etc.  He is doing alright now (this was his first tonic seizure, not a diagnosed epileptic as of yet) But, weeks after, i cannot stop thinking about this, especially late at night.    


i get up and our of my room every time i hear ANYTHING loud from in the house, since it is typically only me and my father home, while my mother works.  I am CONSTANTLY checking up on him, worried that i will walk into another seizure in the moment.  I have a grave feeling in my stomach every time i leave my room to check on him.    


Also, a days ago, I woke up and strictly remember having a dream about the seizure experience, like a replay of that day.  And that day, i have never been so sad/angry (i think i suppressed my sadness and ended up getting very irate) which is super abnormal for me.  Punching my desk getting mad at games when I never do.  Getting mad at friends for saying silly things (I attacked my friend for buying another iphone and supporting apple)   


I don't have a license, and I have to get one now, since my father cannot drive for 6 months.  This is giving me a ton of anxiety, especially since I am being forced in a way."

5ec6d06c67b0da0fb6f85e83	20_ptsd	"And then with my friend who I think abused me, I guess I did see the red flags and (for whatever reason) chose to ignore them, because I thought I could control/handle it.  Same with the abusive ex coming to think of it.  So maybe it's that I don't avoid these situations enough?? (Could my trauma have desensitised me to certain warning signs?)

&amp;#x200B;

But then part of me also thinks, is it about how I'm interpreting situations?

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 17 I went through a highly traumatic series of events, and I was only able to recover by recognising and understanding abuse.  I'd experienced things like gaslighting, I became aware of common misconceptions people have - I guess I had to learn about abuse / healthy relationships on a logical level, before going on to experience them, because my trauma had been so bad and completely messed up the way I viewed relationships? So I had to reform my ideas step by step using logic/principles?

&amp;#x200B;

So there's two ways of looking at this - awareness and projection. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's definitely true that I see abuse where others don't.  Also I don't \*always\* mean it as such a seriously bad thing - I mean obviously it's unacceptable, does have a negative impact, and needs to be stopped.  But I don't think ""traumatic"" or ""super emotionally damaging"" are prerequisites (though they obviously often come with it) - I think it's just a significant violation of someone's boundaries in a way that doesn't have a reasonable explanation, accompanied by gaslighting or denial (though gaslighting doesn't need to be there when it's severe).  So say with my ex - I feel like the emotional manipulation was traumatic, but the specific individual instances of sexual abuse (and the gaslighting that came with those) wasn't traumatic and didn't need to be to ""count"" as abusive?

I can think of someone or a situation as ""abusive"" without thinking it defines them as a person, they'd act like that in all contexts, or that they were consciously meaning to do harm."
