If you think a text contains a traumatic event, click on \"trauma\" and then highlight the event in the text. You can also mark a text span with the \"uncertain\" option. If there is NO TRAUMATIC EVENT, MOVE FORWARD without selecting anything. For the best experience, please ensure your browser window is maximized to full screen.
