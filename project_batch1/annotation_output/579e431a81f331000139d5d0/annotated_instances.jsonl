I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. \n\nAt 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. \n\nThe doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said \"what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?\" I said I didn't know what was wrong. \n\nAfter they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. \n\nThey discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a \"nasty fever\" and told me to rest for a few days.\n\nAt 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. \n\nPositive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.\n\nBeing septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. \n\nI returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). \n\nNow I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well \"hey, she didn't have cancer\" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. \n\nI constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. \n\nThank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest.
