Neither are truths; only thoughts. Once we have fears like this though, we start to pull away from people, the fears keep us isolated, which makes the thoughts worse, and the cycle continues.\u00a0We all have a place in this world. We all have value, we all deserve love, and there are safe, wonderful people out there waiting to meet you and care for you.\u00a0Can you take a moment right now to become more in touch with three things? First, who in your life, if they were sitting beside you right now, would say \"wait a minute...I love you!\" What is the evidence that you are already cared about? Then ask yourself \"what is the evidence that I am lovable?\" What qualities do you have that make you a good friend or person? The third question is \"what tells you the world is a good place?\" What evidence do you see that there are people out there who care about others?\u00a0Please reach out to someone today as you ask yourself those questions.

When I was 13 I was walking at home from school and I saw someone on there knees begging for change. So I gave them my left over lunch money 5.73$ I counted it out before I gave it to them. When I walked away I looked back at the man to see someone else standing above him with a gun. The guy sitting offered what I gave him to the man but I heard him say it wasn't enough. I watched as the man with the gun pulled the trigger and the guy sitting fell limp to the ground. The man ran away and I sat down were I was and just looked even when the sitting man was taken away. I remember these things every night. I see it all happen over and over again. I don't tell my wife why I scream at night. I don't say why I can't be left alone. I have panic attacks from what I've seen and have happened to me. I am afraid and alone. I've never been able to speak to anyone about this and I never will. I see the bearings and the limp body even when I'm awake. I've tried to hang myself or jump off my roof to get rid of the images. Nothing helps. I'm afraid that nothing ever will."}, "902_counseling": {"id": "902_counseling", "text": "I'm in my late teens and live with my dad.  The only time I go out is for my college classes.
