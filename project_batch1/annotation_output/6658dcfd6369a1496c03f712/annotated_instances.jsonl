Tw Wanted to give a heads up that this deals with heavier situations/topics.please please be careful when reading!\n\n\nSo, when i was around the age of 13 I went to a mental hospital to help me with my suicidal thoughts and depression. The place was horrible and caused me a lot of trauma. The staff were abusive and gave me so much medication that on my 8th day of being there i only thought it was my 3rd day due to how out of it i was.\nSo, for the most part i barely remember everything that happened there but sometimes i get random flashbacks to moments I either blocked out or didn't remember due to the medication.\n\nOne I recently remembered happened around my last day there. The only reason I left was due to the fact that i had a melt down during visitations and my family forced me out of the hospital, by now I'm questioning if this was one of the things that caused my tipping point.\n\nI have bad psoriasis, it was especially bad back then. Covered 75-80% of my body, so i constantly had to use medicine. The staff would give me it after taking my pills and I'd go to a private room by myself to apply it.\nWell, near the last day a nurse didn't hand it to me but instead took it, brought me to a different room, took my shirt and pants off without warning, then started applying it to my body. She then went on to go underneath my underwear to apply it onto my backside.\n\nI was too confused and dazed to really do anything or tell her I was uncomfortable because the medication instantly hit me with drowsiness/fuzziness but i remember feeling humiliated and shocked by it.\n\nShe was a female nurse, kind of sweet but could be very rude at times. She often picked favorites as well. This memory just came out of the blue and i instantly felt so fucking disgusted and shocked because it didn't seem or feel right and I never remembered it until i was just randomly looking back on my experiences there. \n\nI'm questioning if it's okay for me to feel this way about it. I feel guilty because maybe she was just really use to taking care of little kids and got carried away? Is that behavior normal? No one else in the hospital did that to me from what i remember.  I'm scared to see a doctor and talk to them about my mental health and worries though because i don't wish to deal with that all over again, too much happened in such a short amount of time and yet i barely remember most of it.

Physically, demanding yes, but fun and rewarding. \n\nIt was a month and a half into my new job when I was attacked by a pit bull. The dog was special needs which usually means he was dog aggressive which he was. What this boils down to is that I took him out to play in the morning, and again in the afternoon.

I went through protocol to redirect his attention to me so that we could continue to play, but when none of that worked sp I squirted water onto his neck.\n\nAll that agression redirect to me, and he gave me no indication that he was going to attack so it surprised me when he jumped up going straight for my throat.

Everyone tells me how much EDMR helped lessen the severity of their PTSD but it doesn\u2019t work immediately, right? So after that first session when I\u2019ve just recalled everything I\u2019d be extremely at risk, right? But on the other hand if I keep avoiding this treatment then the PTSD will never stop.\n\nI don\u2019t have any friends or family nearby who can babysit me.

I can only trust hard data from actual test results which has already led to a statistically unwarranted biopsy that I needed to get or else I\u2019d lose my mind but who knew you had to be awake for biopsies?!

{"id": "205_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Experienced an abusive relationship and trying to understand why it is haunting me so severely I am looking for some advice really, as I feel very much at a dead end, and I'm really hoping that this can provide some answers - or at least lead me on to them. \n\n\n(I am adding this as an afterthought, but it occurs to me that some of this couldn't be triggering to some. Also, skit to the asterisk to skip several bleak accounts of some bad times and to the point of this post) \n\n To clarify, I am not diagnosed with ptsd and am by no means claiming to have the disorder. I exhibit many of the symptoms I have read about, but obviously that is by no means a diagnosis. I post this here, as reoccurring issues I have really been struggling with fall under the symptoms of ptsd, and ultimately, for lack of a better place to do so. If anyone knows of a more appropriate place I may voice my concerns to, feel free to correct me and I shall be on my way. \n\nRegardless, let me begin. \n\nI am fourteen (turning fifteen this month), and last year around this time I began a relationship. Although beginning deceptively normal, it quickly and suddenly spiralled into a cycle of abuse, crudely disguised as love. It began with my communication with her having to be constant, unfaltering; this was preferable to the threat of her becoming upset and ignoring or guilt tripping me - or really using any emotional manipulation tactic that you can think of. \n\nWithout me really being able to grasp what was happening, I had been fully isolated from my friends and family, and really, the whole world. She had dragged me into a delusional foli\u00e9 a deux, in which I constantly faced the threat of rejection, shame, dread, isolation and a whole selection of other rotten, empty feelings. \n\nIn addition to the emotional abuse, she coerced and manipulated me into engaging in sexual acts with her, despite me outlining specifically that I did not want to do so. \n\nSex became the only way for me to feel as if I was good enough for her, and bore some of the only moments at which she seemed happy and pleased with me. It was exhausting and bestowed on me deep, deep guilt, but if I were to refuse she would emotionally blackmail me and because deeply upset. \n\nShe escalated these sexual encounters to the point of extremity, forcing me to buy condoms when I was on the verge of tears. After these sexual encounters i would often cry, and grow increasingly dislodged from my own body, as it was my only coping mechanism to escape the abuse.  I did everything I could to avoid the same occurrence again; dropping change so we wouldn't have the \u00a32.90 for the condoms, refusing to leave the house if I knew that was her intent, fabricating lies about whatever I had to. \n\nI remember once, after telling her I didn't want to, the look on her face in a moment of brief lucidity which interrupted her brigade of plastic emotion, when she mentioned casually that if she got me to agree, then it would essentially be rape. \n\nThe further our relationship progressed, the more distant from reality I became, the further I grew from my family and the further my timid self retreated inwards, in hiding.\n\nMy travelling to France during the holidays exhibited some of the worst torment I had faced, despite not being in person. Her behaviour was amplified and she still had me almost completely under her illusion, although she was slowly losing her grip.\n\nShe would demand to have the passwords to all of my social media, and dig up conversations from months, years prior to dig up as evidence of cheating and disloyalty, only to ignore me for as long as she deemed appropriate and make me feel as guilty as she knew how to.\n\nWeeks before the end of our relationship, she joined me on a family caravaning holiday, which was, in hindsight, hell on earth. Her unrequited jealousy, especially towards my mother and sister, was uncontrollable and beyond reason, and her iron stare haunted the cosy metal box. I looked into her eyes and saw a deep, burning hatred, and became terrified of her. On a particular evening, when the rain was mercilessly beating down on the drooping tents, I was required to accompany her to the toilets, despite her ignoring me. Upon me attempting to talk to her, she quickly turned the corner and abandoned me at a swift, unforgiving place. I, of course, had no idea where on earth she was (she had a nasty habit of doing this) and in my delirious, desperate, confused state, my brain fabricated these tall, black figures who had taken her, as if to create a reason where it was not provided anything remotely attached to reality. Upon being found by my father, urgently pacing around looking for her, hysterical, she expressed no sympathy or concern, but simply offered an empty, dry sorry. \n\nThere are countless other situations I could site, but I think that these I have documented here serve the purpose of explanation well enough. \n\nIn august of last year is when it hits it peak and when I finally severed my ties with her. A barrage of insults following an exhausting, draining, empty argument was my breaking point, and in my desperation I reached out to my present family and family friends, who pointed out to me the reality of the situation. \n\nUpon reflection, it is clear to me that her actions were a result of her own past trauma, and I hold nothin against her. I have learned that holding anger in your heart does nothing but create more pain and sorrow. I also realise that I was so susceptible to her manipulation, as my mother struggled and is struggling with mental health issues, which lead to her being admitted into hospital for spells of time from when I was about 10-13. I knew she also had mental health issues, and subconsciously i believe I wanted desperately to make her happy because I never could make my mother happy, and felt as if it were my fault. \n\n*****I am posting here as, these events and feelings haunt me daily. They haunt my dreams, replay over and over in my head, bore their way into my skull like parasites, prevent me from ever just sitting alone with my thoughts, keep me disconnected from my feelings, sensations, my passions. I feel as if I am carrying around with me an immense guilt and sorrow. No matter how much I think I've made peace with my feelings, forgiven, and tried to move on, I have always been dragged back into this seemingly inescapable vortex of foggy, unclear, jumpy memories and an indescribable, constant feeling of dread and guilt. \n\nEvery time I see her name, hear mention of her, pass her in a corridor or even think of her, I receive an unpleasant jab of adrenaline, and my heart races uncontrollably. Any smells or objects that remind me of her provide the same painful jolt and can send me spiralling into despair. \n\nI am desperate, alone, but I still have so much life to me and I am scared to lose it. I want to set myself free. \n\n(sorry for any issues with coherency and te length. this seems to have provided a lot of therapeutic value, and that is most likely it's primary function. to expect someone to read this much of something so bleak is unreasonable)\n\nIf somehow, you read this far, thank I thank you greatly for briefly indulging in my troubled thoughts, and I wish you the best. \n\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 34, "span": "Experienced an abusive relationshi", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 34, "end": 35, "span": "p", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1784, "end": 1890, "span": "In addition to the emotional abuse, she coerced and manipulated me into engaging in sexual acts with her, ", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 4243, "end": 4648, "span": ".

I believe it has turned into an addiction, with me forgoing food and rent in lieu of buying weed (I don\u2019t have a lot of money so I can\u2019t afford this). I think it did help, but has turned into something uncontrollable at this point. I know I can manage my traumas without weed and with healthy coping skills. Today I\u2019m feeling the weight of anger towards people who have hurt me, who have taken away my basic rights as a human being to my own thoughts and feelings. I realized just now fully that when high, it distracts me and I don\u2019t think about all that stuff.\n\nI\u2019m still trying to rebuild my identity. I feel very very very small. I also don\u2019t eat a lot because of stress and have at times gotten to under 100 pounds, which makes me feel so small and weak and powerless in this world. Completely vulnerable. I feel like certain people have taken advantage of me, and shoved me deeper and deeper into the ground, abusively controlling and judging me when no one has any right to make another person feel like this; like everything that I think, do, like, don\u2019t do, don\u2019t like is wrong. I lived with someone who corrected everything I did, gaslighted me, etc. There are a handful of people I got away from but never got the chance to really stand up for myself.\n\nSo now I\u2019m looking at this life I have, no money, no car, no place of my own, underemployed\u2026and I just think\u2026it\u2019s been years of being a doormat and look where it\u2019s gotten me. I\u2019m a people pleaser and never make a fuss with people, I\u2019ve become mute in a lot of situations. I\u2019ve been admitted to the behavioral health clinic several times against my will even though I was not violent and I\u2019m literally just a tiny girl. I\u2019ve been condescended to in those places, belittled, threatened, etc.\n\nAll of this is coming up and I feel frustrated. I don\u2019t necessarily feel angry at these people, because they have their own problems and if they were happy people, they wouldn\u2019t treat others the way they do. But I feel a sense of wanting to be strong, wanting to build my life, and wanting to finally have my confidence back. I have been made to feel like garbage for how I chew, for how I walk, for how I do almost anything and even though I\u2019m not in that abusive situation anymore, I still act and feel like they are right over my shoulder and I don\u2019t have any say in my own life. As if all my thoughts are stupid.\n\nI do not like to feel this, I don\u2019t like to feel angry. It makes me feel ugly and petty. I know how hard life is, even for the people who have hurt me, and I want to feel nothing but graciousness and forgiveness towards them. I guess being clear-headed today is just bringing up a lot of emotions and I\u2019m so grateful I can share my thoughts here.

It\u2019s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  \n\nI hid it from the court, because it\u2019s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.\n\nAfter a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.\n\nIn my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.\n\n10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to \u201cjust climb out\u201d.  That fucking pit...\n\nTold the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I\u2019d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. \n\nThankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t want to deal with these people around me who didn\u2019t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn\u2019t want them to feel like me.  It\u2019s one of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you\u2019re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.\n\nTo avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It\u2019s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.\n\nWhat used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I\u2019ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.

{"id": "103_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I am a college student and I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment. Help Long story, but read if you can. \n\nI came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. \n\nAbout a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. \n\nLots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. \n\nThe day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear \"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said \"one sec\" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. \n\nDuring this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. \n\nSince I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. \n\nIt got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. \n\nDo I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. \n\nI miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. \n\nanything will help.

{"id": "816_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I have PTSD because of a volitile relationship It's a very long story and it's pretty dark. But here goes. I was with this girl for three years and we had a house together, pets, you name it. Well we started fighting a lot and she had self harm issues. Our fights would start out small and next thing you know, we were screaming in the house, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg. She would lock herself in a room and try to cut herself in the middle of these fights, so I would break into the room to stop her (my mind immediately shifting to I'm not fighting with her anymore, I'm going to try and stop her and show her I love her), but she never let up. She would resort to brutally beating me in the face to get me away from her and say the most horrible things to me. She would tell me I was a loser, I was ugly, fat, and all sorts of things that I refuse to remember. I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts. I lied to my friends and said that I got my black eye from work. I remember one time specifically was at AWA, and all of my friends that were there, surrounded me and wouldn't leave me alone about my black eye, which wasn't the first one. I lied to them again and then I told them I had to pee, and went to the bathroom and cried really hard. Fast forward to the end, a couple of years ago. I had a concussion at work. I fell into a running compactor and hit my head, and my boss saved my life. I completely forgot the previous two months, including my sister getting engaged and everything. They wouldn't let me drive or watch movies or anything until I recovered. It was a nightmare. Well I started getting my memory back and she started a fight with me because my friend was coming to see me and she \"wanted to do her workout.\" it escaladed very quickly to the same routine as before only this time I broke a statue that we got together and I threw the flowers I got her on the floor and the cops were called again and said one of us had to leave for the night. She kicked me out and broke up with me and never let me come back. I couldn't drive at the time she made me stay outside until my mom came and got me. I begged her not to do it, because I was in love with her despite everything and she treated me like a criminal and condemned me. She tried to turn all of my friends against me (which failed horribly for the most part) and told everyone that I was the one abusing her. I never touched her like that and I never said anything so horrible to her. I treated her like gold 95% of the time and I cared about her more than anything. I left her a long letter on the porch a week after all of this, explaining how much she meant to me and that I wanted a new start with her and she called the cops to tell me to leave her alone and told everyone that I was a psycho.

{"id": "2641_ptsd", "displayed_text": "What are your flashbacks like? (possibly triggering for sexual abuse, rape, trauma) Hi everyone,\n\nI'm pretty new to this sub and would like some insight into what others feel when they are experiencing flashbacks.\n\nBACKGROUND INFO (skip if you want)\n\nTo give some background information on my experience, I was sexually abused/raped(?) by my step dad 4 years ago (and sexually abused by him multiple times over many years before) but I didn't get any medical help for that although I did tell my mum and boyfriend about it after the \"big happening\". I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. \n\n**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. \n\nFor me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. \n\nWhy do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   \n\nTL;DR\n\nmy flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny feedback would be great.

PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.\n\nTo show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.\n\nMy story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.\n\nIn my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.\n\nIn the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain.
