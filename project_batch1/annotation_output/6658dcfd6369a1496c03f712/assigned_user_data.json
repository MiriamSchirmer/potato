Help Long story, but read if you can. \n\nI came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. \n\nAbout a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. \n\nLots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. \n\nThe day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear \"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said \"one sec\" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. \n\nDuring this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week.

Help Long story, but read if you can. \n\nI came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. \n\nAbout a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. \n\nLots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. \n\nThe day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear \"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said \"one sec\" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. \n\nDuring this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week.

We\u2019ve been through therapy and I\u2019ve had 3 sessions of EMDR that have helped.\n\nHowever no matter how good a session goes with my therapist I go back to my apartment and fall into the same depressive trap every time. All my bad memories are there. We are moving to a different state in less than a month but being at my current situation is eating me alive. \n\nI\u2019m fine when I\u2019m not there, whether that be with her somewhere or at work. My therapist thinks I\u2019m a sense it is \u201cptsd\u201d. I hate most moments I\u2019m there and sleeping helps me get through them faster. Whether it be at night or me feeling down when I initially wake up for the day before work I am a mess. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this to a degree? I can\u2019t stand the fact of going back home today. I\u2019m scared and I think this is what is causing me not to be able to completely get through the issues the girlfriend and I are having because I am constantly reminded of them by where I live. Any help would be appreciated, thanks."}, "3_counseling": {"id": "3_counseling", "text": "I was texting a guy who wasn't my boyfriend, and my boyfriend found out.

As if all my thoughts are stupid.\n\nI do not like to feel this, I don\u2019t like to feel angry. It makes me feel ugly and petty. I know how hard life is, even for the people who have hurt me, and I want to feel nothing but graciousness and forgiveness towards them. I guess being clear-headed today is just bringing up a lot of emotions and I\u2019m so grateful I can share my thoughts here. I hope I will one day feel confident and strong and like my thoughts do matter. By taking care of myself, I hope I can get there. I wish wellness and recovery towards everyone here, thank you for reading :cherry_blossom:\n\nMaybe I\u2019m angriest at myself for letting these people have the hold on me that they did have or do have. Maybe I\u2019m angriest at myself for hurting myself in response to their abuse instead of building."}, "1004_ptsd": {"id": "1004_ptsd", "text": "How do you get through a triggering assignment?
