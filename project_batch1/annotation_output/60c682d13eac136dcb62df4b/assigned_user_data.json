Over the past 2 years, I've been suffering from what at times felt time paralyzing ptsd that I couldn't escape. I'm in Mountain Rescue, and over the past two years I've had missions with nothing but fatalities. The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury. None the less, it was traumatic and recently I started getting anxious and irritable.\n\nToday I got a mission call out for a missing 7 year old girl who went missing at their families camping vacation last night. Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out \"fuck yes\" after I heard on the radio \"we've made contact!\". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. \n\nI'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help. However in the end, I feel like I was given a gift, and a chance to start over and keep my passion for helping others going. I know that many of you on here are in a rut or hole and feel like you cant get out, but please, don't give up. You never know when you might get your chance to rebuild like I did today. I can't say that tomorrow I will be fixed and everything will be better, but I know that today was a milestone, and my path has changed for the better.

Over the past 2 years, I've been suffering from what at times felt time paralyzing ptsd that I couldn't escape. I'm in Mountain Rescue, and over the past two years I've had missions with nothing but fatalities. The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury. None the less, it was traumatic and recently I started getting anxious and irritable.\n\nToday I got a mission call out for a missing 7 year old girl who went missing at their families camping vacation last night. Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out \"fuck yes\" after I heard on the radio \"we've made contact!\". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. \n\nI'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help. However in the end, I feel like I was given a gift, and a chance to start over and keep my passion for helping others going. I know that many of you on here are in a rut or hole and feel like you cant get out, but please, don't give up. You never know when you might get your chance to rebuild like I did today. I can't say that tomorrow I will be fixed and everything will be better, but I know that today was a milestone, and my path has changed for the better. I hope that you too get that chance to improve your path soon.\n\nLove you all and stay strong."}, "1067_counseling": {"id": "1067_counseling", "text": "I've have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?", "displayed_text": "I've have lived for sometime with depression but things have gotten a lot better, but why is it so hard to get over anxiety and social isolation?"}, "533_counseling": {"id": "533_counseling", "text": "There are lots of things you can do, but first: Congratulations on your new job! \u00a0Commuting long distances can be stressful, but there are some things you can do.First, make sure that your seating arrangement in your car is comfortable.
