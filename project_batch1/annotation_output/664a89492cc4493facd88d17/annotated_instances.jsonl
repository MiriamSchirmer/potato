{"id": "1822_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Help Hello, I\u2019ve been suffering from moderate-severe ptsd for about 3 years now and decided to get help about a year ago after some issues. My problem is that I\u2019m currently deployed and many things have been triggering me out here. In a deployed environment I\u2019m not able to get the medication or psychotherapy needed to get me through and I\u2019m at this complete snapping point. I\u2019m currently taking SSRI blockers and medication for the nightmares and daily interactions, but doesn\u2019t seem to take even the slightest edge off.  I feel like any day now I will just lose it, is there anything y\u2019all could recommend to take the edge off?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 449, "end": 467, "span": "daily interactions", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 37s "}}
{"id": "2369_ptsd", "displayed_text": "What do you think, do i have ptsd? Or something else? This is my first post and and would like to know your opinion. What do you think of my situation? What would you do?  \n\nIam 24 years old and for more than a decade iam suffering. My current situation is really difficult. This year i wanted to go to university again, but my medical condition is a living hell. My problem is my body is 24/7 in an \"emergency situation\". That means it feels to me like my own body is a prison/enemy to me. I can barely breathe, i dont sleep well (for years) and my stomach is so hard to the point i feel emotionless. It feels to me this is taking 80% of my energy. Over the year  \"being depressed\" became the new normal for me.\n\nThe relationship to my parents is really difficult. I experienced a lot of abuses. Want some examples?\n- At age 7 i was trying to sleep in a room with my brother in the evening. I was scared of \"monsters\" under the bed, so i asked my little brother if he could come to sleep beside me (children), so i dont need to be scared anymore. A few moments later my fundamental religious father came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground. Then he started to beat my little childrens body with his foot. My stomach hurt was hit by his foot. 1 Minute later my mum came to him, but she just observed and didnt do anything. Then it began to hurt so much, i was thinking i would die. So i crawled on my knees to my mothers feet and told her  \"mommy please tell him to stop\". But he kept going by this time punching me in the face, so blood came out of my nose. As he noticed the blood, he grabbed me by my t-shirt and pulled me like a dog to the bathroom, where he forced me to wash my blood. I was so little i couldnt reach the water so he gave me something to stand above. While cleaning the blood i was crying and most importantly my body was vibrating enormously.\n\n- At age 8 i should take my little brother to play with my friend outdoors. Like most children i wanted to play with my own friends and don't want to ( Alone the fact letting a 5years and 8 years old playing for several hours alone on the street is crazy). Then my father saw me coming down the street and asked where i was, i said \"i was on the playground\". As he knew i didnt take my brother with me, he was so aggressive i got scared of him. I literally was so scared i began to run away from him. I ran the street down and now comes the crazy thing. He began to run wild after me and i screamed as loud as a i could \"HELP\", but nobody noticed. As i couldnt run anymore, i instinctively put my hands before my face, in fear he would punch me in the face. \n\n-At Age 6 i behave badly in the opinion of my parents and they scared to beat me, so i left the building block and waited infront of the bus stop for several hours in the cold. I Brief the whole time and each time a bus come by (every 20 minutes) i started to control it, so no stranger noticed me. Every two minutes i looked to the door, to look if they let me in again.\n\n- At age 16 i was really hungry and cooked a little meal for myself. My father told me i should share it with my brother. I told him no, there is enough left he can cook for himself, he is old enough. He was so angry he took my plate with the food on it and threw it in front of me into the garbage. Then he became more aggressive and and destroyed the plate with a spoon in front my eyes and forced me to clean everything up. At this time school already was really hard for me emotional, so i cried silently desperate while cleaning everything.\n\n- One day at age 15 or so he came in a aggressive mood in my childrens room ( dont remember why), we had a discussion and then began to threat me by coming really near to me, holding his fingers between his teeths saying \"iam craazy\".", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 793, "end": 800, "span": "abuses.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1288, "span": "came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground.
