I was pacing and out of focus and trying to work through it, and I told him that's what was on my mind.\n\nHe continually asked if I was okay, but would interrupt me if I spoke with asking, that was the first sign he really wasn't paying attention (I didn't want extra attention but in case something happened he would at least know which trauma it related to). He then proposed to help me, I said I didn't think there was anything he could do at this moment, and he replied with \"We could have sex, that takes your mind off things!\" \n\nI was shocked, but also so deep in my mind I didn't react right away. He assumed I did not hear him, so he suggested it again, and I told him now isn't the time. He then started playfully grabbing me and saying he was going to make me feel good, asking for sex, and I was IMMEDIATELY covered in this layer of disgust and discomfort, I felt like gagging. I quickly pulled away and yelled NO, and he then made a 'pouty' face and then turned away from me. \n\nI was shaking for about five minutes, unable to move, and felt so dirty and ashamed. \nI got up to leave (I was going to leave around this time anyway), and was very quiet when leaving. He gave me a hug, and squeezed me super tight, which made me yell STOP, and rush out the door. \n\nI have barely spoken to him, and I did get the courage to tell him (through text unfortunately) exactly what happened.

He keeps telling me about his days and then ending with \"oh sorry, I always make it about me,\" and I know him well enough to know he is not intending that statement in a passive aggressive manner, that's just his way of saying he feels he made another mistake through a text.\n\nI feel so guilty because every strong feeling I had for him immediately vanished, I don't want to hurt him, and (selfishly) I don't want to be so alone again.

I know that is silly but I just can\u2019t.\n\nI was in therapy for a year after I got out of hospital (thankfully, in an office that looked nothing like a hospital) and they never gave me a diagnosis more than \u201csevere anxiety &amp; depression.\u201d I suspected I had some kind of ptsd but assumed that it would have come up. Also...I\u2019m not a war vet and my symptoms have been fairly mild compared to some of the stories on here. But then...a couple of friends of mine with ptsd told me I should think about it.\n\nBasically, are my experiences typical of ptsd and should I push through and put myself back in the healthcare system to work this out?\n\nThank you for reading.

{"id": "2641_ptsd", "displayed_text": "What are your flashbacks like? (possibly triggering for sexual abuse, rape, trauma) Hi everyone,\n\nI'm pretty new to this sub and would like some insight into what others feel when they are experiencing flashbacks.\n\nBACKGROUND INFO (skip if you want)\n\nTo give some background information on my experience, I was sexually abused/raped(?) by my step dad 4 years ago (and sexually abused by him multiple times over many years before) but I didn't get any medical help for that although I did tell my mum and boyfriend about it after the \"big happening\". I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. \n\n**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. \n\nFor me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. \n\nWhy do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   \n\nTL;DR\n\nmy flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny feedback would be great.
