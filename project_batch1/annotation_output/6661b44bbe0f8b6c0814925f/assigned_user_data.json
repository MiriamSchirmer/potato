I want to be able to trust people who deserve it, and walk away from people who deserve that without feeling guilty. I want to be the best version of my self so I can raise my son's to be healthy human beings. \n\nI want to be able to like myself. I want to feel like I deserve things. \n\nMy problems, and their dads, have affected them and I want to help them heal to.  I can't fix the past but I can give them a emotionally healthy and stable ready of their childhood. \n\nSo I need therapy.  Probably specific therapy. I don't know how to really go about it. I've tried it before but it's been nothing profound and I have a hard time taking these people's time as if my experiences are as horrific as others who need help more. I tell whiney, complainey, undeserving of telling my story and it holds me back. \n\nI need to be able to unpack my trauma. I need to.  Then I need to work through the emotions. The abandonment, fear, shame, unworthiness. Then I need to put it to bed healthily. Then I need to work with someone to difficult or how I feel about my abusers and what I should do next. \n\nHow do I find someone like this, who can handle the fact that I am so emotionally fragile I may as well be porcelain?
