{"id": "1524_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD from forced sex work A bit of background here - I (29 F) was heavily involved in the drug scene back in my early twenties. Prior to that, in high school, I was very promiscuous (possibly as a result of taking medication meant for depression while actually being bipolar, perhaps sending me into a mania).\n\nIn my drug phase, there were lots of times I\u2019d have sex for drugs. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t expect it - thinking that I could just pay the guy for my drugs like a normal transaction, but they ended up not wanting the money and I\u2019d give in. \n\nthe climax of it all happened when I was desperately looking for a fix and this guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help. I got in the car (I know, stupid as hell) and he ended up getting me a handful of pills. I didn\u2019t know what they were, but I downed all of them. I passed out and then when I woke up, we were hundreds of miles away from where we originally met and he proceeds to explain to me that I\u2019m \u201cgoing to be working for him now\u201d. He was a pimp. \n\nI spent the next few weeks in that situation - he took my cell phone, kept me drugged up, woke me up at 8am everyday to start working until the late hours of night. He\u2019d yell at me if I had any bruises from someone being too rough with me. \n\nI had tried to kill my self then, but it didn\u2019t work and woke up to him screaming at me about it.\n\nThe only way I was able to contact anyone was when I had developed an infection in my arm from IV drug use and he finally (after days of this) agreed to take me to the ER. I called my family from there and thankfully he agreed to just drop me off at the airport where they would pick me up.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about this many times in counseling, but it\u2019s always been like I was talking about the weather. No emotion behind it, just nonchalantly telling the story.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until very recently that I thought about the whole situation and realized that I had been kidnapped. That yes, I was looking for drugs and that was bad, but I was kidnapped and taken captive and used.\n\nSince this realization, I\u2019ve been having flashbacks, especially during sex. And having sex is a whole different can of worms for me - lots of times, my body doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything. It\u2019s like I\u2019m still in prostitution mode, where I act like I\u2019m enjoying it but really can\u2019t wait for it to be over. The only way I can get off is by imagining my partner having sex with other people - it\u2019s like I can\u2019t allow myself and my own body to experience pleasure. Imagining things like that make me feel like a creep and it takes\nsomething that\u2019s supposed to be intimate and skews it into this fucked up thing.\n\n\nLast night, I felt it came to a head. I was having sex with my boyfriend and just began having flashbacks of my time as a prostitute - seeing images of guys putting money on the table, disassociating from my body and I then felt this sensation of such anger that I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted to bit my boyfriend across the face, scratch him, grab his face hard. I feel so terrible about it. I started crying and then of course that ruined the moment and the poor guy had no idea what was going through my head.\n\nHe knows some of what I\u2019ve been through, but there\u2019s so much he doesn\u2019t know and doesn\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t blame him. \n\n\nI want to enjoy sex again. I\u2019m seeing a therapist and am on medication for bipolar, but this shit just haunts me. I can\u2019t tell if I actually enjoy sex or just default to prostitute mode where i make all the sounds and motions of enjoying something, like I\u2019m acting and playing the part. \n\nDoes anyone else have similar stories that they can offer advice about? I\u2019m in such a low spot.

I was officially diagnosed in 2017 after major trauma I dealt with at the hands of a mental health facility. \n\nI know waking up myself and the whole household screaming in my sleep, hearing sounds and voices relating to my trauma, and sleeping with the lights on for years well. I was finding my symptoms easing and being easier to deal with in late 2019 thanks to extensive therapy and working through them one by one but then my Mom died on January 1st of this year right after midnight. \n\nIt was the simple call and \u201cwe regret to inform you,\u201d no. We had went to visit her in ICU. ICU had become a normal occurrence in the infections she kept having but she always bounced back. \n\nWhen we walked in, she didn\u2019t seem any worse than the times before... and then a nurse pulled me to the side to tell me it was bad bad. \n\nI still didn\u2019t believe it, but while we were there they said they were putting her on a ventilator, and I decided to stay the night. \n\nDue to my moms infection and my slight germaphobia, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable holding her hand or being in cough range. Even before the ventilator, she couldn\u2019t respond more than panicked eyes that never looked directly at me and hoarse \u201chelp me\u201d\u2019s between breaths. I couldn\u2019t get her attention even when I did try to tell her it\u2019d be okay and to comfort her. Seeing her like that was crushing me. I decided to let the nurses do their thing while I wished everyone on my social media a happy new year. \n\nThe nurses came in and out to add meds and such to help her breathe, kicked me out to put the ventilator in, but when I was allowed back in they never were gone for more than 10 minutes. I watched my moms machine, and it didn\u2019t stop beeping since we had gotten there but that was normal when o2 levels are below 90. \n\nShe started calming down some so I laid down to sleep.

Her eyes looked gone. I told them to stop. \n\nI remember feeling super numb and floaty. I hadn\u2019t slept in months.

{"id": "2599_ptsd", "displayed_text": "The moment that changed me and my thought process for the rest of my life Stay in my room until work, either sleeping the whole time or manic af from lack of sleep and minimal drug use. Not good i know but i have to start being honest at least w myself. \nI found this year that i enjoy dulling down my reality instead of facing problems. \n\n\u00a0Drugs make me feel something, while dulling down the pain\nI don't want to escape as much as i want to numb my thoughts from hurting myself. When my thoughts become verbal my moods lash out on others and it makes me hate my existence that much more. \nWhich triggers a wave of suicidal thoughts, self doubt, and a can't do attitude. \nI just give up\nI am sick and tired of holding the weight of these ideations within the thin barriers of my skull, im growing old and tierd.\nWhen it started, i thought i brought these thoughts into my head, and i would feel shame for it. For why am i doing this to myself?\n6 years later its gotten progressively worse, i quit drinking and began a regaulr pill regimen\u00a0 (also smoking marajuana) to keep myself balanced, or calm. I was less on edge, found a bit of happiness within myself and my creative side and began to feel human again. \nNow the flip side to that is the rap sheet of side effects that come along with these pills.\nStabalize your mind, sacrifice your body.\nIt's taking a chance everytime, adverse reactions and misdiagnosis over those 6 years didn't help. By the timei was aged 25 i had been on or around 25 different pills and different combinations within of those pills. \nBy the end of my 6 years medication tweaking process, and 3 misdiagnosis, 6 hospitalizations, and pretty much a team of specialists, and a dozen doctors,\u00a0 along w a cat scan of my brain in 2014.\nIt took hell of a toll on my body, and brain functions. My liver an kidneys wont last forever..\nThe runaround, a serious uphill battle im still pushing through..learning a lot about my mind and mostly thought process.\nWhy am i so mean to myself? \n\n\u00a0and as of today my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder bi polar type, i struggle with anxiety (mostly social) and frequent panic attacks (which can be triggered by the way someone i know looks me wrong) me being called sensitive would be a huge understatement. Around the time of my first hospitalization in 2009 i witnessed my friend and roommate at the time get beat within an inch from his life with brass knuckles to the face. \nI remember nothing past the porch where he laid still, getting beat on our own front lawn repeatedly. \nMy mind permanently blocked that from me.Next time i have a memory from that moment im looking over him-- laying in the blood soaked grass, in total shock. His face was a blood puddle, in panic mode i went and scooped him from his back to his feet. At that second i embraced his tall frail figure as his wounds dripped down onto my suicidal tendencies shirt (oh the irony)\u00a0 my arms wrapped all the way around his body, for i just wanted him to feel safty or comfort. Grabbing him by the hand i guidedus to a safer space indoors.\nAround me was a blur, friends and neighbors scolded me, for \"he could have a neck or back injury! Leave him laying!\" \nI was not only in shock, but also processing a violent and traumatic event that changed my life forever. \nI was scared, he was petrified. \nI told all the neighbors and by standers basically to fuck off and\nAs for my friend- now gushing blood from his cuts, eye sockets, mouth and nose. \njust like a skipping cd in your old walkman, he was stuck in a constant shuddering loop fearing for his life. \n\"They're going to come back and kill me\"\nOver and over and over and over..\nOnce into our house i lead him into the bathroom, swiftly locking the door behind.\n\"Call 911, they're going to come back and kill me\" again and again as he ran water over his face, pressing his broken bone structure completely flat, blood pouring from all parts of his kind and beautiful face. \nHe couldn't feel it, he could barely process what had happened, for it happened so fast. \nI watched him try to\nRinse all the blood away only more would streamout.&amp;Panic struck, the ambulance was now on its way but inwas starting to expierence by first delusion. \nAfter that summer i didn't see my friend again until 10 years later. \nWhat i said to him was, i have been through so much since then that stemmed from that dark moment in our past, struggled with literal demons inside my head, woken up to images of corpses laying in my bed. \nBut i will never know how you managed to stay so strong, so beautiful, and so kind even after something so awful could happen. \nI have no idea how he did it i said, how he pulled through and came out on top.\nDude, he could have been beat to death if someone hadn't stepped in. \n\nOne of the moments that shaped me, made me grow and helped me learn so much about myself id never had gotten the chance to if our paths may not have crossed. \nCos i usually think \"man, i wonder what life would've became if these blips in time hadn't happened at all?\"\nMaybe id have some sort of success, or maybe just no chronic disorder that effects almost every aspect of my life in some sort of way. Im unsure, always wonder, then feel weak minded.\nSoon after we went through this i found myself laying on my bare bed, last nights last breath escapingaway as the mourning sun crept through the crack in the window where the card board had shifted.\nI stayed home all alone with my thoughts that night. \nNot knowing how many sleepless nights, and waking nightmares mixed with violent hallucinations id have ahead of me. \nThe mind is a very fragile thing, science knows little about mental illness as it is-so to see me, 4 or 5 days later after that night, days became weeks then into one bad blurred summer.\nTo explain it all in full detail wouldn't make any sense whatsoever -but i basically looked like your local circle k crack head on no sleep talking to the air. \nSad thing is, mental illness and drug addiction look a whole lot alike. \nYour brain looses one to many days of sleep then all the sudden i think im related to\u00a0 Egyptian gods, and my brother is a cannabal living on an ancient Indian burial ground, and theres a government drone disguised as a house fly watching me.\nThe house was alive, and teeth snapped my feet at every step.\nThe windows were breathing. I sawa glimpse of a body on the stain in the laundry room, had conversations with hairless rats and sat in a chair crafted from hitlers bones.\nI could feel the chill air pass, i felt negative spirits, saw shadow people while christmas carolers sang outside my door.\nNone of this was real, this was just a snipit of the things i've seen and heard but told they weren't really there. \nI was awake, yet dreaming in gruesome splashes and disorganized thoughts. \nI was alive to exist. \nI felt pain all over.\nOnce admited i was so unrulyi wasn't able to be near any other patients at least half a day to a day. I spent that time in the yellow hallway in the nude and a pair of flats, pissing on myself while flooding my room. \nWhen they brought my food, i ripped my name badge from the tray. I ate my name for dinner, refused the meal, kicking it across the hallway.\nWater began to trickle out of my room, and by the time they asked me to get dressed they saw..\nI shoved all the sheets, blankets and my clothes into the toilet, and sink only to keep them running and flushing til someone decided to check on my crazy naked ass.\nI just didnt want to be alone.\nSo i made sure they had to keep me close, and segregating an unstable lil girl who wants to die and has no clue what reality is anymore is inhumane. \nI spent the next 3 weeks there making no damn sence, i was completely detached from reality coloring with crayons, banging my head inbetween the door way and the wall. \nIt hurt everywhere in a different way, but they couldnt make it stop so i would hurt myself. \nI hadn't showered in over a week, 2 nurses insisted on helping me bathe. \nOnce in the water all i could do was scream, cry and fight them.\nI was 20.\nLife hit different for me young, and life got in the way of a lot of things but it humbled m\n\n\n-unfinished.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2672, "end": 2770, "span": " looking over him-- laying in the blood soaked grass, in total shock.
