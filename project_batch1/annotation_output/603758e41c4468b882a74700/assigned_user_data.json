Yeah I was sexually abused as a child but that was forever ago and I was never physically abused in my relationships. But on top of depression, anxiety, and avoidant personality disorder, I\u2019ve also just been diagnosed with PTSD stemming from the last couple years. Maybe this is considered complex-PTSD and should be posted there instead? Sorry. \n\nIt felt dumb to me hearing that. I know it\u2019s possible. I guess I\u2019m just in denial. But then I think about it. We didn\u2019t even have a long relationship. 9 months. That\u2019s nothing. But the last 3 months he inflicted more damage than I\u2019d known in 10 years. I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to him since my suicide attempt in September 2018. I\u2019ve sought help. I\u2019m on meds again and in therapy. I\u2019m better than I used to be. Then today I got a message from his gf. There\u2019s a whole backstory to her but it\u2019s honestly just too complicated to explain right now. As soon as I saw her name everything came back. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I was lightheaded and dizzy. My chest was tight. I started sweating and felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe. Like I was about to pass out. (Panic attack, I know) I could see him again perfectly. In my face screaming. I could hear him. Feel his skin. Smell him. Everything. I was watching a movie with my kids (they\u2019re 13 and 11) so I calmly got up and went outside and just completely broke down.\n\nI mean come on, it\u2019s been a year and half. I feel like I\u2019m doing better and then this happens and it\u2019s like being kicked in the teeth right back to square one."}, "2304_ptsd": {"id": "2304_ptsd", "text": "Sacrificed my life to save a loved one I\u2019ve been diagnosed to have PTSD for almost a year now.

Okay, I'm gonna preface this by saying that sometimes I can be a hypochondriac, so there's a chance I'm overreacting.\n\nMy trauma comes from someone close to me attempting suicide, blaming it on me, and then continously blaming his suicidal feelings on me and saying he was thinking of killing himself and only telling me that and guilt tripping me when I tried to call him out on it.\n\nMy symptoms aren't severe, however, I've found myself avoiding the places where the catalyst for all of this happened, and I've had strange instances where I've had nightmares involving the catalyst playing out wordlessly, then turning into a fantasy situation of me running away. I can talk about it, but I will only talk about it if I'm the one who is in charge of the conversation.\n\nBut the worst that's happened is when I walked past that spot, as I need to to get home, I don't remember what happened except for a few splashes, which I remember as the guy who traumatised me. When I looked in car windows for my reflection, or thought, all I could hear were the words he said and all I could see was his reflection, and I could only picture myself as him.\n\nMy therapist said that it happens to a lot of people and that it's nothing to get caught up in, but should I push the possibility of maybe being a bit more traumatised than I've let on? I've only told her about the catalyst, and not everything about the catalyst."}, "2337_counseling": {"id": "2337_counseling", "text": "Two years ago, I was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues.

Leave him laying!\" \nI was not only in shock, but also processing a violent and traumatic event that changed my life forever. \nI was scared, he was petrified. \nI told all the neighbors and by standers basically to fuck off and\nAs for my friend- now gushing blood from his cuts, eye sockets, mouth and nose. \njust like a skipping cd in your old walkman, he was stuck in a constant shuddering loop fearing for his life. \n\"They're going to come back and kill me\"\nOver and over and over and over..\nOnce into our house i lead him into the bathroom, swiftly locking the door behind.\n\"Call 911, they're going to come back and kill me\" again and again as he ran water over his face, pressing his broken bone structure completely flat, blood pouring from all parts of his kind and beautiful face. \nHe couldn't feel it, he could barely process what had happened, for it happened so fast. \nI watched him try to\nRinse all the blood away only more would streamout.&amp;Panic struck, the ambulance was now on its way but inwas starting to expierence by first delusion. \nAfter that summer i didn't see my friend again until 10 years later. \nWhat i said to him was, i have been through so much since then that stemmed from that dark moment in our past, struggled with literal demons inside my head, woken up to images of corpses laying in my bed. \nBut i will never know how you managed to stay so strong, so beautiful, and so kind even after something so awful could happen. \nI have no idea how he did it i said, how he pulled through and came out on top.\nDude, he could have been beat to death if someone hadn't stepped in. \n\nOne of the moments that shaped me, made me grow and helped me learn so much about myself id never had gotten the chance to if our paths may not have crossed. \nCos i usually think \"man, i wonder what life would've became if these blips in time hadn't happened at all?\"\nMaybe id have some sort of success, or maybe just no chronic disorder that effects almost every aspect of my life in some sort of way. Im unsure, always wonder, then feel weak minded.\nSoon after we went through this i found myself laying on my bare bed, last nights last breath escapingaway as the mourning sun crept through the crack in the window where the card board had shifted.\nI stayed home all alone with my thoughts that night. \nNot knowing how many sleepless nights, and waking nightmares mixed with violent hallucinations id have ahead of me. \nThe mind is a very fragile thing, science knows little about mental illness as it is-so to see me, 4 or 5 days later after that night, days became weeks then into one bad blurred summer.\nTo explain it all in full detail wouldn't make any sense whatsoever -but i basically looked like your local circle k crack head on no sleep talking to the air. \nSad thing is, mental illness and drug addiction look a whole lot alike. \nYour brain looses one to many days of sleep then all the sudden i think im related to\u00a0 Egyptian gods, and my brother is a cannabal living on an ancient Indian burial ground, and theres a government drone disguised as a house fly watching me.\nThe house was alive, and teeth snapped my feet at every step.\nThe windows were breathing. I sawa glimpse of a body on the stain in the laundry room, had conversations with hairless rats and sat in a chair crafted from hitlers bones.\nI could feel the chill air pass, i felt negative spirits, saw shadow people while christmas carolers sang outside my door.\nNone of this was real, this was just a snipit of the things i've seen and heard but told they weren't really there. \nI was awake, yet dreaming in gruesome splashes and disorganized thoughts. \nI was alive to exist. \nI felt pain all over.\nOnce admited i was so unrulyi wasn't able to be near any other patients at least half a day to a day. I spent that time in the yellow hallway in the nude and a pair of flats, pissing on myself while flooding my room. \nWhen they brought my food, i ripped my name badge from the tray. I ate my name for dinner, refused the meal, kicking it across the hallway.\nWater began to trickle out of my room, and by the time they asked me to get dressed they saw..\nI shoved all the sheets, blankets and my clothes into the toilet, and sink only to keep them running and flushing til someone decided to check on my crazy naked ass.\nI just didnt want to be alone.\nSo i made sure they had to keep me close, and segregating an unstable lil girl who wants to die and has no clue what reality is anymore is inhumane. \nI spent the next 3 weeks there making no damn sence, i was completely detached from reality coloring with crayons, banging my head inbetween the door way and the wall. \nIt hurt everywhere in a different way, but they couldnt make it stop so i would hurt myself. \nI hadn't showered in over a week, 2 nurses insisted on helping me bathe. \nOnce in the water all i could do was scream, cry and fight them.\nI was 20.\nLife hit different for me young, and life got in the way of a lot of things but it humbled m\n\n\n-unfinished."}, "2690_counseling": {"id": "2690_counseling", "text": "It's hard when you feel as if you're the only one that's taking the time to listen to your spouse.
