I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7\" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2\" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.

I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.

I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.

Background on me: PTSD diagnosed , childhood trauma, I don\u2019t remember a lot of my childhood and continue (as an adult) to go into black out mode when things get tough. I am a virgin who plans to stay one till marriage because of sexual trauma. \n\nI dated a guy for three months who lied a lot. It was the peak of my drinking problem (70 something days sober). I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend. He would drink nothing. I would go in my room thinking I passed out but we would still do sexual things that was not sex. Remember I am a virgin. \n\nOne night I got so drunk I don\u2019t remember making it to bed. He knew how much I drank. He never said anything. If anything encouraged by buying alcohol for me and my roommate. I woke up the next day with awful vaginal pain. When I peed it felt like my insides were ripped and I had blood in my urine. That lasted for three days before slowly fading away. When I asked my ex about it he said he used three fingers and that\u2019s why. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. \n\nI got drunk a few more times but not blackout and we do things again. I try to set boundaries with him about it realizing I needed to and he texted me \u201cI didn\u2019t rape you\u201d I didn\u2019t think anything of it because rape is such a triggering thing. I shut it down super quick. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is rape or not because when I would get drunk I would ask to have sex but he would say no. He knew I wanted to wait and he wanted to be a good boyfriend. But the three finger excuse didn\u2019t make sense because we consensually used that many before and it didn\u2019t feel that way. I didn\u2019t feel torn and I didn\u2019t bleed. Do you think he waited till I was so unconscious to do something?

Background on me: PTSD diagnosed , childhood trauma, I don\u2019t remember a lot of my childhood and continue (as an adult) to go into black out mode when things get tough. I am a virgin who plans to stay one till marriage because of sexual trauma. \n\nI dated a guy for three months who lied a lot. It was the peak of my drinking problem (70 something days sober). I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend. He would drink nothing. I would go in my room thinking I passed out but we would still do sexual things that was not sex. Remember I am a virgin. \n\nOne night I got so drunk I don\u2019t remember making it to bed. He knew how much I drank. He never said anything. If anything encouraged by buying alcohol for me and my roommate. I woke up the next day with awful vaginal pain. When I peed it felt like my insides were ripped and I had blood in my urine. That lasted for three days before slowly fading away. When I asked my ex about it he said he used three fingers and that\u2019s why. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. \n\nI got drunk a few more times but not blackout and we do things again. I try to set boundaries with him about it realizing I needed to and he texted me \u201cI didn\u2019t rape you\u201d I didn\u2019t think anything of it because rape is such a triggering thing.

I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter\u2019s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn\u2019t discuss my stepdaughter\u2019s matters with him.\n   The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone.
