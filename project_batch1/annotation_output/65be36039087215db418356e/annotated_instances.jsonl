{"id": "1199_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**\n\n\n\n**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7\" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2\" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.\n\nFast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  \n\nAnother episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.\n\nI know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.\n\nSorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.\n\n**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**\n\n\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 163, "end": 284, "span": "I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 916, "end": 1008, "span": "he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1184, "span": "fter handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 34s "}}

Our fights would start out small and next thing you know, we were screaming in the house, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg.

She would resort to brutally beating me in the face to get me away from her and say the most horrible things to me.

I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts. I lied to my friends and said that I got my black eye from work.

Examples: 1) Asking me to move back interstate by myself because that was my place of employment and they are worried about my job security, even though that was where the incident happened. 2) Leaving me to walk by myself rather than escorting me for an appointment because they judged the situation to be safe and that I should be ready to do this by now. \n\nAlready explained to them that psychologist had said I had been pushing myself when I wasn't ready and I need to stop doing that.
