The last month or so I have started locking and unlocking my apartment doors, 10,20...30 times a night when I am triggered at night. This past week I have been doing it even when I am not triggered, for example when I return from work I will lock the door and then unlock and lock it a dozen times. My therapist suggested giving myself a limit of how many times I can do this and resist the temptation to continue by distracting myself. \nAny tips for this?
