{"id": "1112_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD and digitizing childhood vhs tapes Hi, I need to talk about this because I don't have anyone I'm comfortable sharing with.\n\nI am going to bring up a couple things that I'm struggling with and share some background so this makes sense. I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.\n\nI realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.\n\n**Background**\n\nGrowing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she \"made it to where I didn't have to testify\". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.\n\nI had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by \"quickly and physically ending the disagreement\". After hearing that I got out of his car, said \"goodbye\" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for \"leaving\" them.\n\n**The Videos**\n\nI started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought \"Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first.\" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled \"1996\" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying \"no\" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?\n\nI was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from \"1996\" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks \"right?\" to my sister and she says something like \"only mom and dad think \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is a brat.\" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.\n\nI gave myself a couple days after that footage. I was afraid I'd see something worse. I decided to watch my sisters birthday party in 1996. It was on another tape labeled \"1996\". My sister is turning 5 and we are at the local pool with some childhood friends and some family. I see my cousin and I see my childhood friend. I instantly remember inappropriate things happening with those boys. My cousin used to pretend we were \"married\" when we were around that age. He would make me go into a bathroom after our \"marriage\" and undress with him. He always locked the door. He is about 2 years older than I am. I remember feeling like it was wrong but that he was older so it must be ok. I don't remember much of what happened in the bathrooms when this stuff used to happen. I know for sure it happened in 2 places. I know I was crying at one of them and my sister was knocking on the door. It was a family vacation. He has a daughter now and she is about 5. I hate him.\n\nMy childhood friend I mentioned, he also made me take my clothes off because of what \"grown ups do when they get married\". This must have been at the same age as my cousin incident. I remember something weird he did once he made me lay on top of him, he said we had to touch nipples....then I remember his mother walked in on us. I felt instant embarrassment and guilt, but being so young, I didn't know exactly what was wrong. She never said anything or did anything. This friend is still in my life and also has a brand new daughter. They were at my wedding and so was that cousin. I feel sick thinking about this. How could his mother not have done anything!!?? I saw her face in that video too and felt even more sick. Once we were in the high school ages, we spent more time together. He talked me into cheating on my boyfriends because \"kissing isn't cheating\". He'd feel me up and I told myself it was ok because we weren't having sex. I hate myself for this.\n\nI hate seeing these people on my video tapes and remembering these things. It makes me feel like my family isn't real. It makes me question if things really happened even though I know certain things definitely did. I continue to doubt myself and pretend I'm ok. I'm not ok. I'm having a very hard time with these new things and I feel physically sick reliving these things.\n\n**Can having abusers in life be a pattern for some survivors?**\n\nI have had far too many moments in my life where my innocence was taken from me or I was hurt in different ways. I was raped by an ex for years. He took photos of me after he drugged me when he took me out of the country. He was so much like my father. So many red flags and I should have ran screaming, but he was SO manipulative. He told me no one would ever love me like he loved me. He exposed me to HEP-C for years and never told me. He cheated on me. He would tell me I was overweight and that my style was boring. He told me I didn't \"do anything\". He would force me to have sex with him every day multiple times a day. I was fresh from treatment, he was sober and had been for years. I thought he was safe. He even convinced my mother he was great along with other family. He has thousands of nude photos of me from the age of 18-22. He refused to destroy them when I begged for many years. He'd always convince me to come back when I'd leave him or when he said something painfully horrible. He'd show up at my apartments while I was in college in the middle of the night yelling at me. He was a 3x felon. He was an addict and when I left for good, he started drinking again and then using drugs. No idea where he is now, but I pray it's prison. He had his 3 strikes.\n\nI also have been in a friendship where a guy in college became obsessed with me and stalked me. I had to go to the Dean of Students because he had signed up to be in every one of my classes. This was after he had left things at my doorstep, stood outside my front door at 3am whispering my name and sending me paragraphs about how he wanted to \"practice having sex\" with me \"because we are best friends\" and he \"felt like I would give him feedback\" *WHAT THE FUCK!?* \\- Guess what - the college only asked him to change classes. That's it. The Dean told me they would kick him out of the college, expel him from classes that semester or ask him to change his classes. I had to tell all my professors on my own because the college didn't have my back. He even showed up in NY when I moved after college, and I moved across the country.....I finally got rid of him when I moved from NY.\n\nThere was a guy in college who raped me because I was too drunk to drive home one night. He offered his bed and he slept on the couch until he joined me in bed later that night. I woke up and he was having sex with me. I remember he noticed I woke up and put a condom on. I was frozen. I didn't know what to do. I left when I could see the sun was coming up. I wouldn't talk to him and he acted like he didn't know what was wrong. He'd even send me texts if he was on the same bus to tell me he was behind me. I'm still confused by that.\n\nI'm sorry I spilled this mess here. I have a lot in my head and I don't know how to get it out. I have no one to talk to. No one understands unless they've had these things happen. I'm tired of sharing with someone I feel I can share with and they tell me they don't believe me, or ghost me completely. I had began to keep it all to myself for a few years in college and now I'm busting at the seams with flashbacks and panic attacks. I had a flashback when I was skiing with my husband this year. My father did things to me once when he was teaching me to ski as a kid. I was in the trees and it all came back. I don't know how to talk to my husband about these things. He doesn't understand. He means well and he's good to me, but he will never understand what I feel and what happened to me. I've never been able to really heal from any of this and I'm just now remembering things. I feel like a pile of used, damaged crap. I'm in a new city now, and I don't have any close friends here. I feel lonely and these flashbacks have affected my social abilities. I'm always on edge and I just thought I could share on here and someone might be able to tell me I'm not crazy and that I'm not bad for what happened.

It's not something that's particularly weighing heavy on me, I just wanted some input. I'm a 23 year old male from Columbus, Ohio also.\n\nLast fall/summer I was the victim of domestic abuse. My girlfriend at the time beat the shit out of me without any warning, it was my first and hopefully last time ever experiencing something of the sort and the fact that someone I loved so deeply could have did that was what really made it worse more than anything... It was only one time that this happened.\n\nThere's been a few times where I'll be laying in bed before I go to sleep and I'll see flashbacks of it and go into a panic attack. The way she breathed heavily before it happened, nearly hyperventilating. The way she marched up to me in silence and hit me square in the face... me repeatedly screaming at her to stop whilst trying to restrain her. It all would just come out right before bed but never during my day and these panic attacks maybe happened 2-3 times. This was in the first month after it happened and it hasn't really happened since... as time went on I accepted what happened. Or atleast thought I did...\n\nFast forward nearly 4 months. Just yesterday when I was at work, I was minding my own business doing my job when I heard a woman frantically yelling at somebody somewhere across the warehouse. It very much reminded me of the way my ex yelled at me the way she did that night when she assaulted me.. The type of loud yelling from a woman where their voice starts to grow hoarse from it while they're yelling. Idk it's hard to describe... but suddenly, I stopped what I was doing and began to shake and hyperventilate as those same flashbacks of that night I described started happening. I put my scanner down and went to the bathroom and had a panic attack on the floor.\n\nThe reason I'm not sure if it is PTSD is because it was just one instance where domestic violence occurred in my life, to me it could just be me still not being able to accept what happened. Normally you hear about the common case of combat veterans, rape victims or people who endured prolonged abuse in a relationship that develop PTSD but I feel like one instance of abuse like that shouldn't cause someone to develop it... or maybe it can.

I welcomed my biggest blessing my son on feb 4th, then 9 days later that joy turned to the most traumatic thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. \n\nA quick back story: I had my child when i was 21. The birth of my son was very painless and the whole experience was very positive. No painful contractions, no complications with the csection or anything.\n\nBack to the story. after a csection they give you narcotic pain meds. On feb 13th i started weening myself off the pills because i wasn\u2019t in that much pain anymore. That whole day i felt like something was off in my body. I had chills but my body was hot and i felt nauseous. I figured it was the effects from no longer taking the pain meds. After hours of not feeling well my dad took my temperature and it was 104.3. My dad kept my baby while my boyfriend took me to the hospital. \n\nUpon arriving and telling them my symptoms i was immediately swarmed my so many doctors and nurses like the scene of a movie.

You\u2019d think those are pretty simple fixes. Wrong. \n\nI spent 2 weeks in the hospital and i barely have any memory of most of it but i remember flashes. \n\nDuring that time i had several blood transfusions, blood drawn every 3 hours everyday for 2 weeks and they stuck me in a different vein every time, got given heparin (blood thinner) for the blood clot which they later realized i was allergic to do they switched me to another blood thinner, got given so many different antibiotics for the sepsis, had 3 different IV\u2019s at the same time and a PICC line, had a foley Catheter and a feeding tube, was in the icu in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator, had to do physical therapy to walk, had to get my lungs drained after catching pneumonia from the ventilator, had to get fluid sucked out of my abdomen via ct machine needle insertion, and so many tests and labs i can\u2019t keep up. \n\nWas sent home with 11 prescription as well as a blood thinner injection i had to give myself everyday.

Actually, this was almost ten years ago I received this diagnosis. \n\nAt the time, I was in disbelief and thought the guy was a quack. I've never been in combat, never been in a major accident and never had anything extremely traumatic happen to me. Now like may children of my generation (1980s) I was beaten quite a bit by my dad which I know is messed up, and then I was intensely bullied in childhood for several years. But that's the worst of it. I don't think my childhood was exceptional, just frustrating. \n\nBut after speaking with people close to me, and going through the checklist of symptoms, it was undeniable. So I accepted the diagnosis. Eventually I got a prescription for Wellbutrin and it helped me manage many of my symptoms somewhat for the past decade. \n\nLately I've been going through some stressful external events and a month ago due to lack of sleep + stress I had a bit of a freakout with somebody I've been seeing. While my behavior was forgiven, trust was rattled, and it made me rethink about my old diagnosis. Lately I've taken extremely low doses of Xanax (.25 mg) during stressful moments  take the edge off and it's been helpful.

{"id": "344_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Did I have a marijuana induced episode? Hi all!\n\nNew member here. \nBasically went through some very rough stuff throughout childhood and witnessed very scary domestic abuse between my parents. Lots of yelling (my dad can be very scary) hitting in front of me, etc.\nTo this day my parents are still married and the physical fighting has subsided, yet they will still get into a yelling/ door slamming match every now and then that just sends me into tears despite being 20 years old. I still hate all forms of yelling/voice raising. Even when my mom is just calling a sibling from the other room, I shudder at the sound of just her yelling. \n\nThe other night, I was smoking with my sister and her friends. I used to be a frequent smoker, nearly everyday mostly and every single day occasionally for a few months here and there, mostly to deal with depression and such. However we were taking dabs, which I have taken before without this effect, but clearly I got much more high a lot quicker than from a bowl or blunt. Anyway, I proceeded to go lay on the couch in my basement and I SWORE I could hear my dad clear as day screaming at my mom. I knew I was super high and scared, but over and over I would hear his voice in my head. I went upstairs and checked, they were completely fast asleep.\n\nWas this some form of ptsd that was triggered by being high? Is this possible? I just felt so scared and my heart was beating extremely hard at the sheer thought of my dad yelling.

We used to take trips to Tijuana regularly because it was about 4 hrs away from our home. My first negative experience with figures of authority involved border agents sending us to secondary revision because my father didn't understand English very well and responded incorrectly to one of the questions. They asked if we brought anything from Mexico and he said no but because we had grocery bags in the back that was enough to cause suspicion. We were let go eventually but I still remember the dread of the event. Recently, I've had to deal with police officers coming to my residence looking for someone claiming to have an arrest warrant. The three times they were here I felt insulted, violated, subhuman. The police have insulted my disability. They've forced their way into my home while claiming to be willing to talk outside. They've threatened to break down doors. I've reached out to friends in activist circles and they've helped me deal with some of the trauma and given me information about organizations to reach out to. I've only been able to sleep sporadically. I'm afraid to open doors or go outside. I haven't been taking my meds. Everytime I feel like I'm making progress, something gets in the way of my recovery.
