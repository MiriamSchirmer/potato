{"id": "2233_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I think my abuser did more to me than I realize TW: Childhood sexual assault/rape When I was young, before preschool/kindergarten, I was babysat by a mormon woman. She had two children, a daughter my age and a son who was in middle/high school. The daughter was my best friend at the time and the son was mentally challenged. He would lure me into his room by playing the \"Barbie Girl\" song by Aqua, I loved Barbies. The mother would always make him take me to the bathroom, even though I knew where it was. He would touch me and force me to touch him. I still remember how cramped the space was and how he would stand in the stall with me while I went to the bathroom. I still remember how hot his penis always was. The babysitting stopped when I came home one day and told my mom that he had shoved his tongue in my mouth/down my throat. But neither of my parents knew the extent of the abuse until I was in middle school, half a state away.\n\nRecently, I've come to the age where I should be getting a regular physical. The thought of opening my legs to anyone, let alone my female doctor, horrifies me to an extent I've never been frightened before. Even before she could explain anything, I was in tears and shaking uncontrollably. The speculum looks like a weapon to me. Even the thought of being in a hospital gown scares me. She says that I don't need to have one, but I want to have children and getting a physical is the first step to understanding my full health spectrum. I'm in therapy because I couldn't go through with the physical, and I still haven't been able to do it one year later. She won't put me out for it and only offers me ibuprofen and xanax.\n\nLast night, even just thinking about the physical had me shaking and in tears. I curled up in a ball and closed my legs as tight as I could. Even now, typing this, I have my legs crossed tight. I think the son of my babysitter must have done more to me than just touching. I don't know how to cope with this. I'm still a virgin and have never had a real boyfriend. The last guy that tried to have sex with me was very insistent and I wasn't ready. He was disappointed and stopped talking to me when I pushed him away and accused him of only wanting me for sex. I want to have kids and I want to have sex, but I want to have them with someone I trust and love and who loves and trusts me back. I also have a horrible gag reflex and fear of blowjobs. I know that talking to my therapist is the best way to work through all of this but I have other issues that have taken precedence at the moment. I guess I just wanted to have the idea somewhere and vent a little.

I have monthly nightmares about him throwing things at me, cursing at me and threatening me with objects, he did much more but for some reason I usually just dream about the anger and intimidation prior to the actual acts themselves. I think because it was that stage that lasted the longest (an hour or two), it hurt me more mentally than the usual 30 seconds to a minute of when he did hurt me physically, Idk maybe easier to block out than the awful screaming and personal attacks.\nI also get nightmares of the cheating and of being an inadequate woman. \n\nI also have noticed I tend to flinch pretty dramatically when things are thrown or tossed at me when I'm unaware. My depression and anxiety have gotten so bad and I started seeing a counselor last year, and started medication. I've gained  20-30 pounds because i just feel like it's pointless to care about my appearance half the time, my self confidence is really jacked up now. I use to be such a happy person. I always had depression and anxiety but it feels amplified now. It's like I just have a pit in my stomach all the time.\n\n I use to wear fun dresses and high heels. I use to go on spontaneous adventures. I use to be so carefree and trusting. I'm a fat shell of who I use to be, and it really hurts me when people bring up how fun I use to be. I don't like being unfun, but it's been so hard to dig myself out. I also have 2 young kids which doen't help either lol. I do try,  I try to self care and do what use to make me happy but it just doesn't work.\n\nI recently started therapy and meds for depression and anxiety and it took a few visits to bring it up , I felt dismissed , she said \"he was young\". No I wasn't talking to you to fucking justify it but being on state health insurance it's hard to find good ones out of the few approved therapists in your area. \n\nShit when I told my separate doctor that prescribes them that my anxiety didn't feel any better she only had 1 other med to try and then basically said if that didn't work then I just wont have an anxiety medicine that works for me.
