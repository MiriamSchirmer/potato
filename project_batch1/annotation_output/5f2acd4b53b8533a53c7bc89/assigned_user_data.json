No way. I didn\u2019t even know there was a window there\u2026.\u201d\n\nEventually, I was given my diagnosis. It was hard to breathe. I thought all my little quarks where \u201cGod-given\u201d. Things like \u2013 I\u2019ve never lost my car in a parking lot, no matter the circumstances \u2013 I know when an actor is wearing contacts that slightly change the color of their natural eyes \u2013 I can tell the make of most cars in the dark just by their head-lights. These are all survival tactics my brain has developed over my lifetime living with PTSD.\n\nWhy would I have this? I wasn\u2019t in a war. I wasn\u2019t a victim of domestic violence. This is what I associated with PTSD, at the time. My Art Therapist explained that PTSD can happen when the brain feels extremely unsafe. The situations vary with each person and their age at the time of the event.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I was diagnosed and I\u2019ve met so many people who also live with PTSD. One of them is our friend, Kim Preske. This week, she shares her vision board story of self-care and living with PTSD.

At the time of diagnosis, things in my life were going great. I had decided to try Art Therapy to tap into my own creativity and learn some new techniques. At the very first meeting, the therapist asked me simple questions that started to unnerve me.\n\n\u201cDo you sit facing doors and windows?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cLook at where you are sitting.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cIf that window behind you was a door, would you have sat there?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not. No way. I didn\u2019t even know there was a window there\u2026.\u201d\n\nEventually, I was given my diagnosis. It was hard to breathe. I thought all my little quarks where \u201cGod-given\u201d. Things like \u2013 I\u2019ve never lost my car in a parking lot, no matter the circumstances \u2013 I know when an actor is wearing contacts that slightly change the color of their natural eyes \u2013 I can tell the make of most cars in the dark just by their head-lights. These are all survival tactics my brain has developed over my lifetime living with PTSD.\n\nWhy would I have this? I wasn\u2019t in a war. I wasn\u2019t a victim of domestic violence. This is what I associated with PTSD, at the time. My Art Therapist explained that PTSD can happen when the brain feels extremely unsafe. The situations vary with each person and their age at the time of the event.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I was diagnosed and I\u2019ve met so many people who also live with PTSD. One of them is our friend, Kim Preske. This week, she shares her vision board story of self-care and living with PTSD. The images she was drawn to manifested in a completely different and amazing way than she ever expected.

It was a horse hadn't ridden much and wasn't used to its mannerisms.

The owners seemed to think this horse was a good match, however, upon riding the horse I discovered that it was extremely flighty. It didn't listen to me at all and would just bolt off in random directions at a full gallop no matter how hard I tried to pull it back. At this point, I started to panic. I didn't like feeling like I wasn't in control of the animal. Eventually it threw me off, hard. I was okay, but determined to see if I could control this horse, I got on again. This was a mistake. The second time it threw me off at a full gallop (around 60km/h) and I landed on my head. I had a bad concussion and couldn't see properly.

I felt paralysed by fear.\n\nAfter recovering from my physical injuries, I attempted to resume riding lessons but this failed.

First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to \"listen to her point of view because she had listened to me.\" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our \"conversation.\" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.\n\nAt some point in this \"conversation\" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say \"No\" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said \"nice talking to you guys.\" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.\n\nIn the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way \"there\".  \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways.

I lost the apartment I was living in due to not paying rent and I ended up with a friend of his that lived in the complex and was also a tweaker and much older than me. This is where it got very bad, he was very sadistic and verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. He told me he was intentionally trying to make me go crazy, and he would just stand there and smile and taunt me when he got me to the point of crying. He talked about ways to kill me, and weird things like splitting my mind and making me reborn and being one of the \"elite\" by being tortured. Just really insane and confusing and he kept me in a constant state of anxiety to the point where I would have panic attacks when he wasn't home, especially after I found him hiding in the pantry when I thought he had left... he was physically abusive as well but it went deeper than the \"normal\" abuse because he would have a totally different voice, different face everything when he would talk about that weird stuff it literally scared me to my core because it was like being talked to by a demon... and he made me feel so dehumanized and worthless, he told me there were all these things wrong with me and I developed a fear of going outside which lead to me being trapped in the apartment with him for 7 months. I believe he drugged me as well as revenge for having him put in jail but that is a whole other long and horrible story. All of this happened in a short period of time. \n\nMy memory is really messed up when it comes to all of that. I don't know exactly when it began, and there are huge chunks of time missing. I actually had a point where I just \"woke up\" but I was sitting in my bed, I didn't remember ANYTHING for several minutes and even as things came back to me, I had this horrible weird feeling like my name and my room were not mine. I didn't know what I was doing before that and my bed and the furniture were moved and I still don't remember moving anything. I have never understood that but when this happened I returned to the abusive guy (I was all alone, as an addict he was the ONLY person who still talked to me and at that point I was convinced that I was crazy and none of the things he did happened) and he acted all emotional and told me some weird stuff about how it finally happened and that \"Caeley #1\" has died and I was now \"Caeley #2\". It made me feel more alone and terrified and I now wonder about the possibility of having DID (I had traumatic things happen as a child) or if it's part of PTSD and depersonalization/derealization disorder I've been diagnosed with. \n\nAnother thing I wonder about is why I am so emotionally detached from my memories. I remember it like it happened to someone else and I was watching, not like it happened to me. It makes me wonder if I even have PTSD at all. I only hear about people with PTSD being fearful and crying and everything but I am not like that, yet it still affects me and my life in other ways. Until recently (I think having a baby has changed it) I was unable to cry. I talk about it constantly, I think about it constantly, but it's the same memories over and over and I feel nothing when I think about them, just disturbed by the lack of feeling. I feel like not feeling anything makes it even harder to move past it... it's like I'm stuck. Like I blocked out the emotions then when they got too horrible to deal with and then I just stayed like that. I cry about other things, I feel love and everything but I'm totally detached from the memories. I factually know how I felt then. I know I was in absolute despair and so much pain but like someone else TOLD me how they felt. \n\nWhen I talk about this stuff, I do not feel any anxiety at all, but my back tightens up and I begin shaking and getting cold, every time. When I'm talking about it out loud, if I go on too long the tightness in my back spreads through my body and makes it hard for me to breathe and I have to stop talking. Once I stop talking about it, it goes away. It has made it difficult for me to explain everything to a therapist. It's very weird and I'm serious when I say I do not feel the anxiety whatsoever when I talk about it... it's just my body reacting that way. When I was typing what happened, I got those physical symptoms and when I started typing this, it faded away. Is it still PTSD if I am emotionally detached from the memories? Is there a type of therapist or someone that can help me connect to those memories and move past it? I was seeing a counselor in my home town but I got married and moved, and she wasn't helping any way because she didn't understand what I meant when I told her about the detachment.

Some of them have turned into physical fights,well most of them...and I always see all of it!and I have seen my mom get pushed and her finger get snapped/broken by her bf.she obviously has to fight back for self defence so she does..but he try\u2019s to convince her to give him another chance and that he will change.he says that every single time and yet he still haven\u2019t changed.I even told my mom that...they suffer from alcohol education and my mom thinks that\u2019s the only way she can fall asleep.and some times she gets black out drunk and gets mad at me easy and when I say something that makes her upset... she takes it out on me and if not me her bf mostly her bf tho.. but some fight have scared me half to death bc I thought it was gonna end up in death.
