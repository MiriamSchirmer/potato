I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.", "displayed_text": "Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend.  It\u2019s like I can't get past it, and I need some kind of closure.  I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention.  Nothing was ever wrong with it.  Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place. \n   Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago.  I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s.  Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match.  We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out.  I tell him everything.  Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well.  He\u2019s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing.  That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off.  Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend.  His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited.  I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run.  They're supposed to move in together soon.  But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too.     I don't know what to do.  I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this.  I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy.  I\u2019m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling.  He\u2019s such a good person.  I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head.  I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing.  I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever."}, "2265_incel": {"id": "2265_incel", "text": " I guess that's almost a relief.
