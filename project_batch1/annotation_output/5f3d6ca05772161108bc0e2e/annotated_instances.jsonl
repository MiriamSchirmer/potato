{"id": "2288_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Treatment Well after finishing 12 weeks of a trauma therapy program, I\u2019m going to go away to \u201cresidential\u201d treatment. I was like \u201cwtf,\u201d is this even voluntary? Turns out it is. I could have stayed home and continued trying to fix myself. I completed a trauma level 1 program and opted to go the intensive route by completing the next step the right way. I have to be away from everyone and can\u2019t have electronics. I will miss you, Reddit! \nI finished the program I was in with many women who are vets or have husbands serving. I think this was the key for me to really accept my PTSD. I didn\u2019t fully absorb it before seeing these women react to situations and explain their emotions the way I did. We\u2019re not crazy. We aren\u2019t \u201coverly emotional.\u201d You give an asthmatic an inhaler for a reason. You give someone with severe, chronic PTSD skills to avoid panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares for the same reason; in that regard, its all the same. Trauma itself is much like pain: you can\u2019t compare it. It is what it is. When you\u2019re stuck in fight or flight mode, you need to learn skills to turn it off. This is through DBT. I have been panic attack free for awhile now, have not had self harming thoughts, or any other \u201ccrazy\u201d feeling that could potentially occur due to PTSD. It\u2019s all brain damage.\nMost trauma treatment is voluntary, and you need to find them on your own. I highly recommend each of you find a psychologist- not a \u201ctherapist\u201d to treat PTSD. My trauma occurred in my childhood. My psychologist now treats adults, but many of us were abused as children. His background is working with dyfus cases and treating children. Get a good psychiatrist you can trust- I am on 6 medications: 2 for nightmares and sleep, 2 for anxiety, and 2 for depression. NO ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDS BECAUSE IM NOT CRAZY.\nPTSD is brain damage, and that\u2019s how it needs to be treated.\nI\u2019m extremely mistrusting of the system and had to do this all my way. My husband is a great support, and I know many of you don\u2019t have the support you need. I\u2019m praying for you.\nI hit the lottery when I found my psychologist. He wanted me to face my trauma last year by doing this, and I couldn\u2019t because I knew i wasn\u2019t ready. 2 years after starting therapy, I had the courage to do this.\nMy point is; no matter what state or insurance you have, it\u2019s your responsibility to take care of your mental health to the best of your ability and capacity. \nI wish you all the best as I say bye to Reddit and begin the next chapter in my journey. Going to the west coast VOLUNTARILY so I can leave behind some mistrust, anger, and worry and do what I need to do the right way - no visitors, no contact 30 days.

She had two children, a daughter my age and a son who was in middle/high school. The daughter was my best friend at the time and the son was mentally challenged. He would lure me into his room by playing the \"Barbie Girl\" song by Aqua, I loved Barbies. The mother would always make him take me to the bathroom, even though I knew where it was. He would touch me and force me to touch him. I still remember how cramped the space was and how he would stand in the stall with me while I went to the bathroom. I still remember how hot his penis always was. The babysitting stopped when I came home one day and told my mom that he had shoved his tongue in my mouth/down my throat. But neither of my parents knew the extent of the abuse until I was in middle school, half a state away.\n\nRecently, I've come to the age where I should be getting a regular physical. The thought of opening my legs to anyone, let alone my female doctor, horrifies me to an extent I've never been frightened before. Even before she could explain anything, I was in tears and shaking uncontrollably. The speculum looks like a weapon to me. Even the thought of being in a hospital gown scares me. She says that I don't need to have one, but I want to have children and getting a physical is the first step to understanding my full health spectrum. I'm in therapy because I couldn't go through with the physical, and I still haven't been able to do it one year later. She won't put me out for it and only offers me ibuprofen and xanax.\n\nLast night, even just thinking about the physical had me shaking and in tears. I curled up in a ball and closed my legs as tight as I could. Even now, typing this, I have my legs crossed tight. I think the son of my babysitter must have done more to me than just touching. I don't know how to cope with this. I'm still a virgin and have never had a real boyfriend. The last guy that tried to have sex with me was very insistent and I wasn't ready. He was disappointed and stopped talking to me when I pushed him away and accused him of only wanting me for sex. I want to have kids and I want to have sex, but I want to have them with someone I trust and love and who loves and trusts me back. I also have a horrible gag reflex and fear of blowjobs. I know that talking to my therapist is the best way to work through all of this but I have other issues that have taken precedence at the moment.
