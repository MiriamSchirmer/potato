{"id": "2372_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Sudden realization has shook me as a person (note: I know diagnosis posts are not allowed. I am not requesting that. I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent/ramble/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)\n\nI had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. \n\nI've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. \n\nNope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. \n\nAnd then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then \"wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?\" \n\nAnd then the floodgates started to open. \n\n*  \"Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable\"      \n* \"Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.\"      \n* \"I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me. All two of the physical fights I have been in, have been with him when he was in the house and I snapped after he wouldn't leave despite me begging mom to have him leave\"      \n* \"What are the other symptoms of ptsd? (googles) ... disturbed sleep? ...\" (i am a violent sleeper. i dont put sheets on anymore as they 100% always are ripped off as i thrash in my sleep\"     \n* \"and... shouting in your sleep? ......\" (no conscious memory, but apparently every night i shout out things. my mom doesnt mention it much anymore unless it was a bad night, but whenever i share a hotel with someone I wake up to \"why were you shouting \"stop go away stop\" at 3 AM?\")           \n* \"what else cou- nightmares too?\" (never related to trauma in a way i can discern, but have nightmares that wake me up screaming in about 1/3 sleeps)             \n* \"exaggerated startle response? Does that mean what I think? ... Yes. ... fuck...\" (its not quite as severe anymore but i used to invariably freak out if someone touched me without me seeing it. My dad(never hit me, never abused me, was the chill parent) used to poke me in the car at random, just jokingly. I would flinch and recoil every time. Eventually I got to a point where I would sit pushed against the passenger side door to try and get away from it. He asked me at the time why I flinched and got scared, he never hit me. I didnt know why I did that but I couldnt stop. Now I dont do well with people touching me at random, surprising noises, loud bangs, sirens and fire alarms)   \n\nIt was like I was looking at a connect the dots, and the dots were all in a straight line in numerical order. I got deeply confused. Why hadn't I ever talked to my psychiatrists about this? Why didn't I realize I have flashbacks weekly or more? Why didn't I realize hearing aggressive shouting is very prone to do this, even from strangers in public, or in film/tv? Why didn't I realize my reaction to the memory or presence of my moms abuser far exceeds what is normal? Why did I not connect my hatred of his face, Heineken, the smell of spilled beer, or his cologne with this? How did I never admit this? Any of this? Why did I always deny I had trauma issues or dodge the question so deftly, all the while completely unconscious of what I was dodging? What the fuck do I do now? \n\nI feel like I wasn't hurt badly enough. I wasn't the direct target of any of his violence until I was an adult. It wasn't sexual or combat related. It didn't ruin my life(depression did that for me) like my friend, who I knew disassociates for hours and wakes up multiple times nightly from the nightmares. I feel guilty for even considering it, but I detect too many characteristics that line up for me to ignore it. I'm making an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I've been seeing psychiatrists for 9 years by now and I've never done this. \n\nMy sense of self and my understanding of my mental health has been destroyed. I feel like I was assembling a jigsaw puzzle of myself, was mostly done, and perhaps 40% of the puzzle just got torn off, mixed up, and the pieces thrown across the floor. I've always felt that if nothing else, I knew what happens to my brain. I thought it has been the same for years now. That there wasn't more to discover, just need to work more therapy and cope better. But there's been a giant red neon sign saying \"THESE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS YOU DOLT\" here the whole time and I've been blind to it. What else could I have missed? How deep does this trauma stuff run? How am I supposed to self evaluate when I can apparently never be objective about these things? What use is talking about ones symptoms if I managed to perfectly lie to myself and to my doctors and therapists for all of these years?\n\nIt's so plainly obvious, I think I must have subconsciously been refusing to accept it. To protect.. something. That's why I think I was able to take off the blinders about this when I was uninhibited through the drugs I took to calm down. Its my only thought I've managed to come up with regarding why I never saw the plainly obvious truth, and instead unconsciously denied and avoided, with expert skill, connecting the symptoms to trauma. Even the flashbacks. I always just thought I was being dramatic and emotional. I never had a thought about them beyond \"oh just ignore it\". Even though I knew what PTSD commonly presents as. Even though I didn't think I was hiding anything or that I would hide anything like this. \n\nI'm talking to my psychiatrist soon. I don't look forward to it at all. I have a feeling it will be awful trying to say any of this. I don't even know what's next. I am not able to reduce my exposure to my triggers. I can't control him. My mom thinks I should like him and has never understood how upset I get. Even when I (of all people, never hurt a fly, never wanted to fight anyone, ever) have been so upset by his presence, combined with hearing his inescapable voice in my bedroom, that I attacked him. Two different times. I can't even type this post without crying from this. Talking. Ugh. :(\n\nSorry for this huge wall of text. I'm just. My brain feels like scrambled eggs. So many questions. Feel so lost about who/what I am as a person and what my mental illness means and how they affect me. It's seemingly all gone out the window and I'm put back at the start.

I hid this from my parents.\n\n\nFainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I\u2019m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children\u2019s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)\n\n\nInsomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn\u2019t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. \n\n\nVivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it\u2019s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. \n\n\nSocial Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn\u2019t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)\n\n\nDepression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I\u2019m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn\u2019t make me sad or upset, it\u2019s not like I wanted those things because I don\u2019t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn\u2019t close to my dad but wasn\u2019t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn\u2019t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn\u2019t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)\n\n\nIrregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I\u2019m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)\n\n\nConcentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) \n\n\nA few other things I experienced but I don\u2019t feel like going into:\nEating disorders\nAlcohol and drug abuse \nPromiscuity \n\n\nAll of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I\u2019m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. \n\n\nJust now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years.

{"id": "1859_counseling", "displayed_text": "I've been with my husband for eight years now.  We have split twice before, and the first time was because he cheated.  I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes.  However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust.  My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again.  During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with.  But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child. \n   The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her.  He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away).  He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too.  He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since.  Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can\u2019t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual.  Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time.  He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything.  He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time.  He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him.  He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life. \n   I'm of course hurt and in shock.
