However, in the past two years, I think I've pinpointed that my emotional issues stem from a specific incidence of trauma from when I was a kid, but I'm doubting if this memory was actually 'traumatic enough'. \n\nWhen I was around 7 years old, I had a pet parakeet. My older brother, around 14 at the time, offered me a quarter if he could have my her. In my mind, since we lived in the same house, he could have the bird but she would still be here in the house, so it didnt matter. I don't remember much of the events that happened after that moment, but I remember that he had had a friend over and they were joking around. Anyways, we had the kind of glass windows that shut closed. At some point, my brother put the bird in the windowsill and smashed the glass slider against her, basically killing her violently. \n\nI believe I suppressed this memory, or blocked out most of it, since I don't remember much of what happened afterwards. \n\nI'm making this post because I have told only one person in my life about this situation, and while she is incredibly supportive and helpful with my emotional issues, I still feel in the back of my mind that this /isn't/ PTSD, and my issues don't stem from this experience at all. \n\nFor the entirety of my life, I have felt an extreme, often paranoid fear of people close to me hurting me physically or even killing me. I am currently seeing a wonderful guy, but I feel like I have PTSD glasses on and am searching obsessively for signs that he's a sociopath. This obsessive fear, of someone close to me turning out to be a sociopath/someone who will violently hurt me, has been a ever present theme in my life, and I am wondering if this worry is directly caused by the experience with the bird, or if it's coming from something else.

That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  \n\nI hid it from the court, because it\u2019s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.\n\nAfter a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.\n\nIn my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.\n\n10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to \u201cjust climb out\u201d.  That fucking pit...\n\nTold the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I\u2019d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. \n\nThankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t want to deal with these people around me who didn\u2019t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn\u2019t want them to feel like me.  It\u2019s one of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you\u2019re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.\n\nTo avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It\u2019s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.\n\nWhat used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I\u2019ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven\u2019t done that since 06\u2019. \n\nAm I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That\u2019s still there right now.  But I\u2019m up.  \n\nI\u2019m doing choirs.  I\u2019m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.

I was assaulted as a child, by my cousin, then again at 11 by my boyfriendwho was 16, and again at 14 by a different boyfriend. I never told anyone, even my therapists, I was \"normal\" in my eyes, because until two years ago some of the incidents never resonated as an assault. I was conditioned to think they were normal things that teen girls do with or for the older men in their lives. My therapist knew though, I think. They're trained to know, especially when a young kid is edging around certain subjects like their love life or past boyfriends.\n\nWell, a friend who knew me and my first boyfriend (the one who assaulted me at 11), has recently started hanging out with him again after years of no connection. He's apparently VERY different now, but she doesn't know that he assaulted me. She keeps pressuring me into going to their friend's house to hang out, she keeps texting me funny things he's said to her, and I woke up early this morning read a text from her about him and fell back asleep because it was early. \n\nI had a TERRIBLE nightmare, I woke up and didnt even remember where I was. I won't go into details, but it SEVERELY affected me. I dont know what I want to do, I want to run away and stay put. I want to cry and I want to brush it off. I dont know what to do, because i never played into the PTSD. I didnt want my siblings or parents to know, i didnt want anyone to know. I never told anyone about that diagnosis and now?

{"id": "1177_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Introductory post..kinda?//about my PTSD Hi guys. I\u2019m new to this sub reddit.\n\n\nI\u2019m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. \nI totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn\u2019t do anything. \nI had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn\u2019t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don\u2019t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.\nI\u2019m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can\u2019t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can\u2019t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. \nI also watched the worst accident I\u2019ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I\u2019d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn\u2019t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn\u2019t ok to drive. \nSo.. yea. I don\u2019t really know where I was going with this, I guess I\u2019m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they\u2019re doing better now. \nI don\u2019t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can\u2019t even do those things.\nI\u2019m trying so hard. I just feel like it\u2019s pointless sometimes. \n\nAnyway if you read this super long post..\nThank you.

This happened about 4-5 years ago and she sill has trust issues and emotional issues because of it. I am new to relationships, I've only had one long term relationship before this for two years and it ended abruptly and suddenly. Because of that I also am insecure with relationships and I was not sure if she actually liked me for a while. She does but she has a hard time showing it, and I've accepted that because I really like her. She has a hard time expressing herself to me which is fine but a little frustrating because I don't have much of a filter and I say what I feel to her.\n\nShe refuses to get help. She won't see a therapist and she won't take medication because she doesn't want to depend on it her whole life. She saw a therapist initially but it made the anxiety and depression worse leading to a suicide attempt, so she won't try again. I keep telling her she needs to talk to someone if not me, or try meds but she won't budge. \n\nAlso, occasionally she will get very defensive with me about seemingly very random things, which does tend to lead to fights because it makes me upset and then she gets upset because of that. What should I do when this happens? She also never apologizes for doing it, which is also a little frustrating because it makes me feel bad, like I did something to upset her(enter, insecurity). \n\n All of this being said, I have a few questions.\n\nHow do I help her get help? What can I do?\n\nWill she ever open up to me? I see glimpses of her true self every now and then but I want to know everything about her, and it's frustrating that I can't.\n\nIf anyone would like to share experiences of dating someone with ptsd I'd love to hear them.

I have a great deal of trauma attached to my birth name which I no longer use and they put very little effort into understanding this and not using it when talking to or about me. I also have trauma associated with my upbringing and my family's behaviour to me as a child.\n\nThe conversations were over email and it felt as if they had begun to be more understanding of this. Recently my Mother came to visit me and after about an hour into her being here, I noticed I had begun to feel extremely nauseous, very anxious and uncomfortable, to the point where I really struggled to focus and maintain socialising for the rest of the day and for the rest of her visit. I had a really hard time falling asleep because these feelings did not subside and instead had gotten worse, leaving me up overthinking to the point of crying and feeling like I needed to throw up as if I had something stuck in my throat.\n\nEven though they have not purposefully me any wrongdoing and that I still love them as family, I feel as if I would be putting myself through more than it is worth and more than I can deal with if I continued keeping in contact with them.
