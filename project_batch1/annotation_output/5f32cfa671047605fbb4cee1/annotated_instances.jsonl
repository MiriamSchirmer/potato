{"id": "909_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I was really triggered the other day and now I've been having anxiety attacks for no reason I was at a friend's place until really late the other night, like 4am, for a birthday. I called an uber and forgot to check that I didn't want to walk, so even though her neighborhood is really nice I ended up having to walk and wait on this semi sketchy big road\n\nUber is taking longer than expected and a man yells over that he wants to talk to me, I shake my head and he presses but I wave him off and he went away briefly. \n\nA few minutes pass, my uber hasn't moved (it's waiting on another pickup) and I hear the guy yell \"Miss! Miss!\" I ignore him but he starts coming to me and I get scared. He starts calling me beautiful and says he'll call me a cab and I say I have one coming and I start to call my friend because I feel like hey my chances of being murdered lessen if I'm on the phone.\n\nHe starts pleading with me to talk to him and saying he loves me and reaches his hand out and asks me to take it and I say no ans he just keeps inching closer to try and touch me. I say no again,  I'm on the phone with my friend but I don't want to talk about this guy while he's right there.\n\nThis guy starts accusing me of thinking he's dirty, and continues insisting I touch him. My uber finally comes and I cry in the car to my friend until I'm okay to hang up.\n\nAt work yesterday I thought I was okay but then I just kept having random breakdowns throughout the day. I don't have any meds for it and it's making it hard to function.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1106, "end": 1118, "span": "hone with my", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 42s "}}
