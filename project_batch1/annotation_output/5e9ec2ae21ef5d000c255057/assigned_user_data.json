I went to slow down and my body just went completely lifeless, my vision went blurry and was almost as if I was in a Minecraft game (weird I know)\n\nMy second car accident was in August 2017, a year and 4 months AFTER my first accident. I got t-boned on the driver side in a parking lot. I was stopped had my blinker on waiting for him to go by so I can turn left and the man who hit me didn\u2019t have his blinker on but I saw he was turning right. Well he turned right as I barely began to turn left and he came completely in my lane t-boning me. \n\nThen my last most recent accident happened January 2018. I was driving my Ex\u2019s lifted F-250 truck, it was our moving weekend and he worked out of town at the time so he was driving his commuter and I was driving the truck. Well it was raining and we were taking the back roads that lead to the main hwy. Well we were coming up the hill with a slight curve and the speed limit is 45 mph and I was going about 35 mph maybe 40 mph due to it raining and I barely put pressure on the gas during the curve and the bed of the truck starts hydroplane fishtailing.. everything starts going slow motion and the front passenger tire hits a curb and the truck flipped and rolled  5-6 times about 70ft down a steep hill that dropped off into a river. I instantly thought I was going to die in that car accident. \n\nWith those being the accidents I\u2019ve been in I\u2019m absolutely 1,000% terrified to drive on highways, drive in the rain, drive long distance. When I drive on the hwy I constantly feel as if I\u2019m hydroplane fishtailing. I start to lose my breathing, my body goes numb. I absolutely REFUSE to drive in the rain unless I\u2019m in my hometown and not on the 2 main highways. I hate driving long distance because I get a really bad rush of anxiety and feel like something bad is going to happen if I\u2019m driving. \n\nSorry for the long post. I\u2019ve tried all the grounding techniques, having lavender scented air fresheners/ essential oil in my car, talking to myself and telling myself I\u2019m okay. Does anyone else have this problem? Will I eventually get over my fears and overcome my ptsd? Any tips and advice to help get rid of it? TIA", "displayed_text": "Advice to help with car accident ptsd I (19F) have been in 3 car accidents since I got my drivers license when I was 16.. the first one in April 2016, 3 months after I got my license, I rear ended a stopped car at a red light stop going 35 mph. I went to slow down and my body just went completely lifeless, my vision went blurry and was almost as if I was in a Minecraft game (weird I know)\n\nMy second car accident was in August 2017, a year and 4 months AFTER my first accident. I got t-boned on the driver side in a parking lot. I was stopped had my blinker on waiting for him to go by so I can turn left and the man who hit me didn\u2019t have his blinker on but I saw he was turning right. Well he turned right as I barely began to turn left and he came completely in my lane t-boning me. \n\nThen my last most recent accident happened January 2018. I was driving my Ex\u2019s lifted F-250 truck, it was our moving weekend and he worked out of town at the time so he was driving his commuter and I was driving the truck. Well it was raining and we were taking the back roads that lead to the main hwy. Well we were coming up the hill with a slight curve and the speed limit is 45 mph and I was going about 35 mph maybe 40 mph due to it raining and I barely put pressure on the gas during the curve and the bed of the truck starts hydroplane fishtailing.. everything starts going slow motion and the front passenger tire hits a curb and the truck flipped and rolled  5-6 times about 70ft down a steep hill that dropped off into a river. I instantly thought I was going to die in that car accident. \n\nWith those being the accidents I\u2019ve been in I\u2019m absolutely 1,000% terrified to drive on highways, drive in the rain, drive long distance. When I drive on the hwy I constantly feel as if I\u2019m hydroplane fishtailing. I start to lose my breathing, my body goes numb. I absolutely REFUSE to drive in the rain unless I\u2019m in my hometown and not on the 2 main highways. I hate driving long distance because I get a really bad rush of anxiety and feel like something bad is going to happen if I\u2019m driving. \n\nSorry for the long post.

What do I do? (19 y/o male) About 2 months ago one night  I was delivering a pizza to an apartment building for my job. I left my car door unlocked for convenience when i just walked like 30 steps to the door to deliver it. A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. \nSince then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could\u2019ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I\u2019ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could\u2019ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I\u2019ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don\u2019t really have nightmares.\nI just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it\u2019s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I\u2019ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don\u2019t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I\u2019ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I\u2019ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I\u2019m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I\u2019ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I\u2019m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn\u2019t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn\u2019t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he\u2019s made it clear before that he doesn\u2019t generally prescribe benzodiazepines. What are my options? I desperately need advice. Sorry for the long and badly structured rant by the way.", "displayed_text": "Is this PTSD? What do I do?
