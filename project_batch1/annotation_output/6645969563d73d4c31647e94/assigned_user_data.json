This is a bit of a rant and probably horribly structured \n\nI watched the movie honey boy and the similarities broke down the memory wall I built. My mental health had hit critical about two years ago, I was diagnosed with complex ptsd with suicidal ideation, which I had known for awhile it was most likely that. I started going to therapy, I quit drinking and doing drugs, started medication again, things have been getting better slowly. Now the wall is down, memories and emotions started flooding in, flashbacks started again, suicidal ideation started more frequently ( I will never go through with it) and for the life of me I can't seem to understand how bad my situation was growing up, I know it was wrong and not normal but something is blocking me from viewing it rationally. It was just my life, I have no other perspective or anything I can compare it to.  I'm more writing this out to just to get it out so... Here we go\n\nMy first memory of my father was when I was 2 to 4, my mom was leaving for work, he was hungover I'm assuming and I was crying staring out the window because she was leaving me, I didn't stop after she left, I remember my dad had his hand on his face not looking well, barley attempting to calm me down when he grabbed my pj shirt and slapped me across the face, the memory ends there. Typically he would use a belt or a metal shoe horn, he didn't get more physical until I was older but that is maybe my first memory of my childhood that comes to mind. Everything is fuzzy but that one is clear as day. I would run away from him when I would get in trouble and he would chase me around the house snapping his leather belt over and over until he caught me and would then beat me bare ass with it, I can't remember the pain or even being hit with the belt, I just remember the before it happened.

This is a bit of a rant and probably horribly structured \n\nI watched the movie honey boy and the similarities broke down the memory wall I built. My mental health had hit critical about two years ago, I was diagnosed with complex ptsd with suicidal ideation, which I had known for awhile it was most likely that. I started going to therapy, I quit drinking and doing drugs, started medication again, things have been getting better slowly. Now the wall is down, memories and emotions started flooding in, flashbacks started again, suicidal ideation started more frequently ( I will never go through with it) and for the life of me I can't seem to understand how bad my situation was growing up, I know it was wrong and not normal but something is blocking me from viewing it rationally.

A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn\u2019t stand with out pain.\nFor the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I\u2019d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn\u2019t go in I\u2019d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn\u2019t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.\nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd.

The memory that TRULY haunts me during this period of my life is from a particular babysitter's home. We (4-5 other kids) were left alone all the time in the babysitter's basement. There was another child who was 2 or 3 that they looked after, and he fatally abused several of the babysitter's pets while we were left alone. I was 5 or 6 and could do  nothing but watch. I blocked it out until I was 10 and owned a pet - that's when I'd say it truly began to haunt me.

DAILY. It feels like I'm there. For a split second I hear things, I feel things, I see everything, it takes over my vision, my bones, my guts, I feel physically and emotionally for the animals. I gasp, I plug my ears, I cry, I panic. At home alone or in public, on the bus, at work. And it loops like my other intrusive thoughts. I think about it once and it takes minutes or hours to cool off. When things IRL remind me of it (area carpets, certain animals, roadkill, certain gestures), it's like I'm FORCED to think about it again. I'm freaking my husband out with it lately, I know. I had to open up to him about it recently because it flaired up a few weeks ago and I was crying in bed and it was torture because it is so incredibly difficult to talk about it. \n\nSubconsciously I know a lot of my current issues are because I was left alone with strangers so much as a child and I kept a lot of went on from my mom when I could. Compared to other people's stories I feel ashamed posting here looking for direction, and as badly as I'd like to talk to my therapist about this, I don't know if it's worth it. It's not like she can do anything about the memory itself, right? It's not like my other intrusive thoughts that are purely fictional. This is something that happened and nothing can change it.

There was another child who was 2 or 3 that they looked after, and he fatally abused several of the babysitter's pets while we were left alone. I was 5 or 6 and could do  nothing but watch. I blocked it out until I was 10 and owned a pet - that's when I'd say it truly began to haunt me. I didn't tell my mother until a few weeks ago, and I was even more vague talking about it than I'm being here.!&lt;\n\nI pushed this event aside as an intrusive thought and told myself it was nothing more, but it HAUNTS me. DAILY. It feels like I'm there. For a split second I hear things, I feel things, I see everything, it takes over my vision, my bones, my guts, I feel physically and emotionally for the animals. I gasp, I plug my ears, I cry, I panic. At home alone or in public, on the bus, at work. And it loops like my other intrusive thoughts. I think about it once and it takes minutes or hours to cool off. When things IRL remind me of it (area carpets, certain animals, roadkill, certain gestures), it's like I'm FORCED to think about it again. I'm freaking my husband out with it lately, I know. I had to open up to him about it recently because it flaired up a few weeks ago and I was crying in bed and it was torture because it is so incredibly difficult to talk about it. \n\nSubconsciously I know a lot of my current issues are because I was left alone with strangers so much as a child and I kept a lot of went on from my mom when I could. Compared to other people's stories I feel ashamed posting here looking for direction, and as badly as I'd like to talk to my therapist about this, I don't know if it's worth it. It's not like she can do anything about the memory itself, right? It's not like my other intrusive thoughts that are purely fictional. This is something that happened and nothing can change it. But I can't handle this plaguing me anymore. \n\nI want help and I have no idea if THIS is even the best place to start. \n\nI appreciate any advice. Thanks so much if you read the whole thing and hope it's okay to post this."}, "964_counseling": {"id": "964_counseling", "text": "Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him.
