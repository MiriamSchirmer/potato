I've recently come home from the Air Force and have been going to the VA for a couple of months for generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder. I also struggled heavily with [possible trigger warning!](#s \"suicidal thoughts.\") Recently my therapist diagnosed me with OCD and PTSD which has been an eye opener, seeing as to how I've been feeling like something else was up with me, but couldn't figure out what it was until she confirmed it for me. \n\nSince I've been home my wife and I have gotten married and moved into our first home together (we stayed with her parents for the first two months of me coming home). I had a job at a residential care facility, but I quit and decided to work on my health full time until I could handle this stuff better because it was a real struggle working and coping at the same time. But since I quit, it meant it was fully up to my wife to pay the bills and rent. We're managing (barely), but I feel selfish and I want to help. I've gotten better since the start of my treatment and I want to get back into the world to fully turn back to civilian life and learn more about how to live with what I have by getting more used to it. \n\nI looked into being a baker as a job. I feel comfortable working with food and cooking at home. It really helps me take my mind off of my struggles and put them into what I'm doing. Plus baking to me is relaxing and not to difficult of a job. I've found a bakery here where I live and have been thinking about contacting the owner about my situation and applying, but I'm unsure if that's the right way to go about it. I want to the owner to be understanding of my situation though and know what they're getting into hiring me.

I've recently come home from the Air Force and have been going to the VA for a couple of months for generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder. I also struggled heavily with [possible trigger warning!](#s \"suicidal thoughts.\") Recently my therapist diagnosed me with OCD and PTSD which has been an eye opener, seeing as to how I've been feeling like something else was up with me, but couldn't figure out what it was until she confirmed it for me. \n\nSince I've been home my wife and I have gotten married and moved into our first home together (we stayed with her parents for the first two months of me coming home). I had a job at a residential care facility, but I quit and decided to work on my health full time until I could handle this stuff better because it was a real struggle working and coping at the same time. But since I quit, it meant it was fully up to my wife to pay the bills and rent. We're managing (barely), but I feel selfish and I want to help. I've gotten better since the start of my treatment and I want to get back into the world to fully turn back to civilian life and learn more about how to live with what I have by getting more used to it. \n\nI looked into being a baker as a job. I feel comfortable working with food and cooking at home. It really helps me take my mind off of my struggles and put them into what I'm doing. Plus baking to me is relaxing and not to difficult of a job.

I\u2019ve been burnt with hot objects, forced to take drugs and tortured in various other ways. \nAll of which happened so I could continue to be raped and used as a sex object. \nAnd of course the abuse didn\u2019t stop there it went on for years, leaked into every part of my life and flourished like an infestation of evil. \nHooray for my childhood.\n\nSomehow this made me hyper vigilant and unable to trust anyone or too trusting which got me in even more irreversible trouble. \n\nIt\u2019s as if I\u2019m a wounded animal in a pack that is continuously targeted by others preying on the weak. \n\nI remember being punished for my resulting apparent cowardice by being beaten up and spit on and various other corrective measures by kids in my neighborhood. \n\nSo I decided to no longer be vulnerable when I was about 9 years old. I decided I\u2019d be how people apparently wanted me to be:  \nDisconnected from myself an my feelings and violent to anyone who tries to come close or even annoyed me. \n\nI haven\u2019t healed. I\u2019m still fighting fear on a daily basis. So I\u2019m never at ease and everything is hard and painful. Even concentrating and understanding what other people say gives me a lot of anxiety.\n\nBecause of this anxiety I will probably not react to this post anymore until everyone has forgotten about it. \n\nI\u2019m sure other people pick up on my fear. \nI feel I\u2019m still being judged for being afraid. \nAfraid of things the people that judge me have never dealt with and never will. They will never have to look back on a childhood full of violence and abuse but they will judge me just the same. \n\nBut I wonder how many people notice my fear and insecurities and just use it against me. \nI feel that a lot of people do because everyone is afraid to a certain degree and putting someone down is just a way for some to keep their illusion of power. \n\nHow can I know the difference between someone I can trust and someone I should stay away from?\n\nHow will I know if they don\u2019t have a hidden agenda?\n\nI know that I have trust issues because of how I was treated for as long as I can remember but how can I ever trust anyone again?\n\nI wish I could trust people but I don\u2019t.\n"}, "2192_ptsd": {"id": "2192_ptsd", "text": "Good days and bad days and chronic fatigue I have a hard time letting myself accept the diagnosis of PTSD because I've always heard the, 'other people have it worse than you' in response to my trauma.
