{"id": "2469_ptsd", "displayed_text": "The Only Way Out is Through: Using Virtual Reality for PTSD in Veterans  In 1997, virtual reality, then a newly developed technology, was hypothesized to be an effective method of delivering exposure therapy. In virtual reality exposure therapy, the person is immersed in a computer-created virtual environment. While initially developed for advanced game play, it was quickly realized that the technology could also be used therapeutically.  The first study with ten veterans demonstrated that this therapy was effective in symptom improvement in all participants. This success was considered so significant that after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York\u2019s World Trade Center, burn victims suffering from PTSD were treated using virtual reality exposure techniques. The outcomes for this treatment situation was also extremely successful. \n\nTo date, virtual reality exposure therapy for PTSD has primarily been used with Vietnam War veterans so the virtual setting includes such imagery as helicopters and jungles. Research has shown that this type of therapy helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in these veterans. A few subsequent studies conducted with small numbers of Iraq and Afghanistan War vets found that virtual reality based therapy was also helpful in reducing symptoms in these former soldiers. \n\n[This article](https://medium.com/swlh/the-only-way-out-is-through-using-virtual-reality-for-ptsd-in-veterans-a0a3a0b1b3db?source=friends_link&amp;sk=67afc5dbc04e6a71afec35e744d68eb1) discussed an amazing personal experience working on an inpatient PTSD unit at the VA Hospital in New Orleans.

I've recently come home from the Air Force and have been going to the VA for a couple of months for generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder. I also struggled heavily with [possible trigger warning!](#s \"suicidal thoughts.\") Recently my therapist diagnosed me with OCD and PTSD which has been an eye opener, seeing as to how I've been feeling like something else was up with me, but couldn't figure out what it was until she confirmed it for me. \n\nSince I've been home my wife and I have gotten married and moved into our first home together (we stayed with her parents for the first two months of me coming home). I had a job at a residential care facility, but I quit and decided to work on my health full time until I could handle this stuff better because it was a real struggle working and coping at the same time. But since I quit, it meant it was fully up to my wife to pay the bills and rent. We're managing (barely), but I feel selfish and I want to help. I've gotten better since the start of my treatment and I want to get back into the world to fully turn back to civilian life and learn more about how to live with what I have by getting more used to it. \n\nI looked into being a baker as a job. I feel comfortable working with food and cooking at home. It really helps me take my mind off of my struggles and put them into what I'm doing. Plus baking to me is relaxing and not to difficult of a job. I've found a bakery here where I live and have been thinking about contacting the owner about my situation and applying, but I'm unsure if that's the right way to go about it. I want to the owner to be understanding of my situation though and know what they're getting into hiring me. Not that I'm going to be a nuisance and have a lot of problems, but that I may need a break or two every once and awhile to collect my thoughts and catch my breathe, you know? \n\nI'm also going to talk to my therapist about this on Thursday during our next appointment, but until then I wanted to get this subreddits thoughts on it and if it sounds like a good idea, or if I should even go for it?

I never really considered the possibility that I might have PTSD until very recently. I'm currently 31...when I was 19, I entered into my first real relationship. It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much. The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.\n\nAfter, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be \"getting him excited\" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong... Basically, it was my fault. I lived with guilt, shame, and just overall disgust for a really long time. \n\nEver since then, I have not been the same person. I lost trust in people....I can't enjoy sex....I'm afraid to date and fall in love....I'm afraid of men touching me.... I just avoid relationships and love all together. \n\nAnd that was just the first relationship. I don't even want to get into the second relationship, but he sexually violated me too. He purposely tampered with a condom to get me pregnant to keep me from transferring away to college. He thought that I'd decide to keep his baby and stay local with him. I aborted it and moved away of course. That was when I was maybe 22 or 23. That was the last relationship. I've been avoiding dating because I'm afraid of history repeating itself.
