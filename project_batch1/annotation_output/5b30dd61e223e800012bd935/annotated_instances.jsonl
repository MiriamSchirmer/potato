{"id": "2176_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Emotional abuse during marriage I\u2019ve been divorced now for three years. I was married for five to a man who was emotionally abusive, and I caught him cheating on me three different times, with men and women, using the internet. Each time it happened it was like hell breaking loose inside of me. Once was bad enough, then two more times on top of it. The most damning part was he pretended to care about our family and about me and presented this image to the world as the greatest guy and everyone loved him but behind my back and everyone\u2019s back he did these horrible things like he was two people. I once caught him on social media impersonating a high school girl trying to get pictures but he destroyed the evidence before I could call the police. \n\nNow I am in a relationship with a man who is actually a good man but it\u2019s like I can\u2019t shut this part of my brain off that associates social media, technology, things of this nature, where my boyfriend is concerned, as perceived threats. When I don\u2019t manage myself manually through the use of CBT and DBT from therapy, my brain is on autopilot in hypervigilance....anything associated with social media (which is how I found him three times) it\u2019s like at certain times usually when I\u2019m ill or tired or stressed it\u2019s like I feel this vein of anxiety open up in me and out it comes...all the feelings that I felt that night, the other night, the night after, of the horror and despair of seeing him doing awful things behind my back. And I have to scan and stalk and research deeply into my boyfriend\u2019s social media to try to quiet this desperation that\u2019s roaring inside of me to find anything. It\u2019s like I wish I could say I did it to self-sooth but the truth is really I do it to self-protect. If I go searching for it and find it, then it won\u2019t hurt as bad. If I mistrust ahead of time and I make a discovery then I beat the terror and despair. The vein of anxiety only gets worse. And suddenly I see things that aren\u2019t even there. A liked photo of a female must represent....so much. And I\u2019ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can\u2019t breathe I\u2019m shaking I\u2019m numb. And he is there just reminding me, gently... this isn\u2019t happening right now. This is your past, this isn\u2019t our present. I\u2019ve never lied to you. I\u2019ve always kept my promises to you. I love you. \n\nAnd it is true. I\u2019m so ashamed of what my brain does when a trigger happens. The feelings emotional and physical all come back. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a nightmare but I\u2019m awake. I\u2019m fighting ghosts of the past and metaphorically swinging at the man who loves me, trying to hit my ex husband (metaphorically). \n\nI\u2019ve been working on this, been using my skills, and I\u2019m not as reactive as I used to be. I can know what is and isn\u2019t real like I can step out of the experience.  I can quietly articulate what I\u2019m feeling. I can peacefully communicate my way through it with my boyfriend.\n\nBut the behavior of feeling the trigger, feeling the vein open, and feeling like I did the nights I first saw something suspicious and then going right into the compulsive activities of searching, searching, searching, searching, like I did after all the times, until in the past I found what would destroy me three times over and over and in the present where I\u2019m finding nothing but yet making something out of it anyway, as if I\u2019m on autopilot as if I\u2019m awake in a nightmare as if  I\u2019m reliving it all over again, and yet as if my brain is doing all this so I can \u201cconquer\u201d this thing.

Hi guys, I don\u2019t know who else to ask.\n\nI won\u2019t go into tons of details about what happened with me, but someone very very close to me almost died, nearly a year ago now. It was a very stressful situation and I was critical in saving their life, and I was very close to the situation as it developed (if you need more elaboration I can try).\n\nAfterwards I didn\u2019t immediately go to therapy; it was at least a couple months.

I had, and still have, in some areas, pretty sever anxiety with things related to the event (such as ambulances, sirens, hospitals, etc, along with more specific situational things) and I couldn\u2019t drive for a while because I\u2019d have to pull over quite often to calm myself down.\n\nI didn\u2019t mention PTSD in the post, but in the comments someone said that it sounded like PTSD.

{"id": "1625_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Traumatic experience (potential trigger warning) \\[Trigger warning: confrontation, potential abuse, self-harm\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to \"listen to her point of view because she had listened to me.\" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our \"conversation.\" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.\n\nAt some point in this \"conversation\" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say \"No\" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said \"nice talking to you guys.\" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.\n\nIn the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way \"there\".  \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole \"me\" in ways I have never experienced before.

I post here while crying my face off alone in my bedroom trying to cry quietly so no one hears me. \n\nI close my eyes after sitting for twenty minutes saying to myself that I can't think of those things over and over. The moment my eyes shut I see a few scenes from my childhood. One of which surfaced after not showing it's face for quite a few years. I sat up horrified and had to refrain from screaming. I thought I had forgotten it after all this time. Nope. Of course not. I never forget that shit. \n\nBehind my eyelids I saw my brother digging up something fuzzy and lumpy from the ground in the forest right by my grandmother's house.\n I feel sick just typing this but here it goes. On the shovel there were bones and a larger lump came up and I saw the fur of an animal. I was an extremely gullible child who had followed my brother and it took me till seeing the fur to realize this is where we had buried our cat Smokey.

These are people who knew what was going on, the pain I was in and still in and are seriously responding with things like \"glad things are going good for you\".\n\nI am accustomed to not being heard when I speak, cry or beg for mercy... why was I such a fool to tell these people I am still suffering? Why did I try for help? Why did I think they cared? Is my brain so muddled that I convinced myself I mattered to these people? \n\nAnd last but not least... why do people honestly wonder why I don't leave the house or interact with people IRL?\n\nTLDR..

I (26f) don\u2019t want to go into a lot of detail because I\u2019m still processing everything. I had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. Last Wednesday I drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. They took me to the nearest hospital where I actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me. I\u2019ve literally lost count of how many attempts I\u2019ve made, but I know it\u2019s in the 20 range. Most of them occurred in a 3 month period about 5 years ago, but my first attempt was at 13. My therapist (who I switched to about 6 months ago as my last therapist was useless) told me very bluntly that if I don\u2019t get my shit together that I will die by my own hand before I die of old age. She said people like me often don\u2019t make it. She also said my parents expect that I will die from suicide. It shook me to my core. It was my first attempt in over 4 years and it was different than the others. This attempt terrified me. I don\u2019t remember much of it. It\u2019s like a few days later I woke up from horrible nightmare thinking what the fuck have I done. I don\u2019t want to die. I don\u2019t want my ex to have this much control over me years after I broke up with him. Has anyone told you anything similar? How did you cope? Maybe if I just hide in bed the rest of my life I\u2019ll live to be 80. She said I can do it, but I need to realize the harsh truth of the matter that I have already beat the odds too many times. I feel unfixable. Will I be broken forever? Will I live until I\u2019m 80? I really hope so, but now I\u2019m not so sure.

I think I may have PTSD, at least, I appear to meet the DSM 5 criteria for it. The thing is that even the thought of PTSD had never popped into my head before a couple nights ago.\n\nI was watching a cop drama where the main character had to go to a therapist for an evaluation. All of a sudden, BAM, that sounds a lot like me.\n\nSo here\u2019s my story.\n\nLast year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed. I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can\u2019t and even if I could I probably wouldn\u2019t share). Unfortunately, she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn\u2019t save her. I had to relay all this whilst it was happening to my dad and my brother who were back in our home country. \n\nThey were able to come out the next day luckily but I was alone all night.\n\nEver since then I\u2019ve thought that I was just grieving normally for my mother. I do go to a therapist about it once a week. Whenever I talk to people about what happened they always say \u201cit must have been so traumatic\u201d but I myself have never used that word to describe it, not even in my own thoughts.\n\nNow though, I can\u2019t stop thinking that this may actually be affecting me. Actually, I knew how badly I was being affected but I just thought that it was part of the grieving process. I called a friend tonight and told her what I was thinking and she told me that she\u2019s suspected it for months! She didn\u2019t know how to tell me what she thought. I\u2019m not mad or upset at her or anything but I am a bit shocked that someone could come to that conclusion so long before I even thought about it! \n\nI\u2019m not self diagnosing but I would like to know for certain if it is PTSD or not. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and am planning to ask her.\n\nDid any of you have this BAM realisation?

I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re so comfortable with who you share your life with, I\u2019m sorry I allowed that. I\u2019ve been carrying guilt for years that I granted him the freedom to do this to another individual, and that I was so scared to open up about what occurred four years ago. \n\nYou\u2019re going to find out soon, and you\u2019re not going to believe it at first. You\u2019re going to be told bluntly, and you will reject it. Perhaps you\u2019ve already been told, by his friends that are no longer his friends for a reason that you should know by now. I couldn\u2019t comprehend it either, not at first. I didn\u2019t understand what information I had just been handed, what it meant and what it was doing to me. Four years later I am still processing what it was and who he is. It still weighs on me as heavy as it did that night, but in a different way.\n\nI mourned my relationship first, I had succumbed to what I thought was love, but was ultimately masterful manipulation. He made it easy to attach myself to him with promises of an appealing future. He had a way of convincing me he was smarter than me, and everyone else. You\u2019ll be okay if you stick with me, the rest of the world is toxic and confused. We\u2019re okay if we just stay here. I love you because you\u2019re practical, you\u2019re not like any other girl I\u2019ve dated. They\u2019re all crazy, you\u2019re sane. You\u2019re grounded, and you pay half of the rent. \n\nHe was secretive to start, a few early discrepancies regarding other girls online. Inexperienced me deemed this normal, we could moved passed all of that noise - what counted was where we ended up each night. He kept nude images of these girls on his phone, we were not off to a great start. But I was practical, I was different, and I made him feel smart. I existed to embellish him, an important role - and he knew it. I was his type; insecure and accustomed to abuse. This particular trauma, however, is not abuse. Though there was plenty, emotional and physical abuse. I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it. He shoved me into a wall when I announced his lack of masculinity too loudly. \n\nHe worked in security at a ballet school, often overnight. Based on the mistrust that was instilled in me early on in our relationship, the overnight work worried me. Is he talking to girls? Is he sending them unsolicited dick pics? Probably. By this point he had convinced me it was in my head, and I was massively paranoid. I was turning into one of the girls he didn\u2019t want to be around, someone insane and impractical. But I paid rent, and contributed towards the idea of a future. I was being molded into someone who would love him no matter what doubts I had. \n\nHe had some performance issues come up at his job. I can\u2019t remember what they were regarding, or if they were even real\u2026But he lost his full time position. He maintained employment with the same company at a different location, part-time. We got by with savings and my serving job. I got a call one day from his manager, Patrick. They had originally tried to call him, and I was listed as his emergency contact. It was not the first time I had received a call from his work, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I was at work when he called so he left a voicemail - I listened to it on my way home from work. He spoke as if he were talking to him, instructing him to call him back - and that they had to cut into all of the lockers at his previous workplace. He listed off a few of the items found in the lockers and wanted to be sure that they were his, and make sure everything was accounted for. There was a laptop, and a safe box. \n\nI asked him about these items but he assured me they weren\u2019t his. I let it go, as I had many things during our time together. He was picking up a few evening shifts where he could at this time, quite sporadically. He would leave around 2 or 4, and return around 10pm. I got cut from work when the dinner shift showed up, around 4:30. I left work, walked south on Bay Street, east on College, and hopped on the northbound train. I got home around 5:15pm. I unloaded, changed into sweats, the usual. Cleaning was pretty relaxing after a day in the service industry, so I went to grab some supplies under the kitchen sink cupboard. Our kitchen counters were L shaped, and I always thought it was weird that where the space under the cupboard should have ended, it extended passed where the wall above sat. This particular evening I noticed that this was not the case, and somehow the wall had moved forward. I was frightened, I was one of those people that ready creepy stories at night - you know the one where people discover there are people living in small spaces in their home. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wall, it was a piece of bristol board. It was relieving for a brief moment - but that relief was short lived. I removed that board and discovered a safe and a laptop. Since that moment I\u2019ve really repressed what I found - through denial or embarrassment, I\u2019ve somehow forgotten in detail what it was I had seen. I still don\u2019t know what journey I set out to after that moment, but it wasn\u2019t to deal with seeing those images. That was my second mistake. My first was my initial thought - the end of my four year relationship. Logic was not present, logic would have been to immediately call the police - instead of waiting for him to come home to confront him about it.* \n\nIf he somehow sees this - he will frantically come up with something to tell you to convince you I am just some crazy ex-girlfriend out to get me for breaking up with me. Or perhaps he has already set something in place to manipulate you into believing that none of this is truth, and anything anyone ever says apart from him is a lie. When I left Toronto, he covered his tracks - and somehow convinced his family and our mutual friends that I was not to be trusted. He was fine, and merely unhappy in our relationship. He never got the help he claimed to seek, he paused his search for child pornography, but not for long. It\u2019s never for very long. Damaged people don\u2019t get better without proper treatment. \n\nI think about this every fucking day. It\u2019s with me, for better or for worse. I think about the children who attended and lived at the ballet school that he worked at - it\u2019s such a privilege for them to be there, a dream. I think about the children that were trafficked and exploited - contributing to his sick obsession. I think about the women who are trafficked in Southern Ontario. I think about his other ex-girlfriend who also knew about this. I think about his family who are under his false influence. But most of all, I think of you. \n\n(*the crime described in this letter has since been reported.)", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2150, "end": 2394, "span": "I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it.
