I've suffered from PTSD since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 20 now) and diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18. For years, I would have nightmares where I would relive the experience, which seems pretty common. When I got to about 14, I would go about 2 or 3 days without sleeping to avoid these nightmares because I didn't know how to cope with them. When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.\n\nThe dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating. Everything was going as planned until about 20 minutes in. At this point, I was hearing a man speaking aggressively in French (much like Jacques Brel, but the voice sounded deeper). I'm not fluent in French, so whatever I was hearing is a mystery. The next day a similar thing happened after a nightmare except this time it sounded like a low-flying airplane was in my head. It was loud enough to scare me out of meditation and make my heart race. \n\nThe nightmares have been less frequent since then. I have, however, been experiencing more straightforward hallucinations. Every few hours or so, I'll see a humanoid figure in the corner of my eye. Like someone is behind me watching me. More recently I've also been seeing shadow-like figures running around right in front of me. The other night I was in my girlfriend's room watching a show with her when I noticed in the other corner of the room a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye. I couldn't focus on it enough to make out any features, but I did my best to make sure I really saw something. When I finally glanced over, it was gone. She knew something was up, as I seemed distracted (or maybe she sensed my terror) and asked me what was wrong. I just said I thought I saw something. \n\nI'm afraid to come forward about all of this to anyone in my everyday life. I'm afraid people may think there's something wrong with me.

In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.\n\nThe dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating.

Almost nobody around me that's been in less than 6 years has seen anything remotely close to combat, and neither have I. While on a peace time \"deployment\" there was an incident where a few people were drowning, and I stayed back to call the coast guard while my friends went out to help them. One friend ended up being out in 4-8 foot surf with rip tides and sharp coral for an hour and a half, almost 2 hours. I was giving the military police a live update of the situation over the phone and trying to coordinate rescue with the Japanese coast guard. At one point I lost sight of 2 people and thought they had died because I was going too slow. They ended up surviving, one with permanent damage to a few organs. I have these terrible nightmares multiple times a week where if I mess something up, myself or someone else dies. I wake up with really hard reflexes, like a huge jump or a swing, in a cold sweat. I feel super inadequate though. The people around me who have trauma have it from combat, and I have it from being on the phone. I didn't even swim out there. I know it would have been worse if the coast guard hadn't come and everything but I feel guilty about it every single day. This was months ago, and I don't go a single day without feeling guilty either because I didn't go fast enough or because I didn't go out to help.
