{"id": "2469_ptsd", "displayed_text": "The Only Way Out is Through: Using Virtual Reality for PTSD in Veterans  In 1997, virtual reality, then a newly developed technology, was hypothesized to be an effective method of delivering exposure therapy. In virtual reality exposure therapy, the person is immersed in a computer-created virtual environment. While initially developed for advanced game play, it was quickly realized that the technology could also be used therapeutically.  The first study with ten veterans demonstrated that this therapy was effective in symptom improvement in all participants. This success was considered so significant that after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York\u2019s World Trade Center, burn victims suffering from PTSD were treated using virtual reality exposure techniques. The outcomes for this treatment situation was also extremely successful. \n\nTo date, virtual reality exposure therapy for PTSD has primarily been used with Vietnam War veterans so the virtual setting includes such imagery as helicopters and jungles. Research has shown that this type of therapy helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in these veterans. A few subsequent studies conducted with small numbers of Iraq and Afghanistan War vets found that virtual reality based therapy was also helpful in reducing symptoms in these former soldiers. \n\n[This article](https://medium.com/swlh/the-only-way-out-is-through-using-virtual-reality-for-ptsd-in-veterans-a0a3a0b1b3db?source=friends_link&amp;sk=67afc5dbc04e6a71afec35e744d68eb1) discussed an amazing personal experience working on an inpatient PTSD unit at the VA Hospital in New Orleans.
