Isn\u2019t in therapy or dealing with issues. Hi all,\n\nI work in the mental health field. Which I suppose lead to my conversation with my room mate about his past.\n\nI\u2019ve lived here for a month and started my convos with my room mate very basic about games and pop culture. Eventually went into coronavirus which then lead to life and some of\nHis past.\n\nWhich eventually found out he tried to kill him self in service and his only coping methods is isolation, his cat, video games, and anti depressants.\n\nHe is quiet and clean. Good room mate. Likes to talk every now and then.\n\nBut I feel that he could blow any minute and if he loses his job that could be the trigger.\n\nMy first reaction was I have a friend whose a vet and great person who offered to reach out to my room mate. He refused the help. My friend said to suggest This local non profit that helps\nVets to him. He refused to use them as help as well. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think there is much I can do\nIf he doesn\u2019t want help. It\u2019s depressing for me to watch some one self destruct. Especially when I know there is ways for prevent it. \n\nMaybe in time he will trust me more and reconsider the resources I\u2019ve suggested. \n\nHe said I\u2019m the first room mate he has had who cleans up apparently and has shown a genuine interest to his issues. \n\nThanks for any advice,\n\nSurferguy90"}, "255_ptsd": {"id": "255_ptsd", "text": "PTSD and Sex I don't know what messed up part of me makes me the way I am so I am seeking answers.

I remember vaguely one time when i raised my hand in elementary school and was like \u201cmy daddy cusses alot\u201d or something like that and i thought it was funny as i was only in 2nd grade or something. I feel like I completely blocked out my childhood which my therapist said is a sign of ptsd along with other symptoms i will describe later. As i was saying i blocked out alot of my childhood, i remember when i first started going to therapy when i was 13ish they would ask why i thought my childhood was toxic and what happened and I couldn\u2019t ever describe it in detail, this has happened multiple times between switching psychs and therapists and what i think is one of the main reasons a possible diagnosis was delayed for so long. I also have gotten panic attacks since around the same age (13) and currently have a diagnosis of panic disorder which i think will eventually be changed to ptsd. One of the main things that have effected me due to this was my horrible fear of any type of confrontation no matter how big or small even if it doesn\u2019t involve me, like for example say two people i know get into a small fight and you can feel the tension that could possibly cause me to cry or even have a panic attack. Or if it\u2019s a example that directly effects me like someone raising their voice at me, i will always cry without a doubt which has completely disrupted me having a job. This has also caused me to not be able to defend myself at all and i tend to get walked over ALOT and causes me to get in tons of toxic relationships amongst friendships and relationships. I was also sexually assaulted at 16 by a crush at the time and I don\u2019t feel comfortable going into detail with this part but with the toxic childhood I completely blocked it out so I don\u2019t get flashbacks with that trauma. But i know for sure i get flashbacks from the sexual assault I experienced as well as my mom often shaming me for the clothes i wear.

Three months before that, he screamed in my face and grabbed me by the shoulders. I ignored the blazing red flags. I still experience daily pain. Roughly twelve hours before that he'd shoved me over the couch (I have a serious back injury which I finally had my spine fused for recently, and that has long been a huge no no for me) and yanked my pants down to try to fuck me while his 4 y.o. daughter was in the bathroom. He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly. I was shocked because he hadn't done anything like that in the 11.5 months we'd been together, but as a testament to my prior experiences with abuse, I saw it as nothing terribly abnormal.

I wanted to wait until a year in, because I knew deep down he was a bad guy, but I wanted to be wrong. I wanted to be a mom (I can't have kids), and I wanted to save his daughter from the life I had growing up. He used this all against me. He's a narcissist and has some severely anti-social tendencies. \n\nLast night I had a nightmare involving me babysitting for him and his ex-wife, and their friends drugging me to rape me when they brought the party home. It brought back all the bad and my husband (we met two years ago next month) has super-hearing abilities and heard me crying while he was in the bathroom getting ready for work. He came out to hold me. Now he's gone and I'm crying again, damn it. It brought back all the memories of all the physical and sexual assaults and rapes I've experienced. People like that can smell a victim a mile away. \n\nThe shame is so overwhelming right now. That I let it happen. My entire life. From the first time I didn't say anything aged six. I just want to forget. I don't want to feel these people touching me. So many people, so many times, I've literally lost count. The things I've let happen because I never understood that people who love you don't hurt you like that. Things I let happen because I was conditioned to believe from such a young age that that is what life is. Hiding, hurting, and being used. Because I never saw the value in myself as a person. I still don't. I'm a garbage person. \n\nMy husband was the first to tell me that it wasn't normal to let myself be an object. A fuck toy and a punching bag. I had just accepted my fate that it was my place to be used and abused. That my normal was to live in fear of being hurt or fucked. I was 34 when we met. Now, after all the years of being used like a Kleenex, I feel so dirty, ashamed, and undeserving of someone as wonderful as he is. I feel like if he truly knew all that had happened, all the things I let happen, though I've shared a lot with him, that he would be disgusted. He's a better person than that, I know. But I feel unworthy of love, and unworthy of the safety I have with him now. This morning I told him I often wonder if I'd met him sooner, if I'd believe him or just brush him off as some bullshit fairytale who would eventually hurt me in the same ways. It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that.\n\nI'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all. A couple months ago I asked my psychiatrist if ECT would make me forget. Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out.
