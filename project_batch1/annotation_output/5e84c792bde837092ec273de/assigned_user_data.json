Hi everyone,\n\nI've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. \n\nI developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The World was a Different Place.** \n\n*A demon laughed* \n\n*at me while I* \n\n*begged my Father not to fire.*\n\n*The lights were off.*\n\n*Alone in the dark,*\n\n*I battled the night.*\n\n*The world was a Different place there.* \n\n*The womb of reality burst*\n\n*when the gun fired and an*\n\n*ungodly scream*\n\n*came through me*\n\n*and my Father swayed,*\n\n*a tortured tranquility in him*\n\n*before he fell to the ground.*\n\n*The pitch black pistol*\n\n*falling into the chair beside his body,*\n\n*aimed down to the hell*\n\n*that possessed him.*\n\n*The world was a Different place there.*\n\n*Grabbing the gun,*\n\n*sliding it to the other room,*\n\n*screaming for help.*\n\n*All in seconds,*\n\n*desperately racing to beat the clock*\n\n*of my Father\u2019s mortal life.*\n\n*The world was a Different place there.*\n\n*The memory fades*\n\n*Blood leaked across the floor*\n\n*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*\n\n*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* \n\n*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m here.

Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. \n\nHey Everyone,   \nFirst time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   \n\n\n1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. \n2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. \n3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him \"If you're gonna hit me, do it!\" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said \"Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her\". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me \"oh I fight with my brothers too!\" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. \n4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. \n5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that \"if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault\".   \n\n\nIn my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole \"PTSD\" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   \nIdk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this.
