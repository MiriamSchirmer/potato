{"id": "1204_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Could this be considered traumatic? NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.\n\n I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.\n\nMy father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to \"discuss\" it. \"Discussion\" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining \"how things are\"- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to \"misunderstand\", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a \"discussion\". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.\n\nThis was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing \"privilegies\" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and \"llike you mean it\". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.\n\nSometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.\n\nI was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.\n\nLimited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.\n\nMy friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.\n\nI realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.\n\nThank you in advance &lt;3", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1068, "end": 1262, "span": " explaining \"how things are\"- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to \"misunderstand\", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over.

(Sexual assault trigger warning) Writing this on my phone and it's hard to tell how  much I am actually writing. Sorry if it's super long.\n\nTL;DR History of sexual assault. I feeI like a fake because people have had it so much worse than me and yet my ptsd runs my life. Feel embarrassed by my lack of experience with men which is a consequence of PTSD.\n\nI have struggled with this for a long time and I have avoided posting about it because I have been afraid of people confirming these feelings. I have been on medication prescribed to me for PTSD for a few years now and this has been my only way of allowing myself to feel valid. I don't tell people about my PTSD but when I have to I feel like I need to somehow slip the fact that I am medicated into the disclosure so that I will be taken seriously. When I say \"have to\" I am referring to situations such as the time I signed up for a self defense class and I needed them to know not to get on top of me in any way (will make sense later) and that I needed a female teacher. I needed to mention the PTSD for context. \n\nA little background: I have always had a fear of men and I can't really pinpoint when it started or why, but it was always more severe than the unfortunately common intimidation that many women tend to feel. I remember feeling this way as early as 7 or 8. I would avoid men in general. Experiences such as being cat called and followed in my early teens made it worse. \n\nThe experience which really caused my PTSD happened just after i moved away from home for college. I was at a friends house one night and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up in the middle of the night with a guy 'friend' straddling me and giving me hickeys and trying to take off my clothing. I told him to get off me multiple times and he didn't. I curled up into a fetal position until he gave up and left. It felt like he was on top of me for hours but I'm guessing it was more like 15 or 20 minutes. Nothing more happened, he got off me and fell asleep somewhere in the apartment, but it left me anxious and depressed for months.  I felt dirty and guilty. I couldn't look men in the eyes and any romantic attention from men felt even more threatening than it did for me already, even if I knew that they were probably very nice guys. Because of this I have never had a boyfriend. Never slept with a man. The first and last time I had sexual contact with a man was when I woke up to someone who I thought I could trust sucking on my neck and putting his hand under my blanket. I am nearly 25 now. Its embarrassing to me and I am afraid that, at this point, if I manage to move past the anxiety of male attention that I will scare away any man with my lack of experience.\n\nThat was the first one. The second event, which blew everything up, was when I was jumped walking home at night. I am a runner and a lot stronger than I look as a small woman and managed to get away. It left me so traumatized, though, because I tried really hard to get help and no one would help me. The security guard at my apartment building told me to stop talking and tell the female security guard who was only going to be working 4 days later, and the police laughed at me when I described what happened. (Might sound unlikely but I was living in another country at this time and this isnt uncommon behavior there).\n\nAt this point I would physically start to shake if I was hanging out with a man and he got touchy. Panic attack symptoms minus hyperventilation. \nI would feel my body go cold and my muscles seize up. There was a situation when I was trying to get over this all and had been on a few dates with a guy. He kissed me and all was fine until he touched my thigh and I started having a panic attack. I was so embarrassed and humiliated because he immediately left the room to tell him roommates. Yes, I know, I found myself an asshole.\n\nThat left me with really unhealthy views of men (even more than before) and I genuinely believed for a very long time that men did not feel love and that any appearance of love was purely a form of manipulation. These experiences along with an unfortunate mother (who would tell me things like \"all men cheat\") caused me to be so scared to fall in love because to me that would mean being a slave. It took me a very long time to realise that men do feel love. People will probably be wondering this: my father is in my life and he is a good man. One of the most honest and loving people I know. No issues there.\n\nAnyway, here I am years later. I have been through therapy, take antianxiety/antidepressants and have managed to cut down my PTSD meds to \"as needed\". So, Prazosin when I have nightmares, and that's all. I still get incredibly uncomfortable with men touching me and i am terrified of sex and it stops me from pursuing men I like. I am so worried that they will not be patient with me and that i am embarrassing. \n\nIt's also hard to know when to bring this up with a man because I dont want to scare him off but at the same time I dont want him to scare me off by going at a pace I cant handle. \n\nTo bring it back to my post title....I feel like a fraud.

{"id": "1225_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Possible trauma from hospitalization, and people think I need to get over it. I was 21 at the time, now I'm 22. In May of 2017, I got really sick out of no where. In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. \n\nAt 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. \n\nThe doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said \"what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?\" I said I didn't know what was wrong. \n\nAfter they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. \n\nThey discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a \"nasty fever\" and told me to rest for a few days.\n\nAt 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. \n\nPositive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.\n\nBeing septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. \n\nI returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). \n\nNow I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well \"hey, she didn't have cancer\" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. \n\nI constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. \n\nThank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest.

{"id": "802_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Any advice for coping with PTSD in college? (TW: Abuse/Sexual Assault) I grew up in a very neglectful, borderline abusive household and, as a teenager ended up in a situation where I was being regularly assaulted by an acquaintance/family friend. I feared for my life (my abuser was becoming increasingly violent) and for my future (my family was refusing me access to college resources). This whole situation culminated in me leaving home at 17 and moving across the country. The year following my leaving was really hard. I didn't think that I would be able to go to college at all (where I'd gotten in, I couldn't afford it) and was struggling to support myself/with my mental health.\n\nThis year, I got a full scholarship to a wonderful school and I'm so incredibly excited! It's everything I've ever wanted, but at the same time, I think that the stress of the upcoming change (I move in three weeks) is already making my PTSD symptoms worse. I know that I'm going to be away from my significant other and my dog, who really help me to cope. Plus, I'm going to be forced to be around people a lot more.

On an alt account, and mobile, all the apologies.\n\nTw: statutory rape, self harm\n\nI've been up all night looking up my ex and his wife again. For the first time I found their Reddit handles, I read everything they've posted tonight. One small mention of me, saying he started dating her two weeks before he broke up with me.\n\nThe ten year anniversary of our breakup is coming up. This is harder than I thought. I have witnessed so much other hardy, deadly, tragic shit in those ten years--but this motherfucker is what keeps me up at night.\n\nI was underage when we met, jesus fuck I was 14. He was 19, nearly 20. I just needed love so badly, I was willing to go along with his gross bullshit. I was not the only underage girl he dated. He cheated on me a few times before leaving me for her. I was miserable, I was obsessed with the pain. I made plans to move out of my hometown the moment I graduated. For eight months I pined, but I held on so I could get out.\n\nTwo weeks before I moved out on my own, barely 17, she messaged me. She told me all of the terrible shit he had done and that she believed in complete honesty. The night I left she tried to start a group sex situation with my friends and me. Cue a solid year of manipulation and weird moments where they tried to get me alone and have sex with me. Or she would talk to me on the phone for hours. Or she would demonize me to everyone, including my nest friend.\n\nA few months after I turned 18 I met his double, a guy who could have followed him in a lineup. He got me pregnant, and although I had an abortion, the hormones made me lose my shit just enough to cut all of them out and take some space for myself. I voluntarily spent a year celibate from 18-19.\n\nI've been healing ever since. I have a hard time on nights like tonight, based on his posts he seems to think he has messed up but moved on. But like, isn't he a statutory rapist? Doesn't anyone care about that? I know I didn't but I was the victim you know?\n\nI just can't forgive, or move on. She wants kids, he wants a vasectomy. The cracks in their compatibility will widen and their toxicity will leak out eventually, even if they are happy now (to my disappointment). It only feels like that makes me feel better for a second, like having a cigarette or self harming.
