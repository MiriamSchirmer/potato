{"id": "816_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I have PTSD because of a volitile relationship It's a very long story and it's pretty dark. But here goes. I was with this girl for three years and we had a house together, pets, you name it. Well we started fighting a lot and she had self harm issues. Our fights would start out small and next thing you know, we were screaming in the house, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg. She would lock herself in a room and try to cut herself in the middle of these fights, so I would break into the room to stop her (my mind immediately shifting to I'm not fighting with her anymore, I'm going to try and stop her and show her I love her), but she never let up. She would resort to brutally beating me in the face to get me away from her and say the most horrible things to me. She would tell me I was a loser, I was ugly, fat, and all sorts of things that I refuse to remember. I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts. I lied to my friends and said that I got my black eye from work. I remember one time specifically was at AWA, and all of my friends that were there, surrounded me and wouldn't leave me alone about my black eye, which wasn't the first one. I lied to them again and then I told them I had to pee, and went to the bathroom and cried really hard. Fast forward to the end, a couple of years ago. I had a concussion at work. I fell into a running compactor and hit my head, and my boss saved my life. I completely forgot the previous two months, including my sister getting engaged and everything. They wouldn't let me drive or watch movies or anything until I recovered. It was a nightmare. Well I started getting my memory back and she started a fight with me because my friend was coming to see me and she \"wanted to do her workout.\" it escaladed very quickly to the same routine as before only this time I broke a statue that we got together and I threw the flowers I got her on the floor and the cops were called again and said one of us had to leave for the night. She kicked me out and broke up with me and never let me come back. I couldn't drive at the time she made me stay outside until my mom came and got me. I begged her not to do it, because I was in love with her despite everything and she treated me like a criminal and condemned me. She tried to turn all of my friends against me (which failed horribly for the most part) and told everyone that I was the one abusing her. I never touched her like that and I never said anything so horrible to her. I treated her like gold 95% of the time and I cared about her more than anything. I left her a long letter on the porch a week after all of this, explaining how much she meant to me and that I wanted a new start with her and she called the cops to tell me to leave her alone and told everyone that I was a psycho.

{"id": "235_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Hyper-vigilance in the classroom Hi there, I've been scrolling through here for a good half-hour now and I think i might be able to get some advice here.   \n\n\nI don't qualify as having PTSD, but I suffer from generalized anxiety, depression, and the occasional psychotic symptoms (usually triggered by extreme stress). I'm being treated for all of these things, but my therapist mentioned hyper-vigilance and survivors guilt and I figured I'd look into it myself. My current problem is similar to descriptions of hyper-vigilance, and I thought it might be worth asking about here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntw// suicide mentions, murder/suicide, gun violence, school shootings  \n\n\nA little bit of background: While I was in high school, I was intensely suicidal. It was really, really bad. On top of that, every year I attended (Freshman, Sophomore, and half of my Junior year) someone died. Two were plain suicides and one was a murder/suicide, in which a gun was brought on campus. I dropped out and got my GED and it's been a few years since, and I've decided to go to community college. I really want to be able to live comfortably. I want to learn and push forward and try to find which career I'd like to pursue, and since I'm just uncertain about everything (and can't work a retail job to save my life) junior college seems right.   \n\n\nAs the date of my first class is getting closer, The anxiety about the situation keeps growing. I'm terrified that my hyper-vigilance is going to affect my work. In restaurants and at shows (like a friend's aerial arts performance) I cannot sit with my back to the door without either whipping around or having a panic attack. More recently it's been easier, but sometimes that's not even enough. Most classrooms are situated with student's backs to the door and if I have to keep examining the room and looking over my shoulder, I don't know what I'll do. Additionally, loud noises like objects being dropped scare the shit out of me and will throw me right into a loop if I can't quickly identify it.  \n\n\nI don't know how to cope in that situation. I don't know how I'm going to cope sitting on campus between classes without freaking out about the possibility of someone coming in to hurt me. I was hoping someone might have advice here, because honestly the way that I've coped up to this point is by facing the door or having my back to a wall and watching every new person that comes in the room until my brain is satisfied.   \n\n\ntl; dr: experiencing a symptom of PTSD without actual diagnosis/thinking i actually have PTSD, but am reaching out because of how one aspect of my anxiety behaves. I have a hard time coping with crowds and academic environments because I believe someone is going to hurt me (and others) and I go into a hyper-vigilant state, how could I cope with it when my usual methods won't be able to be used?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nofc, I won't know how any suggestions will work until school actually starts, but I've been trying to think of some ideas just to calm down the current worrying about it.

I'm sorry, it'll be a long story.\n\nThe first thing I remember being related to this would be when I was 11. I ended up with a picture of an 18yo corpse, in midst of the most disgusting putrefaction. I'd never dared to imagine that was what was coming to me when I'll end up dead. Of course, you can imagine it traumatized me. I couldn't sleep for weeks, I was terrified of the dark and this picture haunted me, forced itself into my mind and I saw it literally everywhere.\n\nIt sounds stupid. I know. It gets worse.\n\nI developed, what I understood way later, something called as necrophobia. I realized it when my mother died 2 years ago. I barely mourned her, or maybe I did but in a really quiet and subtle way I still do not understand. I couldn't show up to her burying. It was definitely impossible. I just said goodbye to her while she was getting medicated and ran off when they decided to euthanize her. I couldn't get to see her for the last time as something that terrifies me. I just couldn't. I can't describe it. There was no way.\n\nYet.. something did change. I changed.. a bit. I developed a close relationship to death. Not in a way that makes me want to join her. But a sense of morbidity and nihilism I did not know I had. \n\nIt developed further as I wanted to confront myself. To make these flashes stop. Just like I did when I was terrified of bees. I decided to confront my fears, to watch death in front of my very eyes. To rationalize it. To be, let's say.. desensitized.\n\nThis was the poorest choice of my life. I ended up watching dozens and dozens of pictures, videos. I saw dead people. I saw dying people. Various ways. Horrendous ways. I really don't want to tell what I saw. I'm not made for this. I've never been made for this. Now I'm back to being 11. But 10x worse. I have regular flashbacks of these, each time I turn the lights off. Each time I see a violent clip in a movie or a strange music plays on. It's been months, and it stained me. It damaged me. I can't stop thinking about my mother now. What she endured. What she felt. My stomach tightens whenever it crosses my mind. I fear I might have developed PTSD.. or I maybe I dug an old one up. I feel totally lost. And it hurts so much. I feel like I brought this on myself. \n\n\nTLDR : I'm weak and stupid. Never watch these.

I had shoved my childhood abuse in a closet to never look at it again.\n\nBut after months of sleep deprivation, fixating on having to be the perfect mom and excessive paranoid thoughts of my beautiful child dying or being kidnapped I was coming undone at the seems.\n\nMy husband pushes me to go to therapy and I learned that my erratic moods, my paranoia, my insomnia... just every little thing that made my life hard was real.

I held her close and I promised myself I would die before I ever let my anger scare my child again.
