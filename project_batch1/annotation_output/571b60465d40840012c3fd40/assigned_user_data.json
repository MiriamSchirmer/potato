In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen.

This year i wanted to go to university again, but my medical condition is a living hell. My problem is my body is 24/7 in an \"emergency situation\". That means it feels to me like my own body is a prison/enemy to me. I can barely breathe, i dont sleep well (for years) and my stomach is so hard to the point i feel emotionless. It feels to me this is taking 80% of my energy. Over the year  \"being depressed\" became the new normal for me.\n\nThe relationship to my parents is really difficult. I experienced a lot of abuses. Want some examples?\n- At age 7 i was trying to sleep in a room with my brother in the evening. I was scared of \"monsters\" under the bed, so i asked my little brother if he could come to sleep beside me (children), so i dont need to be scared anymore. A few moments later my fundamental religious father came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground. Then he started to beat my little childrens body with his foot. My stomach hurt was hit by his foot. 1 Minute later my mum came to him, but she just observed and didnt do anything. Then it began to hurt so much, i was thinking i would die. So i crawled on my knees to my mothers feet and told her  \"mommy please tell him to stop\". But he kept going by this time punching me in the face, so blood came out of my nose. As he noticed the blood, he grabbed me by my t-shirt and pulled me like a dog to the bathroom, where he forced me to wash my blood. I was so little i couldnt reach the water so he gave me something to stand above. While cleaning the blood i was crying and most importantly my body was vibrating enormously.\n\n- At age 8 i should take my little brother to play with my friend outdoors. Like most children i wanted to play with my own friends and don't want to ( Alone the fact letting a 5years and 8 years old playing for several hours alone on the street is crazy). Then my father saw me coming down the street and asked where i was, i said \"i was on the playground\". As he knew i didnt take my brother with me, he was so aggressive i got scared of him. I literally was so scared i began to run away from him. I ran the street down and now comes the crazy thing. He began to run wild after me and i screamed as loud as a i could \"HELP\", but nobody noticed. As i couldnt run anymore, i instinctively put my hands before my face, in fear he would punch me in the face. \n\n-At Age 6 i behave badly in the opinion of my parents and they scared to beat me, so i left the building block and waited infront of the bus stop for several hours in the cold. I Brief the whole time and each time a bus come by (every 20 minutes) i started to control it, so no stranger noticed me. Every two minutes i looked to the door, to look if they let me in again.\n\n- At age 16 i was really hungry and cooked a little meal for myself. My father told me i should share it with my brother. I told him no, there is enough left he can cook for himself, he is old enough. He was so angry he took my plate with the food on it and threw it in front of me into the garbage. Then he became more aggressive and and destroyed the plate with a spoon in front my eyes and forced me to clean everything up. At this time school already was really hard for me emotional, so i cried silently desperate while cleaning everything.\n\n- One day at age 15 or so he came in a aggressive mood in my childrens room ( dont remember why), we had a discussion and then began to threat me by coming really near to me, holding his fingers between his teeths saying \"iam craazy\".", "displayed_text": "What do you think, do i have ptsd?

I have been suffering from depression and anxiety since the last three years, and I couldn't get any medical help as my parents said they \"don't believe in mental diseases\" and only recently, as I managed to get some professional help, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and insomnia, and this was about two months back.\n\nI have always felt that my symptoms more or less would be better diagnosed as PTSD. I have been in taking medication for the last few months.\n\nI have been having panic attacks since the last three years, with varied intensity, although avoiding triggers have been helpful. When they are very intense, I kinda seem to go into this flashback where I feel as if I am in a past event of my life and things are repeating themselves. As could be understood, my body tries to prevent this by going into a state of panic before and all this combined with the anxiety of panic attacks and my past and all those memories make my life so much harder and deteriorate the quality of living to very substantial levels. \n\nA couple of days back, something triggered me and I was about to have a panic attack. As I was on medication, I was able to let it happen, and soon, I was in this flashback which related to the times where I was little and my parents used to abuse me physically. They used to beat me, for invalid reasons, for trying to take their angry out, or express their emotions. And suddenly, I understood what was going wrong. I was afraid. I was afraid, that they would kill me, and I won't be able to stop them or do anything, and this was the same feeling as 10-12 years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this time, I did something different. When I was in the flashback, I.... I stopped my dad. I grabbed the stick he was using to beat, and I tried to stop him. But he wouldn't. He tried to hurt me again, but then, in order to defend myself, I had to hurt him. But even then he wouldn't stop. So I kept hurting him, and I started feeling better and secure. It was as if the fear was going away and no one could harm me. But then my mum comes in the picture and she starts hurting me, and I did the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I found myself being safe, I was able to control myself, and breathe properly, and the thing ended. I still had my mind numb for a while, as usually happens with my panic attacks, but I felt better.\n\nAm I okay? Can you please give me your opinion on this?
