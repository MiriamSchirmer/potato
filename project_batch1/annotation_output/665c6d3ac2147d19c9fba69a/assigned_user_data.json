The nightmare is always brief and is set exactly in my setting (my room, the hotel I\u2019m staying in, etc.) It\u2019s hard to call it a night mare because it occurs as I\u2019m waking from sleep, but in the moment it feels as though I\u2019m waking because of the thing happening in the nightmare. \n\nFor example, tonight I woke with a start and saw a man peeking his head into my bedroom. My door was ajar and I clearly saw a mans face, leaning over and peering into my room. I yelled out (actually yelled, I was awake at this point) \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d Or \u201cwho are you?\u201d I\u2019m not sure.

When we began dating, we had known each other for a few months (work), and anxiety was apparent. I learned of her PTSD and Depression shortly into the relationship. I deal with depression myself, so I wasn\u2019t about to give up on someone for things they can\u2019t control. I was clear with her of my goal for her in our relationship: to be happy and healthy.\n\nHer family life is almost non existent, and she has moved around most of her life. She severed ties with (some of) the abusive relationships in her life about 2 years ago. We moved in together because we spent most of our time together and we wanted to save money. It\u2019s been almost 2 years living together (after only 8-10 months of dating). Cracks are beginning to show.\n\nWe have two roommates, who I like very much. She always got along with them until recently. Our apartment is 2 couples, M-F / M-F. It\u2019s a two bedroom, so yes, it gets a little cramped, even though its a big place, one bathroom is a constant pest. \n\nLately (past 6 months), the girl living with us has made it clear about keeping things clean, using our own appliances.. usual passive-aggressive roommate stuff. I\u2019m used to it, I do NOT take it personally from the girl, we still chat in a very friendly way frequently, and I\u2019m good friends with her boyfriend. I see these grievances as small troubles, roommates setting boundaries, etc.\n\nWe have lived with this couple for the entirety of us living together. Problems just started to arise about 6 months ago. The girl would get pissed at messy bathroom, moldy stuff in fridge, etc. NEVER became vocal about these problems. Began to show some passive aggressive behavior: Slamming bathroom door, leaving notes, sending TWO texts, JUST TWO over a few months.\n\nI see this stuff as normal, my girlfriend is losing her mind. The slamming of bathroom doors led to her having flashbacks of her shitty father. I spoke with the roommate, and explained the situation. It stopped happening. The girl asked that my GF start using her own electric kettle due to overlapping morning schedules. My GF\u2019s electric kettle was given to her by one of her attackers at her last apartment. That was hard to explain to girl, so we gave it away to avoid more triggers for my girlfriend.\n\nNow, my girlfriend is being triggered by the girl loudly doing her own dishes. This, I had to make a stand on. They were not my gf\u2019s dishes. She had no dogs in the fight. Yet she blamed her INCREDIBLE anger where she stormed into our room and stayed for the night, on loud dish-doing. \n\nMy girlfriend is not a clean person. I can deal with it, try to get her to clean, but it is not my roommates\u2019 fault that she is this way. \n\nThe girl left a note on a tupperware container tonight saying \u2018PLEASE DISPOSE\u2019 and my girlfriend lost it. Inside? A month of veggie smoothie mix that had a lump of mold in it so large that I couldn\u2019t wash it down the sink, I had to pick it out and trash it.\n\nMy girlfriend? Threw a fit and LEFT IT OUT on the counter. Walked away from it. Meanwhile the moldy cup in the living room I asked her to clean will start a fight if I bring it up. \n\nThe note? She wrote 'FUCK OFF' on it, then threw it away out of regret(?). Left it for me (I guess?) to clean, like everything else.\n\n\nThis escalation between the girl and my GF is getting out of hand. We are moving in 6months. I believe that my GF is overreacting and its unnecessary anger, stress, and confusion adding to the situation. \n\nI have stood by my GF for almost 3 years. I have read about PTSD, slowly pushed her towards treatment (finally got her to the Dr for anti-depressants, she hadn\u2019t been to a Dr in many many years). I have tried (slowly) to get her to therapy.. we made a few appointments that she canceled (a while ago). \n\nI feel like my GF isn\u2019t trying. She is being overloaded. She is also being selfish and rude when that is in NO WAY the person I knew years ago. I have been patient with her conditions. I have tried nothing but to help her. I have made stands on some things (almost exclusively cleaning, especially our room that looks like a disaster area, due to her). I\u2019m approaching the end of my rope. Completely ignoring me begging her for years to clean, explaining that it stresses me out the way her triggers do, is starting to really piss me off and make me feel like she doesn't care about my happiness if it means an ounce of work for her. \n\n**TL;DR** My GF is freaking out over my roommate\u2019s recent actions. I believe it is a completely irrational response. I have taken triggers into consideration, but believe she is being selfish and closing off. I have tried to help her as much as possible, but I have my fears that if this is how she acts now, what will our future (on a different coast we\u2019re moving to) hold.

I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. \n\nAbout a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. \n\nLots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. \n\nThe day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear \"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said \"one sec\" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. \n\nDuring this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. \n\nSince I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. \n\nIt got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. \n\nDo I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. \n\nI miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself.

I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. \n\nSince I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. \n\nIt got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. \n\nDo I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. \n\nI miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. \n\nanything will help.
