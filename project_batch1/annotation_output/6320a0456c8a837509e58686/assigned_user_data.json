A family member mentioned something about possible sexual abuse, but this topic is very avoided by our family, so it\u2019s never discussed. \n\nMy older brother (29) was seriously affected by the abuse he endured, and now has his own set of struggles and problems he faces as an adult. This includes uncontrollable anger, violence to his girlfriend, screaming, throwing things (anything from a mug to a dinner chair) around when things don\u2019t go his way, threatening suicide, and more. I lived with him and my mom for a few years like this and this caused me to be very sensitive to noise, particularly made by men. I don\u2019t live with them anymore. I have been afraid and wary of men for my whole life, and part of me wants to keep it that way for my safety even though I know it causes me a lot of pain in my every day of life.\n\nWithout getting too into details, my long distance girlfriend (22) visited a BDSM dungeon to learn what it was about and instantly had a 70 year old man infatuated with her. He invited her to his house to teach her, and I strongly discouraged her from going. After an impact play session at the dungeon and some time, she asked me if she could go to his house for more sessions because he wanted it so badly. We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. \n\nThis man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn\u2019t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He\u2019d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.\n\nOne of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend\u2019s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. \n\nHe continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me. I already had an extreme aversion to the idea of sex with men, especially old men, and I couldn\u2019t handle that. I messaged my girlfriend that night that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch any more of their sessions.\n\nSome time passed, she had one or two more sessions with him (I tried to think about it as little as possible while it was going on so I wasn\u2019t keeping count), and my girlfriend moved for school in early fall. After a while, I believed that he was in the past and wouldn\u2019t be a problem again. Eventually, my girlfriend and I discussed this and she realized how creepy this situation actually was, and she felt extremely uncomfortable with how familiar this old man was with her body. We agreed that we shouldn\u2019t have contact with him anymore and she told him this politely in a text. We tried to move on together and leave this in the past.\n\nAnd then he posted photos of her body on a BDSM website without her consent. She asked him to take it down, he refused.

Nearly of my trauma related reactions have funneled into this and it\u2019s more extreme than anything I\u2019ve experienced before.\n\nThankfully, I will be started EMDR therapy soon, and I really really hope to see improvement one day. I think I might need to quit my job. I feel like I\u2019m going to die when I have to ring up an old man, I can barely speak to them and I can\u2019t look them in the eyes. I\u2019ve cried throughout typing this and I am so scared about going back to work every single day.\n\nDoes it make sense that my triggers and reactions changed so much just by this situation I didn\u2019t even experience firsthand?", "displayed_text": "PTSD from another\u2019s experience Trigger warning for sexual content, BDSM, similarities with pedophilia, mention of parental abuse, mention of suicide\n\nTo give a little background, I (23F) was abused my by dad for the first 6 years of my life, physically and verbally. A family member mentioned something about possible sexual abuse, but this topic is very avoided by our family, so it\u2019s never discussed. \n\nMy older brother (29) was seriously affected by the abuse he endured, and now has his own set of struggles and problems he faces as an adult. This includes uncontrollable anger, violence to his girlfriend, screaming, throwing things (anything from a mug to a dinner chair) around when things don\u2019t go his way, threatening suicide, and more. I lived with him and my mom for a few years like this and this caused me to be very sensitive to noise, particularly made by men. I don\u2019t live with them anymore. I have been afraid and wary of men for my whole life, and part of me wants to keep it that way for my safety even though I know it causes me a lot of pain in my every day of life.\n\nWithout getting too into details, my long distance girlfriend (22) visited a BDSM dungeon to learn what it was about and instantly had a 70 year old man infatuated with her. He invited her to his house to teach her, and I strongly discouraged her from going. After an impact play session at the dungeon and some time, she asked me if she could go to his house for more sessions because he wanted it so badly. We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. \n\nThis man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn\u2019t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He\u2019d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.\n\nOne of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend\u2019s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. \n\nHe continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me. I already had an extreme aversion to the idea of sex with men, especially old men, and I couldn\u2019t handle that. I messaged my girlfriend that night that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch any more of their sessions.\n\nSome time passed, she had one or two more sessions with him (I tried to think about it as little as possible while it was going on so I wasn\u2019t keeping count), and my girlfriend moved for school in early fall. After a while, I believed that he was in the past and wouldn\u2019t be a problem again.

Here we go\n\nMy first memory of my father was when I was 2 to 4, my mom was leaving for work, he was hungover I'm assuming and I was crying staring out the window because she was leaving me, I didn't stop after she left, I remember my dad had his hand on his face not looking well, barley attempting to calm me down when he grabbed my pj shirt and slapped me across the face, the memory ends there.

I would run away from him when I would get in trouble and he would chase me around the house snapping his leather belt over and over until he caught me and would then beat me bare ass with it, I can't remember the pain or even being hit with the belt, I just remember the before it happened. I do remember I would become hysterical often but I can't clear up andly specific memories, I just feel the emotion and I know it happened often. \n\nThe next portion of memories start when I thought my parents, mainly my dad, my mom was never abusive, would turn into wear wolves when I would turn my back, everytime I turned around I thought they were sneaking up on me claws over their heads about to eat me, I would often follow them around and try to catch them, I had a fear of being alone because I always thought they were going to get me if I wasn't paying attention. this continued until around 10 or 11, I don't know why that thought process stopped but it just did.\n\nI know my dad was also verbally abusive but I can't really remember specifics I just know it happened often.

The inappropriate behavior of exposing me to adult things like porn and inappropriate movies, letting me drink a beer or some wine, no sexual abuse I can remember so that's a relief.

We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn\u2019t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He\u2019s not able to workout because he\u2019s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. \n\nI was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.\n\nI feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn\u2019t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he\u2019s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It\u2019s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...\n\nNot to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing.

We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn\u2019t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He\u2019s not able to workout because he\u2019s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. \n\nI was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.\n\nI feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn\u2019t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he\u2019s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It\u2019s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...\n\nNot to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing. It\u2019s just so much to deal with all at once and I just feel so alone like no one else can understand what I\u2019m going through."}, "2400_counseling": {"id": "2400_counseling", "text": "I have so many issues to address.
