At any given time, over 13 MILLION Americans have PTSD. Meanwhile, over 14,000 military members report sexual assault every year.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 83% of military sexual assaults go unreported, meaning there could be upwards of 82,500 military sexual assaults happening PER YEAR. Since my own military sexual assault in the Marines, 3 months before 9/11, there have been approximately 1.4 MILLION other victims in the military alone. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of joining and chatting with numerous social media groups formed to support PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors.\n\nThere are thousands in these groups, yet there are millions more suffering on their own. PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.\n\nTo show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.\n\nMy story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.\n\nIn my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.\n\nIn the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain. After years on this journey, I have decided to write a book about my experience.\n\nThis book is currently in pre-order sales and will be for the next 24 hours. The journey offers some parallels to The Alchemist and Forrest Gump, though this journey is true.\n\nYour support would go a long way to ensure this story gets told and the conversation around PTSD really gets started.

At any given time, over 13 MILLION Americans have PTSD. Meanwhile, over 14,000 military members report sexual assault every year.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 83% of military sexual assaults go unreported, meaning there could be upwards of 82,500 military sexual assaults happening PER YEAR. Since my own military sexual assault in the Marines, 3 months before 9/11, there have been approximately 1.4 MILLION other victims in the military alone. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of joining and chatting with numerous social media groups formed to support PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors.\n\nThere are thousands in these groups, yet there are millions more suffering on their own. PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.\n\nTo show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.\n\nMy story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.\n\nIn my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.\n\nIn the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain. After years on this journey, I have decided to write a book about my experience.\n\nThis book is currently in pre-order sales and will be for the next 24 hours.

I am trying to be self positive and saying that I must have needed this time but as deadlines and exams dates get closer I just can\u2019t help but feel insufficient. Like I am not capable a facing \u201cnormal\u201d life. Teachers and friends just keep saying things like \u201coh well your computer breaking just happens sometimes\u201d and \u201cfalling down the stairs and spraining your ankle is just a bad day\u201d and having to pick your self up and play fun best friend to a girl turning 21 in New York City \u201cshould be an amazing time\u201d and having debilitating stomach pain when eating almost anything just sucks. I know all these things are true but I feel like all these people would handle it without feeling bedridden and self harming. Im really not feeling sorry for myself about any of these things happening either because I can recognize that it\u2019s \u201cjust life\u201d. I\u2019m just really struggling and my only support is a weekly call with my therapist back home as I also try to find someone here at school.
