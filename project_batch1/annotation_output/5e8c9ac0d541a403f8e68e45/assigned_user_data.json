I (24/f) grew up in a favela and had some life events happen to me Why I want insight: from the age 15-18 I tried to self-diagnose a bunch but then by 18 I felt like it was just a regular \u201cgrowing up and figuring it out\u201d phase. The one label I have identified with since then is the good ol\u2019 \u201canxiety\u201d. Everyone has it. So in a sense I have felt \u201cnormal\u201d. I have worked through a bunch of things that I attributed to how my parents raised me and I would honestly say that I am a generally happy, positive person.\n\nNow, here is what got me started on thinking about this: A few days ago I did coke for the first time ever (I\u2019m not a druggie. All I have done is the somewhat regular weed and occasional alcohol). No big deal. I didn\u2019t trip out or enjoy it. I simply felt nothing from it. I snorted my last dose of it close to 10PM. At around 3AM I tried to sleep. I was at a cheap motel and in the room next us there were some people having a party and talking a little too loud, walking in and out of the room. Sometimes it sounded like they would be walking into my room \u2014 a thought which I could easily dismiss but a feeling that I couldn\u2019t shake. I was on full-on alert. I felt as if I was going to be \u201cdisturbed\u201d, that something or someone would be making me get up and I was scared. The more I thought of it, the less what I felt seemed cocaine-related, and the more I could think about other times I felt the same way.\n\nSo, here is my background:\nI am from a neigbourhood called Piedade, in Rio de Janeiro. Born and raised there until I was 8/9 years old. I moved with my family around Brazil until I was 15, at which point we moved to Canada. \nRio is a dangerous (!!!), violent place. My neighbourhood was a favela. Not the worst one but a favela nevertheless. I can recall most nights falling asleep to the sounds of gunshots. I can\u2019t really recall the sound of gunshots nowadays until I hear one. I have been caught up in the line of fire quite a few times. Most of them were on the streets and we would just stay put in corners of the house. Some of them were while I was out on the streets and had to just scoot down in the car or run and hide inside nearby stores. One of my earliest memories is of me being woken up in a hurry by my parents. They just grabbed me and my brother and took us to the bathroom. Our doors and windows were gridded and someone \u2014 or in my memory as a child, something scary \u2014 was banging on them. I honestly don\u2019t remember much of that anymore. Just the paralyzing fear, attentiveness, confusion. What happened was that someone was getting followed by a gang to be killed. We had a big yard and this guy jumped into our property. My parents, who were outside, heard neighbours yelling to warn them and they ran inside to get us. The gang arrived, our neighbor was an ex cop, and a shootout happened all around us. But like I said, it\u2019s mostly a feeling to me.\nWe left Rio when I was 8/9 and I witnessed a lot less of that type of violence. I continued to witness robberies and assaults. A lot of noisy situations. Looking back at it, robbers tend to make their presences known when they are trying to intimidate people with noise.\nAnyway, that was until I was 15 and we left to come to Canada.\n15 was also just about the age when my dad stopped hitting me. He had some anger bursts for no good reason.\nIn a few instances in Brazil, and once in Canada, I was groped very indiscreetly.\nThen in Canada, once I was 18/19 I was living alone in a basement. I got out of my shower, heard some loud bangs on my door. I froze. Some people burst through, looked at me, ran away. I was shocked but still managed to call the cops right away. I just couldn\u2019t think properly enough to explain it to them in as much detail as they wanted.\n\nSo here I am today. I have recurring nightmares quite often. I would say I could go a week having nightmares only. Someone usually dies in my dreams. Most times I am killed in it, other times I am the one killing. Occasionally, in these dreams, someone else will die in front of me. In real life when I hear loud noises my mind freezes. If someone is talking to me after a noisy disturbance I can \u201cgo with it\u201d but about 30 seconds to a few minutes later I have to ask them to rewind because I wasn\u2019t \u201cthere\u201d anymore. I have really, really, really light sleep. I feel tired all the time. I don\u2019t like spending nights alone at home. Sometimes not even days. If I do, I keep checking on doors, windows and peep behind curtains. If I\u2019m alone I barely sleep or sleep super late until it\u2019s light out. I don\u2019t feel comfortable in loud places (unless there\u2019s rythm/music).\n\nAnyway, like I said in the beginning, I am still a generally happy person. My anxiety, other than what I just described above, is not a big part of my life anymore. But also, what I call anxiety I have usually attributed to that \u201cworrying\u201d feeling that I will fail or something will go wrong because of me and my decisions (money, school). So, I guess I am wondering if what I described is something like ptsd or if I am just being dramatic and trying to label myself again. But also, part of me feels as if I have made huge progress with my anxiety and that it shed a light into something hidden deeper \u2014 I have made peace with the things I used to blame for my anxiety, yet some feelings of uneasiness linger on. I was wondering if I could have ptsd to any extent (none or mild to moderate maybe?). \n\nPlease tell me what you think. Personal experiences relating to it and even not relating to it would be appreciated. I\u2019m obviously not going to use your opinions as diagnosis but it would help to have a frame of reference. \n\nThanks for reading this long ass post.", "displayed_text": "TW: violence/sexual abuse. Is it possible that my anxiety is ptsd related? I (24/f) grew up in a favela and had some life events happen to me Why I want insight: from the age 15-18 I tried to self-diagnose a bunch but then by 18 I felt like it was just a regular \u201cgrowing up and figuring it out\u201d phase. The one label I have identified with since then is the good ol\u2019 \u201canxiety\u201d. Everyone has it. So in a sense I have felt \u201cnormal\u201d. I have worked through a bunch of things that I attributed to how my parents raised me and I would honestly say that I am a generally happy, positive person.\n\nNow, here is what got me started on thinking about this: A few days ago I did coke for the first time ever (I\u2019m not a druggie. All I have done is the somewhat regular weed and occasional alcohol). No big deal. I didn\u2019t trip out or enjoy it. I simply felt nothing from it. I snorted my last dose of it close to 10PM. At around 3AM I tried to sleep. I was at a cheap motel and in the room next us there were some people having a party and talking a little too loud, walking in and out of the room. Sometimes it sounded like they would be walking into my room \u2014 a thought which I could easily dismiss but a feeling that I couldn\u2019t shake. I was on full-on alert. I felt as if I was going to be \u201cdisturbed\u201d, that something or someone would be making me get up and I was scared. The more I thought of it, the less what I felt seemed cocaine-related, and the more I could think about other times I felt the same way.\n\nSo, here is my background:\nI am from a neigbourhood called Piedade, in Rio de Janeiro. Born and raised there until I was 8/9 years old. I moved with my family around Brazil until I was 15, at which point we moved to Canada. \nRio is a dangerous (!!!), violent place. My neighbourhood was a favela. Not the worst one but a favela nevertheless. I can recall most nights falling asleep to the sounds of gunshots. I can\u2019t really recall the sound of gunshots nowadays until I hear one. I have been caught up in the line of fire quite a few times. Most of them were on the streets and we would just stay put in corners of the house. Some of them were while I was out on the streets and had to just scoot down in the car or run and hide inside nearby stores. One of my earliest memories is of me being woken up in a hurry by my parents. They just grabbed me and my brother and took us to the bathroom. Our doors and windows were gridded and someone \u2014 or in my memory as a child, something scary \u2014 was banging on them. I honestly don\u2019t remember much of that anymore.
