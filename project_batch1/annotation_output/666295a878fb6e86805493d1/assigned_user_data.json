As a kid I used to love horse riding, so so much. I went to a prestigious equestrian school twice a week and did everything from hacking, to showjumping, to novice dressage. I got decent enough that I was really comfortable in the saddle. I loved going cantering because of the thrill, and I had confidence dealing with horses that spooked or acted difficult.\n\nHowever, one day when I was twelve I fell from horse during a showjumping event. It was a horse hadn't ridden much and wasn't used to its mannerisms. I later discovered I'd broken my coccyx (tailbone) and was in pain for weeks afterwards but because I immediately got back on the horse after the fall and continued to ride for bit, I wasn't too shaken up about it.\n\nAbout a month later, my parents were looking into buying a horse for me and we thought we'd finally found a good beginner horse. The owners seemed to think this horse was a good match, however, upon riding the horse I discovered that it was extremely flighty. It didn't listen to me at all and would just bolt off in random directions at a full gallop no matter how hard I tried to pull it back. At this point, I started to panic. I didn't like feeling like I wasn't in control of the animal. Eventually it threw me off, hard. I was okay, but determined to see if I could control this horse, I got on again. This was a mistake. The second time it threw me off at a full gallop (around 60km/h) and I landed on my head. I had a bad concussion and couldn't see properly. I also had severe neckpain similar to a whiplash-type injury. I was also very very traumatised by what had happened. I felt paralysed by fear.\n\nAfter recovering from my physical injuries, I attempted to resume riding lessons but this failed. I couldn't be atop a horse for more than five minutes without breaking down in tears. Every moment I spent on horseback was pure terror, even with sound horses I'd known for years. Nothing seemed to help. My instructor began to get very frustrated with me, and this made me hate myself even more. Eventually my mum sent me to therapy where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Though the therapy was useful and I found myself unwilling to get on a horse again. My experienced had permanently turned me off horses.\n\nSo now I'm in my twenties, and considering revisiting the possibility of riding in a controlled environment with very sound horses. Although I don't think I still have PTSD (in that I no longer have nightmares or flashbacks) I am still suffering from a kind of trauma that I wish to heal. On the one hand I'm terrified of getting on a horse again, on the other hand I don't think there's any other way to put this behind me. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR: Had PTSD from falling off a horse and now almost a decade later I'm considering riding again.", "displayed_text": "Unresolved Childhood PTSD from a near-death experience Hi there,\n\nSo this might be a bit of lengthy ramble, but bear with me.

I didn't like feeling like I wasn't in control of the animal. Eventually it threw me off, hard. I was okay, but determined to see if I could control this horse, I got on again. This was a mistake. The second time it threw me off at a full gallop (around 60km/h) and I landed on my head. I had a bad concussion and couldn't see properly. I also had severe neckpain similar to a whiplash-type injury. I was also very very traumatised by what had happened. I felt paralysed by fear.\n\nAfter recovering from my physical injuries, I attempted to resume riding lessons but this failed. I couldn't be atop a horse for more than five minutes without breaking down in tears. Every moment I spent on horseback was pure terror, even with sound horses I'd known for years. Nothing seemed to help. My instructor began to get very frustrated with me, and this made me hate myself even more. Eventually my mum sent me to therapy where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Though the therapy was useful and I found myself unwilling to get on a horse again. My experienced had permanently turned me off horses.\n\nSo now I'm in my twenties, and considering revisiting the possibility of riding in a controlled environment with very sound horses. Although I don't think I still have PTSD (in that I no longer have nightmares or flashbacks) I am still suffering from a kind of trauma that I wish to heal. On the one hand I'm terrified of getting on a horse again, on the other hand I don't think there's any other way to put this behind me. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR: Had PTSD from falling off a horse and now almost a decade later I'm considering riding again."}, "1526_counseling": {"id": "1526_counseling", "text": "I am so sorry to hear you are going through this.
