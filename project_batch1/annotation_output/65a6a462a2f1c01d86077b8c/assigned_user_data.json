I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his \"voice\". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend \"Jay's\" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.\n\nThe next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with \"Jay\". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.\n\nBack when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. \n\n\n\nI knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. \n\n\nEarlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a \"shooting in the woods\" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. \n\nAnd then this happened.\n\nI'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.\n\nI don't expect any advice really.

It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend \"Jay's\" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.\n\nThe next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with \"Jay\". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.\n\nBack when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. \n\n\n\nI knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. \n\n\nEarlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a \"shooting in the woods\" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. \n\nAnd then this happened.\n\nI'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.\n\nI don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know."}, "1788_counseling": {"id": "1788_counseling", "text": "My boyfriend shows affection, but I just push him away.

He is incredibly abusive. Emotionally and mentally, and has not done anything physically but I think he would be capable of it. \n\nI have a chronic illness and was undiagnosed for a very long time. He thought I was lying. So he wouldn\u2019t let me ice me joint and would tell me I was weak. Eventually I believed him. I still do to an extent. There are numerous other abusive things that would happen. \n\nBut I never considered myself a trauma victim. I already thought \u201ceveryone else has it worse\u201d. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I do have a therapist, but I never told him about any of the stuff with my biodad. I had convinced myself that I was over reacting and everything was fine. \n\nRecently, right before lockdown I met this great guy. I have issues around men (not I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s because my biodad always intimidated me) so I told him that before we started dating. He was really sweet about it. I explained that if he yelled I would completely break down and if we have an argument, it wouldn\u2019t help. Our relationship has progressed and one night I was really having an awful night. \n\nCouldn\u2019t sleep and I had some really bad flashback like nightmares. He called me and we chatted on the phone for a bit. After talking and me apologizing for talking about stuff. I said \u201cI don\u2019t get why it effects me. It\u2019s not like I was abused. I wasn\u2019t traumatized\u201d and he said \u201cI think you were. You\u2019re having a trauma response and you deserve help. You deserve to be able to tell people. He hurt you really badly and you\u2019re allowed to not feel okay\u201d\n\nAnd then it all kinda clicked?

Okay so it\u2019s completely fine if nobody reads this or responds. I just need to put it out in the world somewhere. \n\nHere some background. My biodad is a narcissistic sociopath. He is incredibly abusive. Emotionally and mentally, and has not done anything physically but I think he would be capable of it. \n\nI have a chronic illness and was undiagnosed for a very long time. He thought I was lying. So he wouldn\u2019t let me ice me joint and would tell me I was weak. Eventually I believed him. I still do to an extent. There are numerous other abusive things that would happen. \n\nBut I never considered myself a trauma victim. I already thought \u201ceveryone else has it worse\u201d. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I do have a therapist, but I never told him about any of the stuff with my biodad. I had convinced myself that I was over reacting and everything was fine. \n\nRecently, right before lockdown I met this great guy. I have issues around men (not I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s because my biodad always intimidated me) so I told him that before we started dating. He was really sweet about it. I explained that if he yelled I would completely break down and if we have an argument, it wouldn\u2019t help. Our relationship has progressed and one night I was really having an awful night. \n\nCouldn\u2019t sleep and I had some really bad flashback like nightmares. He called me and we chatted on the phone for a bit. After talking and me apologizing for talking about stuff. I said \u201cI don\u2019t get why it effects me. It\u2019s not like I was abused. I wasn\u2019t traumatized\u201d and he said \u201cI think you were. You\u2019re having a trauma response and you deserve help. You deserve to be able to tell people. He hurt you really badly and you\u2019re allowed to not feel okay\u201d\n\nAnd then it all kinda clicked?

I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door.

If I ever met someone that didn\u2019t scare me, I KNEW they must have been a good person, because that NEVER happened! It wasn\u2019t until I turned 30 that I went to a therapist and started to deal with what happened to me. I am finally living a somewhat normal life. I still have many fears, but I don\u2019t spend everyday terrified of life and things that COULD happen. For that I am very thankful!", "displayed_text": "I spent my life terrified of my own shadow...and no one but myself knew why I was sexually abused for years as a young girl, ages 8-10.
