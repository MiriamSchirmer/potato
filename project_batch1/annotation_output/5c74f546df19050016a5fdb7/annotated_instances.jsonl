{"id": "1524_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD from forced sex work A bit of background here - I (29 F) was heavily involved in the drug scene back in my early twenties. Prior to that, in high school, I was very promiscuous (possibly as a result of taking medication meant for depression while actually being bipolar, perhaps sending me into a mania).\n\nIn my drug phase, there were lots of times I\u2019d have sex for drugs. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t expect it - thinking that I could just pay the guy for my drugs like a normal transaction, but they ended up not wanting the money and I\u2019d give in. \n\nthe climax of it all happened when I was desperately looking for a fix and this guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help. I got in the car (I know, stupid as hell) and he ended up getting me a handful of pills. I didn\u2019t know what they were, but I downed all of them. I passed out and then when I woke up, we were hundreds of miles away from where we originally met and he proceeds to explain to me that I\u2019m \u201cgoing to be working for him now\u201d. He was a pimp. \n\nI spent the next few weeks in that situation - he took my cell phone, kept me drugged up, woke me up at 8am everyday to start working until the late hours of night. He\u2019d yell at me if I had any bruises from someone being too rough with me. \n\nI had tried to kill my self then, but it didn\u2019t work and woke up to him screaming at me about it.\n\nThe only way I was able to contact anyone was when I had developed an infection in my arm from IV drug use and he finally (after days of this) agreed to take me to the ER. I called my family from there and thankfully he agreed to just drop me off at the airport where they would pick me up.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about this many times in counseling, but it\u2019s always been like I was talking about the weather. No emotion behind it, just nonchalantly telling the story.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until very recently that I thought about the whole situation and realized that I had been kidnapped. That yes, I was looking for drugs and that was bad, but I was kidnapped and taken captive and used.\n\nSince this realization, I\u2019ve been having flashbacks, especially during sex. And having sex is a whole different can of worms for me - lots of times, my body doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything. It\u2019s like I\u2019m still in prostitution mode, where I act like I\u2019m enjoying it but really can\u2019t wait for it to be over. The only way I can get off is by imagining my partner having sex with other people - it\u2019s like I can\u2019t allow myself and my own body to experience pleasure. Imagining things like that make me feel like a creep and it takes\nsomething that\u2019s supposed to be intimate and skews it into this fucked up thing.\n\n\nLast night, I felt it came to a head. I was having sex with my boyfriend and just began having flashbacks of my time as a prostitute - seeing images of guys putting money on the table, disassociating from my body and I then felt this sensation of such anger that I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted to bit my boyfriend across the face, scratch him, grab his face hard. I feel so terrible about it. I started crying and then of course that ruined the moment and the poor guy had no idea what was going through my head.\n\nHe knows some of what I\u2019ve been through, but there\u2019s so much he doesn\u2019t know and doesn\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t blame him. \n\n\nI want to enjoy sex again. I\u2019m seeing a therapist and am on medication for bipolar, but this shit just haunts me. I can\u2019t tell if I actually enjoy sex or just default to prostitute mode where i make all the sounds and motions of enjoying something, like I\u2019m acting and playing the part. \n\nDoes anyone else have similar stories that they can offer advice about? I\u2019m in such a low spot. I\u2019ve been contemplating suicide for feeling like such a burden.\n\nTL, DR: past trauma affecting relationships - help?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 633, "end": 1473, "span": "his guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help.

It\u2019s kind of hard for me to find anyone to talk to besides my therapist about this, because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same feelings as when someone goes through this and their loved one actually does pass. \n\nA brief summary of what happened: The day after Thanksgiving I ended up convincing my boyfriend to go to the urgent care for a pain in his side that he\u2019d been feeling for a few weeks but had gotten to the point where he was having pain with every breath he took. We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn\u2019t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He\u2019s not able to workout because he\u2019s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. \n\nI was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.\n\nI feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn\u2019t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he\u2019s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It\u2019s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...\n\nNot to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing. It\u2019s just so much to deal with all at once and I just feel so alone like no one else can understand what I\u2019m going through.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 48, "span": "PTSD from boyfriend of 5 years almost dying...

Sexual abuse TRIGGER WARNING\n\nHello, I haven't used my Reddit for quite some time now and I've been having a crazy week filled with nightmares every night. So, instead of walking out of my room and speaking or texting my mom or someone who has a common past trauma thing... I post here while crying my face off alone in my bedroom trying to cry quietly so no one hears me. \n\nI close my eyes after sitting for twenty minutes saying to myself that I can't think of those things over and over. The moment my eyes shut I see a few scenes from my childhood. One of which surfaced after not showing it's face for quite a few years. I sat up horrified and had to refrain from screaming. I thought I had forgotten it after all this time. Nope. Of course not. I never forget that shit. \n\nBehind my eyelids I saw my brother digging up something fuzzy and lumpy from the ground in the forest right by my grandmother's house.\n I feel sick just typing this but here it goes. On the shovel there were bones and a larger lump came up and I saw the fur of an animal. I was an extremely gullible child who had followed my brother and it took me till seeing the fur to realize this is where we had buried our cat Smokey. A Siamese who I loved with all my heart and had to be put down because of a rare condition I was told was passed down from his mother. I don't know the truth but I'll just pray that's it. \n\nI immediately starting crying after the realizing it was my Smokey and ran crying to my mom after having my life threatened if I told. I don't even remember if I told her. That's sad. I hope I did. The movie behind my eyelids starts as fast as it started when I close my eyes for a second time. \n\nThe instant it starts I see me and my brother hidden under my bunk. Me with my pants down cringing at something my eyes won't show me. I'm so thankful that is a blurred thing to see. In this scene I always remember my grandmother walking in the room and realizing we are under the bed together. I had prayed and prayed to a god I don't believe in that my grandmother would take him away from the same room and whoop his ass and cuff him but it was never spoken of... I don't even remember how old I was, my school counselor narrowed my trauma to starting age five. I guess she had talked to my mom over the phone about the apartment I described to her. Middle school was the last time anyone spoke of those things.\n\nI am not the best at typing on this broken phone. I thought that typing here would somehow help me if I got my story, well a fraction of it, out there into the atmosphere.. this is only a snippet of the horrors I lived through while around my brother. My dad to this day tries to win him over and loves him so much and my mother has him under her wing at all times. No one talks about that shit. Everyone loves him so much while I sit here sleepless half the time over the torture I've lived. He probably sleeps soundly every night of his disgusting life.

He groomed me from a teenager mental health fourn and he was 18. He visited me on his way to a Europe vacation and gave me my first kiss, I wanted to wait to kiss and he just forced it. He wanted a BJ so bad but I said no and he was so mad. We saw a play and he was just grumpy and mean. I went to visit him in his state and I loved his family but he would demand BJs. He asked if he needed to get condoms but I said I didnt want to have sex. I was on my period too so I think its why he didnt do more to me. I always wanted to go to Sedona and Lowell Observatory and he took me there on our trip but he locked me in the hotel room, we never went to the observatory or even Lowell. He made me grind/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said \"but think about how id feel\" and pushed me down. He grinded into me and I felt himself kinda push in trough my underwear and I felt scared. I went home and we broke up a few months later after he moved to Germany and I just set my relationship as with someone else to get him to leave me cause I kept trying but hed make me feel bad ( I was 18 and dumb...) \n\nI only told my twin but never my mom. She would NEVER understand.  I had another abusive bf this year (23 years old) and he was VERY misogynist. Like an incel. He hid it and it came out later on. He knew of my PTSD and all his rape jokes made me freak out and cry. He said the last time we fooled around he would cover my mouth and ignore me saying no and I freaked out idk why hed say that and I left a few weeks later. \n\nI now am seeing a new guy, but hes 100% diff than anyone. We were bffs. Hes sensitive, kind, funny, sweet, very dorky and very loving in his heart. He feels like the boy me. He is very sexually intelligent and patient. After my trauma at 18 I decided I want to wait till marriage so I never ever have to have sex with someone who I wouldn't regret. After my incel ex I feel it even more the way he changed and warped. My current bf knows this he knows everything and he is fine with it. His last ex they never had sex for their whole 5 years and he said he has dated many virgins and waited till they were ready. All his close friends say he truly is a great man. Hes a unicorn haha. \n\nI really want to fool around with him more but I am very scared Ill freak out. I cant masturbate without him and I feel like a WHORE doing it alone cause of my past. I just want to be normal. I want to just have happy sexual experiences with my bf. I know he can give me them the way he is but Im scared ill make them bad. I just want to be normal. Therapy is so slow and its such few and far between where I make milestones in anything at all!! How does this go away?! I manage my OCD, my anxiety is improving but PTSD never goes away. I hate it. I want to cry. I was only 18 why did me make me do all that stuff. I didnt want too. I feel like a disguting slut I want to punch my legs till they are black and blue. I hate myself for what I let happen to me and the fear it makes me have.

I\u2019m new to this sub reddit.\n\n\nI\u2019m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. \nI totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn\u2019t do anything. \nI had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn\u2019t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don\u2019t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.\nI\u2019m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can\u2019t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can\u2019t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. \nI also watched the worst accident I\u2019ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I\u2019d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn\u2019t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn\u2019t ok to drive. \nSo.. yea. I don\u2019t really know where I was going with this, I guess I\u2019m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they\u2019re doing better now. \nI don\u2019t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can\u2019t even do those things.\nI\u2019m trying so hard.

i was at pride for the first time ever. my parents aren't all that supportive of the LGBT community so it took me years to find the courage to go. we were one block over from the main event because we wanted to get food and suddenly a guy runs by and yells \"don't go that way\" but we don't see anything so we keep walking and suddenly a flood of people is running towards us and yelling \"RUN\" so we start running and we get caught in this stampede and there's people falling and tripping and suddenly i hear a loud noise and i've grown up around guns so i don't really scare easy but this sounded exactly like a gun shot and i've never run faster in my life and then we're ushered into this building and there's maybe fifty people crammed in and people including adults are crying and holding

we didn't know what was going on. i have no regard for my personal safety so i ran outside to find a cop and all i hear is \"gun in custody, no dead, people injured\" so as i'm running back into the building a second wave of people starts running and i barely make it back into the building before getting trampled and there's even more people and two girls are having massive panic attacks and there was no cell service and the news wasn't updating on anything so we didn't have any information on what was happening and nobody would say anything and there were a bunch of cops outside but for an hour we were in a complete communications blackout and i thought there was a shooter and i was going to die. when i got home and i was in service i found out that there was a fight and somebody whipped out a gun and chaos ensued. i really didn't feel anything while it was happening. my hands weren't shaking at all and when i got home i couldn't even cry but today i was at the pool and walking in and outside there was chalk on the ground that said \"RUN\" and my stomach immediately dropped for no real reason and then inside there were people playing water polo and they missed the goal and the ball made the same sound i heard when i was running yesterday and after i left i got in my car and i just started crying for ten minutes. afterwards i was out with my friend and some kids ran past us and again my stomach just dropped and i was back in that moment. we saw a movie and this guy kept walking in and out of the theater and all i could think about was how there was nowhere to hide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat's my story. i feel like i'm just overreacting because there wasn't actually a shooter and so many other people actually have lived through shootings so in comparison this was nothing. i just don't know how to feel about all of this. i'm alternating between feeling absolutely nothing, like now as i'm typing this, and complete anxiety and crying. i know i should talk to a therapist but there's none covered by insurance in my area and my old therapist was really expensive. i'll have access to a counselor for free in college but i don't know if i can live like

Tw: childhood sexual abuse &amp; neglect Long story short, the sexual abuse happened around 4-5 years of age and the emotional neglect went on for over a decade after. I have amnesia from the sexual trauma, but am currently dealing with crippling night terrors that are confusing me as to what I thought happened. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re flashbacks, I know they\u2019re dreams, but they\u2019re traumatic in themselves because of the disgusting images I\u2019m left with when I wake up. It\u2019s horrifying and overwhelming. \n\nI recently made huge headway in therapy and have finally learned to stop dissociating/going numb, something I\u2019ve done for my entire life. Now that I can feel, I\u2019m drowned in emotion, sadness, anger, hurt, but that\u2019s good because I\u2019m finally really feeling everything. It\u2019s the not being able to calm myself down and help myself feel safe again that\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m going to see a psychiatrist to see if I can get meds for the chronic nightmares (it\u2019s been an entire year now), but in the meantime I don\u2019t know how to calm myself when I\u2019m emotionally overwhelmed. No one taught me how to properly soothe myself and all I\u2019ve ever known is resorting to numbness. \n\nSo here\u2019s my question, friends: how do you self soothe when you\u2019re overwhelmed and can\u2019t stop sobbing?
