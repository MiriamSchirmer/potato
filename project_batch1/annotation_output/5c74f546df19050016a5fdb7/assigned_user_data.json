We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn\u2019t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter.

Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.\n\nI feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now.

I feel like I should be happy now because he\u2019s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It\u2019s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...\n\nNot to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing.

I never forget that shit. \n\nBehind my eyelids I saw my brother digging up something fuzzy and lumpy from the ground in the forest right by my grandmother's house.\n I feel sick just typing this but here it goes. On the shovel there were bones and a larger lump came up and I saw the fur of an animal. I was an extremely gullible child who had followed my brother and it took me till seeing the fur to realize this is where we had buried our cat Smokey. A Siamese who I loved with all my heart and had to be put down because of a rare condition I was told was passed down from his mother. I don't know the truth but I'll just pray that's it. \n\nI immediately starting crying after the realizing it was my Smokey and ran crying to my mom after having my life threatened if I told. I don't even remember if I told her. That's sad. I hope I did. The movie behind my eyelids starts as fast as it started when I close my eyes for a second time. \n\nThe instant it starts I see me and my brother hidden under my bunk. Me with my pants down cringing at something my eyes won't show me. I'm so thankful that is a blurred thing to see. In this scene I always remember my grandmother walking in the room and realizing we are under the bed together. I had prayed and prayed to a god I don't believe in that my grandmother would take him away from the same room and whoop his ass and cuff him but it was never spoken of... I don't even remember how old I was, my school counselor narrowed my trauma to starting age five. I guess she had talked to my mom over the phone about the apartment I described to her. Middle school was the last time anyone spoke of those things.\n\nI am not the best at typing on this broken phone. I thought that typing here would somehow help me if I got my story, well a fraction of it, out there into the atmosphere.. this is only a snippet of the horrors I lived through while around my brother. My dad to this day tries to win him over and loves him so much and my mother has him under her wing at all times. No one talks about that shit. Everyone loves him so much while I sit here sleepless half the time over the torture I've lived. He probably sleeps soundly every night of his disgusting life. Having to wake up to my kids is the only reason I'm still here. Holy shit dude...."}, "2240_ptsd": {"id": "2240_ptsd", "text": "Fuck this loud fucking holiday.

He made me grind/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said \"but think about how id feel\" and pushed me down.

My partner gets concerned to trigger me, hes very slow and patient when we discuss sex.

We were bffs. Hes sensitive, kind, funny, sweet, very dorky and very loving in his heart. He feels like the boy me. He is very sexually intelligent and patient. After my trauma at 18 I decided I want to wait till marriage so I never ever have to have sex with someone who I wouldn't regret. After my incel ex I feel it even more the way he changed and warped. My current bf knows this he knows everything and he is fine with it. His last ex they never had sex for their whole 5 years and he said he has dated many virgins and waited till they were ready. All his close friends say he truly is a great man. Hes a unicorn haha. \n\nI really want to fool around with him more but I am very scared Ill freak out. I cant masturbate without him and I feel like a WHORE doing it alone cause of my past. I just want to be normal. I want to just have happy sexual experiences with my bf. I know he can give me them the way he is but Im scared ill make them bad. I just want to be normal. Therapy is so slow and its such few and far between where I make milestones in anything at all!! How does this go away?! I manage my OCD, my anxiety is improving but PTSD never goes away. I hate it. I want to cry. I was only 18 why did me make me do all that stuff. I didnt want too. I feel like a disguting slut I want to punch my legs till they are black and blue. I hate myself for what I let happen to me and the fear it makes me have. My partner gets concerned to trigger me, hes very slow and patient when we discuss sex. Being a virgin I ask him questions and he never laughs at me like other people do he just explains stuff kindly and sweetly. No pressure no meanness. I feel like a dirty mean bad person. I want to talk to him but hes also stressed at work today and I feel so mean. My therapist is on vacation cause of Jewish holidays :(  idk..\n\nIdk....i just want it to go away already its been TOO MANY YEARS!!"}, "1516_ptsd": {"id": "1516_ptsd", "text": "Constant break ups My ex of 2 years broke up with me over 30 times in 2 years.
