The \"leader\" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like \"You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?\". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending \"laugh\" like \"Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.\n2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.\n3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry.

Over the past 2 years, I've been suffering from what at times felt time paralyzing ptsd that I couldn't escape. I'm in Mountain Rescue, and over the past two years I've had missions with nothing but fatalities. The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury. None the less, it was traumatic and recently I started getting anxious and irritable.\n\nToday I got a mission call out for a missing 7 year old girl who went missing at their families camping vacation last night. Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out \"fuck yes\" after I heard on the radio \"we've made contact!\". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. \n\nI'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help. However in the end, I feel like I was given a gift, and a chance to start over and keep my passion for helping others going. I know that many of you on here are in a rut or hole and feel like you cant get out, but please, don't give up. You never know when you might get your chance to rebuild like I did today.

Over the past 2 years, I've been suffering from what at times felt time paralyzing ptsd that I couldn't escape. I'm in Mountain Rescue, and over the past two years I've had missions with nothing but fatalities. The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury. None the less, it was traumatic and recently I started getting anxious and irritable.\n\nToday I got a mission call out for a missing 7 year old girl who went missing at their families camping vacation last night. Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out \"fuck yes\" after I heard on the radio \"we've made contact!\". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. \n\nI'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help. However in the end, I feel like I was given a gift, and a chance to start over and keep my passion for helping others going.
