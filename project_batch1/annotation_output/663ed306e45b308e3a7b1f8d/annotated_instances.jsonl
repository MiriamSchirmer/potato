I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"new version\" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year.

I had a group of friends since 2004, and remained friends with them up until 2014 when I finally cut communications with them. They were a very toxic group of racist, sexist, and narcissistic people. The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. \n\n1. The \"leader\" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like \"You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?\". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending \"laugh\" like \"Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.\n2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.\n3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.\n4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like \"go kill yourself no one loves you\"\n5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.\n6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life. He was the only one I kept in more recent contact, but I noticed some of his personality traits were very similar to the group.  He would do the same mocking laugh the leader did, the same type of criticism that the leader's favorite and the white supremecist did. And at a recent party, I found out he was trying to hit on girlfriends of my friends, and made a lot of people uncomfortable. After realizing all this, I realized he is just as bad as that old group and I cut him off.\n\nOver 5 years have passed since then, and I still think about this.

At one point I lost sight of 2 people and thought they had died because I was going too slow. They ended up surviving, one with permanent damage to a few organs. I have these terrible nightmares multiple times a week where if I mess something up, myself or someone else dies. I wake up with really hard reflexes, like a huge jump or a swing, in a cold sweat. I feel super inadequate though. The people around me who have trauma have it from combat, and I have it from being on the phone. I didn't even swim out there. I know it would have been worse if the coast guard hadn't come and everything but I feel guilty about it every single day. This was months ago, and I don't go a single day without feeling guilty either because I didn't go fast enough or because I didn't go out to help. Does anyone know any resources, especially free military specific ones that could help me out? I have to talk to my chaplain still. It's embarrassing to me to get help for it though. I feel like I don't have the right or something.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 304, "end": 336, "span": "where a few people were drowning", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 40s "}}

You have to not be in the position to do anything sinful at all even though if you had the chance to sin you would. That makes the bible completely retarded and judgement also if god does not take this into consideration. Like sending some fat, one eyed incel to heaven for an eternity of happiness only because he wasn't able to act out on having sex, perhaps he also wanted to kill people like hitler but couldn't due to not being in his position? Or something else horrible that he would 100% do but is unable to. Heaven and hell is a complete joke and when you die its over.

{"id": "2011_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Feel like I started my life again today. Over the past 2 years, I've been suffering from what at times felt time paralyzing ptsd that I couldn't escape. I'm in Mountain Rescue, and over the past two years I've had missions with nothing but fatalities. The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury. None the less, it was traumatic and recently I started getting anxious and irritable.\n\nToday I got a mission call out for a missing 7 year old girl who went missing at their families camping vacation last night. Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out \"fuck yes\" after I heard on the radio \"we've made contact!\". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. \n\nI'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help. However in the end, I feel like I was given a gift, and a chance to start over and keep my passion for helping others going. I know that many of you on here are in a rut or hole and feel like you cant get out, but please, don't give up. You never know when you might get your chance to rebuild like I did today. I can't say that tomorrow I will be fixed and everything will be better, but I know that today was a milestone, and my path has changed for the better. I hope that you too get that chance to improve your path soon.\n\nLove you all and stay strong.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 89, "end": 151, "span": "what at times felt time paralyzing ptsd that I couldn't escape", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 323, "end": 380, "span": "the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}
{"id": "1401_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I think I have an episode of PTSD. Help is appreciated. Hello.\nI live in a very unsafe country. I grew accustomed somehow to the hazardous risk of my daily life (due to rampant deliquency) and fortunately, due to my residence in an upscale neighborhood, I haven't been really that exposed to the real face of danger.\nNonetheless, tonight, while scrolling down the timeline on Twitter, I came across this gory video of a young man (way too young, a teenager) been brutally beheaded after what looks like a horribly agonizing execution.\nIt seems it was the by-product of mafia wars but it occured in my home country, fortunately, far away from the capitol city.\nHowever, the video shocked me so much that I can't really think of other things now. I'm really paranoid now that someone could break into my house and subject me to such a dreadful death. I'm paranoid about the domestic employee (from a poor side of the city) to gang up with others to assault on me in order to steal from me or something like that. It got to the point that I felt like throwing up at least a good half an hour after watching the video.\n\nI have never considered myself sensitive to this kind of material. Actually I had watched several of them in the past but this one really hit home. \n\nI believe the paranoid thoughts (which I never had) and feeling unsafe for my dog and myself (due to a good part of the population being deprived of proper food and healthcare) are an episode of PTSD.\n\nI want to thank all of the police officers, especially those fighting organized-crime for the daunting risk they take on our behalf. I believe that for the first time ever I understand how they expose their relatives and families and I really want to express my gratitude.\n\nTHank you very much for reading this and any help is appreciated.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 386, "end": 536, "span": " I came across this gory video of a young man (way too young, a teenager) been brutally beheaded after what looks like a horribly agonizing execution.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 837, "end": 851, "span": "dreadful death", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 925, "end": 1013, "span": "to gang up with others to assault on me in order to steal from me or something like that", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}
