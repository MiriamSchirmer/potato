It starts with visible agitation and anxiety, which quickly progresses to becoming argumentative and aggressive and eventually be completely unable to listen to logic or follow any train of thought, mine or his. I spent years trying to talk things over or find any way to pacify him in those moments, but I generally found that once I realized what was happening, he was too far gone and too far into victim mode, and any words that came out of my mouth would just end up getting twisted and make things worse. \n\nOf course, one of his big triggers is abandonment issues, so as soon as I start to realize that he\u2019s in that place and try to extricate myself from the situation, it tends to escalate things.

Animals love him. I have never met someone more kind, more attuned to my needs and understanding of my feelings. He has the most healing hands, he can take away the most debilitating pain with a simple head massage (I get the type of menstrual cramps that leave me screaming and throwing up on the bathroom floor).\n\nAnd yet - every now and then he leaves and in his place there is a man who is my nightmare. I know that at this point I have my own trauma to deal with from these nights. He\u2019s never hurt me and I\u2019m generally not physically frightened, but he has punched a few holes in the wall and there have been bad nights where he uses his size (we have a 14-inch, 100-lb difference) to try and stop me from leaving his house, towering over me and getting obvious pleasure from intimidating me, physically holding my car door closed so I cannot leave, or getting into my car with me and refusing to get out.\n\nI feel stupid as I write this, I feel like every stereotype of a girl blinded by love. \n\nMaybe I just needed to vent, or see this all written out.

On top of this there is a history of depression in her family, which she seems to have inherited, so her moods can be very dark even when she's not triggered. It's hard to know what's what she's suffering from.\n\nShe's been trying different anti-depressants since she was 19, when she started having trouble with school. About 2 years ago she admitted to being suicidal after her previous relationship ended(we had met but weren't a couple yet). She was taken in and seen by a panel of psychiatrists/doctors who asked her loads of questions and then released her, not really doing anything or giving her any info - she says it was a horrible experience. Her family doctor has sent her to a few different specialists since, all who do an interview with her before bouncing her back to family doctor saying they're not qualified. \n\nThe most recent doctor, a CBT specialist, listened to her about how fed up she was with the lack of progress, he looked through her previous files and interviewed some of the professionals she'd previously seen and was able to find that she'd been given a PTSD diagnosis, which is a step in the right direction, but as a CBT specialist he's not qualified for PTSD so he shunted her back to her doctor.

Last summer, after a family event/argument led to domestic violence at home, I decided to move out of the house, where I was living with my twin brother. He had suffered from depression for most of his life, but towards the end, he became increasingly violent and manic. I was scared, and confused, and did what I thought was best for me and my partner at the time, and moved down the street to a new apt. The next day, after working, and not hearing from him, I started to get a sick feeling in my stomach. I ignored it for a few hours, drinking water and laying down, but the sick feeling grew into something else that I can\u2019t describe. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard stories of twins sensing each other, especially in times of distress. It\u2019s rare, but I\u2019m telling you, that shit is very real. So I walked over to our house, and he didn\u2019t answer the door. It was a Tuesday night. He was 32. We were 32.\n\nMy actual experience is something too horrible and sad to describe in detail, but I did find him, and I\u2019m the one who went in, and raised him up, and took him off of that rope. That tangible, physical experience, mixed with the tragedy of losing my twin brother, my best friend, who I spent my entire childhood with, has left me deeply traumatized. There\u2019s an element to it that took part of my identity itself, as a twin, I\u2019m now now longer part of a set. I\u2019m half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How do I continue to be a twin without my match? Is a set still a set, once you apply subtraction? Am I still a twin now that he is gone?\n\nMy trauma experience is a nightmare, literally. My dreams manifest things I don\u2019t even want to go into, and I\u2019ve never been so aware of how many times suicide is mentioned in films, television, even comedy. It\u2019s everywhere, and the suicide rates among young people are at unprecedented levels. My triggers induce a deep breath in me, at the mention of the word, or image, or a roped off front yard, Dad attempting to make the grass grow. Or a bread tie. Or a dog collar. It\u2019s weird how things manifest like that. Unfortunately the mystery leaves me vulnerable to crying episodes in public, or leaving social gatherings early, and unannounced. I attempted to continue to suck it up, and be social, but my loss made me nervous, confused, empty. It left me empty. But, like the dry chalice might be considered to be empty, perhaps the purpose of the chalice, is to be filled. And so it flows into me...\n\nIt taught me to see truth a little clearer, but this has been hard. Truth requires self reflection first, self truth, whatever that means to you. I had to look hard at myself in order to deal with my grief and my guilt, and I know I\u2019ll struggle to understand these issues for the rest of my life. I\u2019ve been writing and reading about suicide, bipolar disorder (which he had), consciousness, empathy, truth, friendships, spirituality, and sorrow to try to process all of this. \n\nI never could have imagined being in this place, on this island. At first, many were supportive, but slowly I became more and more isolated, feeling like no one possibly could understand what I was going through. I slowly lost most of the people in my life, not because they didn\u2019t care, but because they didn\u2019t have the capacity to show it, they just didn\u2019t know how. Who could blame them? I was confrontational, angry, sad, confused, and hoping someone was going to make it better for me. But it wasn\u2019t about anyone else, if I was going to ever feel good again, it was going to be ME who made that happen. It\u2019s amazing how everything can turn on a dime, and never return. It\u2019s like, when he died, he took this..  thing... from me. What it is, I can\u2019t name, but it\u2019s gone for sure, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not coming back. So what do I do with it, this emptiness? I walk with it. Literally. I walk and walk the trails on this island all day. It\u2019s winter now, so it\u2019s much colder, and my walks are filled with less pauses, but I persist. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy, sometimes several times a week. I do not consume alcohol or hard drugs. I use particular psychedelics with a therapeutic intent, and have experienced profound revelations that have been helpful in moving my mind in a more conscious and positive direction. I take natural herbal supplements for energy and mood balancing, but I find that exercising in a natural environment is the best thing for me therapeutically. I\u2019m lucky to be young enough to be so mobile. \n\nI\u2019ve slowly shed all social media, FB, IG, etc, because I found it to contribute to my anxiety, my isolation, and resentment. I was constantly trying to openly share, self examine, and had hopes that others would reciprocate. But people don\u2019t really want to do that. It\u2019s super uncomfortable, and most would rather be distracted by the game, or their phone, or a drink. Finally, after a point in which I felt like what I was saying fell on deaf ears, I decided to no longer share with those who couldn\u2019t hear it anymore. My therapist brought to mind the biblical concept \u201ccast ye your pearls before swine\u201d.  Of course I\u2019m not saying my words are gospel, and in fact, I offer no advice to anyone, this is all purely my experience and expression. \n\nIn fact, I\u2019m in distress a lot, and I\u2019m not saying that any of this made me a \u201cbetter person\u201d, I\u2019m saying it made me wake the fuck up to myself, and what I was doing. Things don\u2019t get easier, they just get different. Tragedy sometime can birth strength, but often times, tragic events do not make people better, stronger, or more aware, in fact it often makes us more disconnected, more isolated, feeling like we\u2019re unique, and our pain is unique. Victims of trauma can\u2019t be put into order in a filing cabinet, there\u2019s no sense to be made of it. Some are resentful of those thriving, saying \u201cthat\u2019s not my experience\u201d. Of course it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just yours. And this is just mine. And although my situation and personality are unique, I find my pain isn\u2019t. The whole world is suffering suffering. My pain might just disappear, like a drop becomes the ocean, in the great vastness of collective consciousness, if I can release myself of the burden through empathy. Might any of us be strong enough to let the ocean completely envelop us? \n\nSo it\u2019s been a few weeks now since I\u2019ve been free from Instagram and Facebook, and my urge to check a screen, my addiction to check in on these carefully manicured presentations of digital life, has faded. Leaving me again, more room to be filled with the good things I enjoy in life. Playing my guitar, and reading Melville in the bathtub, meditating outside, walking the sandy trails with the rabbits, listening to my favorite records, and most importantly, spending time with my loving and compassionate partner, who is the most selfless, understanding soul in my whole world. Without love, I would have perished along with my brother, but it\u2019s love that kept me alive, and keeps me going. If I can learn to love myself truly, I know I\u2019ll survive. \n\nI hope to someday find a way to have a PTSD service dog, although it seems unlikely, due to the cost of training one properly (about $20K). I absolutely love dogs, and I think about adopting one frequently, but again, it\u2019s so hard for me to initiate important things, I can\u2019t even imagine starting this process. A good friend of mine has a couple hounds who love me, and make me super happy, so sometimes, when I\u2019m really down, I just go lay on the floor over at his house, and let the dogs go to town licking me and climbing all over me. It\u2019s so sensational and wonderful, I smile just writing about it. A pure, simple, wholesome joy. \n\nI\u2019m not past the pain, I\u2019m just finding out better ways in which to navigate it. Some days, the seas are choppy, but at least the sails are full. The shores of the seas of my mental landscape, are lined by a great, \u201cmental forest\u201d. My twin brother was a great tree in my forest, and hard he fell, but that break in the canopy has given my forest new growth.

There exists only four years of my 30 year life not touched by trauma. \n\nA list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.\n\nExtreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.\n\n\nFainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I\u2019m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children\u2019s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)\n\n\nInsomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn\u2019t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. \n\n\nVivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it\u2019s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. \n\n\nSocial Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn\u2019t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)\n\n\nDepression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I\u2019m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn\u2019t make me sad or upset, it\u2019s not like I wanted those things because I don\u2019t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn\u2019t close to my dad but wasn\u2019t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn\u2019t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn\u2019t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)\n\n\nIrregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I\u2019m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)\n\n\nConcentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) \n\n\nA few other things I experienced but I don\u2019t feel like going into:\nEating disorders\nAlcohol and drug abuse \nPromiscuity \n\n\nAll of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I\u2019m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. \n\n\nJust now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns.", "displayed_text": "Everything but PTSD Up until my diagnosis this year, I had no idea why I was the way I was. There exists only four years of my 30 year life not touched by trauma. \n\nA list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.\n\nExtreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.\n\n\nFainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I\u2019m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children\u2019s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)\n\n\nInsomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn\u2019t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. \n\n\nVivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it\u2019s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. \n\n\nSocial Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23.
