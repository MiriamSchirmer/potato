The nightmare is always brief and is set exactly in my setting (my room, the hotel I\u2019m staying in, etc.) It\u2019s hard to call it a night mare because it occurs as I\u2019m waking from sleep, but in the moment it feels as though I\u2019m waking because of the thing happening in the nightmare. \n\nFor example, tonight I woke with a start and saw a man peeking his head into my bedroom. My door was ajar and I clearly saw a mans face, leaning over and peering into my room. I yelled out (actually yelled, I was awake at this point) \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d Or \u201cwho are you?\u201d I\u2019m not sure.

In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. \n\nAt 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. \n\nThe doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said \"what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?\" I said I didn't know what was wrong. \n\nAfter they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. \n\nThey discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a \"nasty fever\" and told me to rest for a few days.\n\nAt 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. \n\nPositive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.\n\nBeing septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. \n\nI returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). \n\nNow I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through.

I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. \n\nI constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that.
