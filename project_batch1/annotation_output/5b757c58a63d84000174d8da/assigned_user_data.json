Here are a few examples. \u00a0The counselor may determine that the client's needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with.  A person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed, it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue.  If that issue is outside the competence of the counselor, the counselor should look for alternatives, the most common of which would be to terminate and refer.  Beyond clinical issues, this could also come up around particular other related facts, such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues.  This could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client's issues. \u00a0Another reason for discharge (and possible referral) would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit.  No counselor is the right person to work with everyone.  If the right level of connection is not happening, the counselor will often look first at what they are doing, might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things don't seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work.  A similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations, not doing any agreed on work between sessions, showing up late or being really guarded in session. \u00a0The easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on.  While this is the easiest one to determine, it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end.  However, counselors know that this is part of the process.  They will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end.  This type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into.", "displayed_text": "There are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision.  Here are a few examples. \u00a0The counselor may determine that the client's needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with.  A person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed, it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue.  If that issue is outside the competence of the counselor, the counselor should look for alternatives, the most common of which would be to terminate and refer.  Beyond clinical issues, this could also come up around particular other related facts, such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues.  This could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client's issues. \u00a0Another reason for discharge (and possible referral) would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit.  No counselor is the right person to work with everyone.  If the right level of connection is not happening, the counselor will often look first at what they are doing, might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things don't seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work.  A similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations, not doing any agreed on work between sessions, showing up late or being really guarded in session. \u00a0The easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on.  While this is the easiest one to determine, it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end.  However, counselors know that this is part of the process.  They will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end.  This type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into."}, "1070_ptsd": {"id": "1070_ptsd", "text": "Why I have ptsd.. When I was in middle school, I was bullied a lot. Physically. I've been assaulted a few times from women when I was a teenager. I remember in 5th grade I got off the bus and two women jumped me, broke my nose and left me bloody.. a few months later another woman assaulted me at school, and would throw me against the locker(she was much older than me). I also got in multiple fights with people and I saw some fucked up shit like a cat getting ripped to shreds by my own dog.. After that I would see dead animals on the side of the road and break down in tears. I was a bully in school too. always built with rage. One time a kid jumped on my back and bit my shoulder and In response I body slammed him on the concrete because he freaked me out. I put him in the hospital and his dad threatened to kill me (I was 13, He was in his 40's). I was going to be charged with assault even though I was defending myself unless I wrote my bully a letter saying that I'm sorry. The reason I was in the wrong is because I'm a huge dude and he was half my size. It was fucking stupid. I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive. I left town when I was 18 and moved to Seattle, got a job at McDonald's and started therapy. I had a suicide attempt that same year and that put me in the hospital for a few weeks. I left my job at McDonald's a few weeks later, got a job at amazon and started making something of myself. But I struggle around people, I always have. My coping mechanism is painting, I'm an artist outside of work and it's something I care deeply about. I'm thinking of leaving Amazon to become an artist because that's what I want to do. I don't care if it's hard, I've had a lifetime of hardship so I know what hard is. Anyways this is more of a rant than an explanation. I had a very abusive childhood and it's made me have thick skin, It's why I am the man I am.. ", "displayed_text": "Why I have ptsd.. When I was in middle school, I was bullied a lot. Physically.
