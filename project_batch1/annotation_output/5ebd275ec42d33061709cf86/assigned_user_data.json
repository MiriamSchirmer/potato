Last summer, after a family event/argument led to domestic violence at home, I decided to move out of the house, where I was living with my twin brother. He had suffered from depression for most of his life, but towards the end, he became increasingly violent and manic. I was scared, and confused, and did what I thought was best for me and my partner at the time, and moved down the street to a new apt. The next day, after working, and not hearing from him, I started to get a sick feeling in my stomach. I ignored it for a few hours, drinking water and laying down, but the sick feeling grew into something else that I can\u2019t describe. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard stories of twins sensing each other, especially in times of distress. It\u2019s rare, but I\u2019m telling you, that shit is very real. So I walked over to our house, and he didn\u2019t answer the door. It was a Tuesday night. He was 32. We were 32.\n\nMy actual experience is something too horrible and sad to describe in detail, but I did find him, and I\u2019m the one who went in, and raised him up, and took him off of that rope. That tangible, physical experience, mixed with the tragedy of losing my twin brother, my best friend, who I spent my entire childhood with, has left me deeply traumatized. There\u2019s an element to it that took part of my identity itself, as a twin, I\u2019m now now longer part of a set. I\u2019m half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How do I continue to be a twin without my match? Is a set still a set, once you apply subtraction? Am I still a twin now that he is gone?\n\nMy trauma experience is a nightmare, literally. My dreams manifest things I don\u2019t even want to go into, and I\u2019ve never been so aware of how many times suicide is mentioned in films, television, even comedy. It\u2019s everywhere, and the suicide rates among young people are at unprecedented levels. My triggers induce a deep breath in me, at the mention of the word, or image, or a roped off front yard, Dad attempting to make the grass grow. Or a bread tie. Or a dog collar. It\u2019s weird how things manifest like that. Unfortunately the mystery leaves me vulnerable to crying episodes in public, or leaving social gatherings early, and unannounced. I attempted to continue to suck it up, and be social, but my loss made me nervous, confused, empty. It left me empty. But, like the dry chalice might be considered to be empty, perhaps the purpose of the chalice, is to be filled. And so it flows into me...\n\nIt taught me to see truth a little clearer, but this has been hard. Truth requires self reflection first, self truth, whatever that means to you. I had to look hard at myself in order to deal with my grief and my guilt, and I know I\u2019ll struggle to understand these issues for the rest of my life. I\u2019ve been writing and reading about suicide, bipolar disorder (which he had), consciousness, empathy, truth, friendships, spirituality, and sorrow to try to process all of this. \n\nI never could have imagined being in this place, on this island. At first, many were supportive, but slowly I became more and more isolated, feeling like no one possibly could understand what I was going through. I slowly lost most of the people in my life, not because they didn\u2019t care, but because they didn\u2019t have the capacity to show it, they just didn\u2019t know how. Who could blame them? I was confrontational, angry, sad, confused, and hoping someone was going to make it better for me. But it wasn\u2019t about anyone else, if I was going to ever feel good again, it was going to be ME who made that happen. It\u2019s amazing how everything can turn on a dime, and never return. It\u2019s like, when he died, he took this..  thing... from me. What it is, I can\u2019t name, but it\u2019s gone for sure, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not coming back. So what do I do with it, this emptiness? I walk with it. Literally. I walk and walk the trails on this island all day. It\u2019s winter now, so it\u2019s much colder, and my walks are filled with less pauses, but I persist. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy, sometimes several times a week. I do not consume alcohol or hard drugs. I use particular psychedelics with a therapeutic intent, and have experienced profound revelations that have been helpful in moving my mind in a more conscious and positive direction. I take natural herbal supplements for energy and mood balancing, but I find that exercising in a natural environment is the best thing for me therapeutically. I\u2019m lucky to be young enough to be so mobile. \n\nI\u2019ve slowly shed all social media, FB, IG, etc, because I found it to contribute to my anxiety, my isolation, and resentment. I was constantly trying to openly share, self examine, and had hopes that others would reciprocate. But people don\u2019t really want to do that. It\u2019s super uncomfortable, and most would rather be distracted by the game, or their phone, or a drink. Finally, after a point in which I felt like what I was saying fell on deaf ears, I decided to no longer share with those who couldn\u2019t hear it anymore. My therapist brought to mind the biblical concept \u201ccast ye your pearls before swine\u201d.  Of course I\u2019m not saying my words are gospel, and in fact, I offer no advice to anyone, this is all purely my experience and expression. \n\nIn fact, I\u2019m in distress a lot, and I\u2019m not saying that any of this made me a \u201cbetter person\u201d, I\u2019m saying it made me wake the fuck up to myself, and what I was doing. Things don\u2019t get easier, they just get different. Tragedy sometime can birth strength, but often times, tragic events do not make people better, stronger, or more aware, in fact it often makes us more disconnected, more isolated, feeling like we\u2019re unique, and our pain is unique. Victims of trauma can\u2019t be put into order in a filing cabinet, there\u2019s no sense to be made of it. Some are resentful of those thriving, saying \u201cthat\u2019s not my experience\u201d. Of course it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just yours. And this is just mine. And although my situation and personality are unique, I find my pain isn\u2019t. The whole world is suffering suffering. My pain might just disappear, like a drop becomes the ocean, in the great vastness of collective consciousness, if I can release myself of the burden through empathy. Might any of us be strong enough to let the ocean completely envelop us? \n\nSo it\u2019s been a few weeks now since I\u2019ve been free from Instagram and Facebook, and my urge to check a screen, my addiction to check in on these carefully manicured presentations of digital life, has faded. Leaving me again, more room to be filled with the good things I enjoy in life. Playing my guitar, and reading Melville in the bathtub, meditating outside, walking the sandy trails with the rabbits, listening to my favorite records, and most importantly, spending time with my loving and compassionate partner, who is the most selfless, understanding soul in my whole world. Without love, I would have perished along with my brother, but it\u2019s love that kept me alive, and keeps me going. If I can learn to love myself truly, I know I\u2019ll survive. \n\nI hope to someday find a way to have a PTSD service dog, although it seems unlikely, due to the cost of training one properly (about $20K). I absolutely love dogs, and I think about adopting one frequently, but again, it\u2019s so hard for me to initiate important things, I can\u2019t even imagine starting this process. A good friend of mine has a couple hounds who love me, and make me super happy, so sometimes, when I\u2019m really down, I just go lay on the floor over at his house, and let the dogs go to town licking me and climbing all over me. It\u2019s so sensational and wonderful, I smile just writing about it. A pure, simple, wholesome joy. \n\nI\u2019m not past the pain, I\u2019m just finding out better ways in which to navigate it. Some days, the seas are choppy, but at least the sails are full. The shores of the seas of my mental landscape, are lined by a great, \u201cmental forest\u201d. My twin brother was a great tree in my forest, and hard he fell, but that break in the canopy has given my forest new growth. Exotic species sprout from the sunlit patch spontaneously, and they invite me in, and we become one, and I enjoy the sun with them while I can. \n\nAre you in pain? I already love you.", "displayed_text": "Suffering Suffering, Losing My Twin Brother TLDR: Fill your well of sorrow with natural, wholesome joys.\n\nThis story is tragic, and I\u2019m omitting personal details for a lot of reasons, but my experience is, in sharing my story, that others have found solace.

Plus, my relationship with my mom hasn\u2019t been strong in the sense that I feel like she is always peering over my shoulder, and for good reasons. For instance, she read my diary when I was 14 and she found out other things about my personal life that led me to blaming myself and feeling guilty. when I was really young, I was exposed to things that gave me the impression that men sexualized women and it has made it difficult for me to trust men.
