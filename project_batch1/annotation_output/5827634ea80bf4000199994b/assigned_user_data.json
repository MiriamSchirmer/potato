No one in my family knows about what I\u2019ve been through\u2014my mom is actually still married to the man who abused me. I have told my current boyfriend about it as well as a few friends over the years but it has always been a secret. \n\nI perseverate on it daily and it has had an effect on every aspect of my life. I\u2019m happy I\u2019m making progress in addressing it in therapy and working on healing.\n\nHowever, I want to tell my brother and maybe my sister about it more than anything. My brother (27M) lives on his own and is fairly independent. However, like everyone else in my life, loves and respects my abuser (he is extremely charismatic). My sister (21F) is my abuser\u2019s daughter (we share the same mom though) and I often wonder if she was subjected to the same abuse I went through.

I\u2019ve been in therapy for a little over a month now and was finally told that I have PTSD from the sexual abuse I dealt with when I was a child. No one in my family knows about what I\u2019ve been through\u2014my mom is actually still married to the man who abused me. I have told my current boyfriend about it as well as a few friends over the years but it has always been a secret. \n\nI perseverate on it daily and it has had an effect on every aspect of my life. I\u2019m happy I\u2019m making progress in addressing it in therapy and working on healing.\n\nHowever, I want to tell my brother and maybe my sister about it more than anything. My brother (27M) lives on his own and is fairly independent. However, like everyone else in my life, loves and respects my abuser (he is extremely charismatic). My sister (21F) is my abuser\u2019s daughter (we share the same mom though) and I often wonder if she was subjected to the same abuse I went through. She deals with anxiety but seems to have a good relationship with him so I\u2019m really unsure. She also still lives at home so I don\u2019t want to put her in danger either. \n\nDoes anyone have experience telling people like their siblings about their abuse?

Hello humans, \n\nBelow is a non-graphic summary of my current predicament and I was hoping to gain some advice!\n\nI work in the live production world in general - concert/theatrical touring shows specifically - and I am 26 years old. This interest of mine began in high school when I had the opportunity to participate in our school's theater program for which I built sets, hung lights, and operated audio. This was also my first co-ed experience as from age 4 to 18 I went to an all girls school. To put on theater productions, however, we would work with the all boys school across the street. While I did well in theater back then, I was often ignored by the other students and teachers as they all came from the boys school and weren't sure how to interact with me... I think. Even when I became a vital participant in making productions happen, I kept to myself because I was also put off by the social dynamic of the boys.\n\nI pursued this in New York City where I went to college during which time being the only woman on a production crew was also the norm. In 2013 and 2015 respectively I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body. The earlier was while working at a music festival, the later was during an off campus Black Student Union event. At those times I was eager to put those experiences behind me and forget about it however still fell into a sort of social anxiety/paranoia from 2015-2017 at which point I left New York City taking the freelancing rhythm of my life on the road. I was based out of Maryland that summer yet traveled to festivals all over the country for the job I had. Then I spent the next several months out in Virginia where I attended a great church with a female pastor and a congregation that consisted of about twenty women and two men. The community there was a big catalyst for me pulling myself back together.\n\nAfter that I applied for and accepted my first permanent job in a management position at a concert venue in Washington DC but in the eight months I was there received progressively unnerving approaches from one of the male staff members. That compounded with my desire to get back on the road touring prompted me to quit. On top of all that, working with the same large group of men day to day made me more paranoid than working with men in passing on my typical 1-3 month gigs. However I assumed that it might've just been a symptom of the overall environment of that workplace.\n\nCurrently I am on my longest tour yet: an 11 month contract that began in July 2019. By this point I noticed the overwhelming pattern that I am only able to feel relaxed around women. I'm responsible for all the logistics of the tour unit. I'm the one who dictates who rides in each car and who is where on each bus. For all of these I've made it so I'm only with women whether that be in a car or in a certain area of the bus. However my fellow managers are men and recently I was forced to change the car assignments due to a change in our overall production schedule. Because of this I share an office with them in each arena or theater we go to. The crew, as per usual, is also mostly men. While things were mostly fine from July-November, since December I've been developing a growing sense of anxiety around my coworkers for seemingly no good reason.

Hello humans, \n\nBelow is a non-graphic summary of my current predicament and I was hoping to gain some advice!\n\nI work in the live production world in general - concert/theatrical touring shows specifically - and I am 26 years old. This interest of mine began in high school when I had the opportunity to participate in our school's theater program for which I built sets, hung lights, and operated audio. This was also my first co-ed experience as from age 4 to 18 I went to an all girls school. To put on theater productions, however, we would work with the all boys school across the street. While I did well in theater back then, I was often ignored by the other students and teachers as they all came from the boys school and weren't sure how to interact with me... I think. Even when I became a vital participant in making productions happen, I kept to myself because I was also put off by the social dynamic of the boys.\n\nI pursued this in New York City where I went to college during which time being the only woman on a production crew was also the norm. In 2013 and 2015 respectively I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body. The earlier was while working at a music festival, the later was during an off campus Black Student Union event. At those times I was eager to put those experiences behind me and forget about it however still fell into a sort of social anxiety/paranoia from 2015-2017 at which point I left New York City taking the freelancing rhythm of my life on the road. I was based out of Maryland that summer yet traveled to festivals all over the country for the job I had. Then I spent the next several months out in Virginia where I attended a great church with a female pastor and a congregation that consisted of about twenty women and two men. The community there was a big catalyst for me pulling myself back together.\n\nAfter that I applied for and accepted my first permanent job in a management position at a concert venue in Washington DC but in the eight months I was there received progressively unnerving approaches from one of the male staff members. That compounded with my desire to get back on the road touring prompted me to quit. On top of all that, working with the same large group of men day to day made me more paranoid than working with men in passing on my typical 1-3 month gigs. However I assumed that it might've just been a symptom of the overall environment of that workplace.\n\nCurrently I am on my longest tour yet: an 11 month contract that began in July 2019. By this point I noticed the overwhelming pattern that I am only able to feel relaxed around women. I'm responsible for all the logistics of the tour unit. I'm the one who dictates who rides in each car and who is where on each bus. For all of these I've made it so I'm only with women whether that be in a car or in a certain area of the bus. However my fellow managers are men and recently I was forced to change the car assignments due to a change in our overall production schedule. Because of this I share an office with them in each arena or theater we go to. The crew, as per usual, is also mostly men. While things were mostly fine from July-November, since December I've been developing a growing sense of anxiety around my coworkers for seemingly no good reason. This culminated two weeks ago with me having a panic attack from sitting between two of them on a four hour plane ride during which they were asleep most of the time which resulted in lots of accidental physical contact and being breathed on.\n\nI've been averse to physical contact my whole life but since college it evolved into more of an acute fear.
