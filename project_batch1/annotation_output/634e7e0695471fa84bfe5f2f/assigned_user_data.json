The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.\n\n\n2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming \"OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP\" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.\n\n\nOver the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???\n\n\nTL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick \"fetish\". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."}, "2251_counseling": {"id": "2251_counseling", "text": "I'm a teenager.

I've suffered from PTSD since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 20 now) and diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18. For years, I would have nightmares where I would relive the experience, which seems pretty common. When I got to about 14, I would go about 2 or 3 days without sleeping to avoid these nightmares because I didn't know how to cope with them. When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.\n\nThe dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating. Everything was going as planned until about 20 minutes in. At this point, I was hearing a man speaking aggressively in French (much like Jacques Brel, but the voice sounded deeper). I'm not fluent in French, so whatever I was hearing is a mystery. The next day a similar thing happened after a nightmare except this time it sounded like a low-flying airplane was in my head. It was loud enough to scare me out of meditation and make my heart race. \n\nThe nightmares have been less frequent since then. I have, however, been experiencing more straightforward hallucinations. Every few hours or so, I'll see a humanoid figure in the corner of my eye. Like someone is behind me watching me. More recently I've also been seeing shadow-like figures running around right in front of me. The other night I was in my girlfriend's room watching a show with her when I noticed in the other corner of the room a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye. I couldn't focus on it enough to make out any features, but I did my best to make sure I really saw something. When I finally glanced over, it was gone. She knew something was up, as I seemed distracted (or maybe she sensed my terror) and asked me what was wrong. I just said I thought I saw something. \n\nI'm afraid to come forward about all of this to anyone in my everyday life. I'm afraid people may think there's something wrong with me. I just need someone to verify that this is normal with PTSD and not another mental illness. I'd also appreciate any anecdotes or advice. Thank you in advance. This has just been scary.
