My back story is thst in 2015 I fell during a free solo rock climb in the Ozark Mountains. I fell from approximately 50 ft and was kept alive by my two best friends until I was loaded into a helicopter five hours later. I lost seven teeth, crushed the right side of my face and broke my left humerus. While it's not ideal, I've accepted this moment in my life and the results of it. In a roundabout way, it's lead to one of my best friends meeting his now-fiancee and put me on a positive direction in life as opposed to bouncing around from job to job.\n\nOver the past couple of years I dealt with roughly one dream a week reliving the experience and waking up in a panic. For the past year I've been going to a rock climbing gym and the dreams have largely stopped. I still avoid ladders and other heights, but I'm comfortable on the rock wall. I'm not as daring as others there, and it really limits the difficulty of climbs I can complete because I don't put myself out there as much as I could to make the more difficult moves. Sometimes I fall, but it's generally expected. Or I jump off because I'm worn out. \n\nToday I had an unexpected fall. It was only from about 7ft, but my foot slipped, just like it did in my accident. I hit the ground awkwardly, but unhurt and didn't stop shaking for an hour. I was on the verge of tears as I left the gym and bought a pack of cigarettes (I've been on an ecig for a few months). To top it off, I had to go in for a work meeting where the manager tore into us for the general decline in standards that's occurred lately, which is a whole other story.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm still on edge, and I don't want to sleep because I know I'll have a dream where I fall, or I lose my teeth, or crush my face or something. I was doing so well, and I know it's just a bad day, but I'm terrified that this step back will have more of an impact.

Hmmm...Is it that you don't fight because you don't bring up what's bothering you? Are you avoiding conflict? Many people do. What do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away? As an engaged couple, now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance. Better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real.

This may get rockier before it gets better, but until you face what's not working, you won't know who you truly are as a couple. \u00a0When you're engaged, it's a really cool time to see a therapist too...to get some conflict resolution skills down before you're a married couple.", "displayed_text": "Hi Rockford, While no relationship is \"perfect\", and it's natural for the passionate beginnings of a relationship to lessen with time, because we have established the trust and love needed as a foundation and we don't have to smother each other with attention anymore, your situation sounds like something different.\u00a0\"He has no time for me\"... yet you don't fight.

Here are a few examples. 1. Never had a father figure in my life, I have been always missing that, finally got around to start a relationship with my dad (I'm 39yrs old), and turns out all he wanted was for me to buy him a car... so i told him to pack sand. Next, my 2 oldest children said they want nothing to do with me, and haven't talked to them in almost a year now, they don't take my calls or anything (I am not a druggy, alcoholic, never been arrested, hold a masters degree and a 120k a year job)... 3rd, my wife and i are getting a divorce at the moment after 10 yrs. I've been pretty much knocked down to the ground, so deep that i feel nothing. The only thing i have in this world is my passion for cars and even then i'm criticized left and right for having that passion. I think of \"quitting\" daily. I hide behind the occasional laughter.

I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends.

We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows.

I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? \n\nA few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them.

I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest.
