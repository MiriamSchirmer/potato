It's the morning. On my way back, a druggie said HEY BEAUTIFUL and eating me alive with his eyes. I didnt even acknowledge his presence. He stopped, and yelled back at me, you cant even say hi you white bitch. \n\nI'm walking to the subway and a group of younger city kids pass me, they start saying stuff to me and when they pass me, I still hear them. I say \"stfu\" as I pass them, fed up with the fucking day.

Everytime I walk out there are these druggies lingering right across from me. I'm paranoid they know where I live. \n\nI'm going for a run and walking through the block to get to the river. I hear a guy say hi and whistling from a car parked on the street, but I didnt see which one it was coming from. \n\nI was walking to the river another day and a homeless drugged up man started saying hi and walking towards me and when I didnt respond and walked away he screamed IM GONNA GET YOU til I was out of distance. \n\nI go on the subway.. WITH my boyfriend for the first time in a while. A bunch of city kids get on and start doing a very very loud, screaming, violent type performance. I was triggered and they were stomping back and forth down the train cart. It was so long til the next stop. They kept coming over to us and across from me was the only other white girl on the cart. He puts his fist out for her to pound it. She didnt at first but he didnt move, so she did. Then he comes over to me and puts his fuckin fist out. My bf put his hand in front of me and pounded him for me. He walked away. He did this to the only two white girls on the train, even when I was with my bf. \n\nI was on a train alone and a bunch of city kids got on and were hanging from the subway handles and started talking shit about white girls and dumb bitches. \n\nI was walking to my apartment and heard a guysaying, blondie, blondieee behind me. \n\nI was walking on the river and a city guy passed me and said PUT A SMILE ON. Then I gave him a death stare and he called me a bitch. \n\nI've been raped by one of these city, drug dealer type guys. I live in this city alone. In my hometown these types of bad people would stalk me and pick on me for some reason. I'm a walking target. I dont feel safe leaving my house to go to the corner store. I'm scared to go on the subway to go ANYWHERE now. I dont have money to uber everywhere. It's so hard cause this could be real danger. It's so triggering and idk what to do. There is no one I know in this city or state. My bf is 2.5 hours away and very busy working full time. I am no contact and estranged from all family members and friends.

Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.\n\nSo after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.\n\nAs I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.\n\n\nSo here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:\n\nSome years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.\n\nAll this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.\n\nThen after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.\n\nSome time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.\n\nBefore all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.\n\nNow after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. \n\nSo my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?\n", "displayed_text": "Could I have PTSD?

I clarified with her that attendance at the meeting would be my highest priority and asked for a full roster of needed ADA Accommodations. She agreed with most of my suggestions, we implemented a plan that's been working since. She was asked to follow up with HR on my request that all PTSD-related absences be excluded from the policy (she raised that I was \"getting into trouble\" with the policy and she would have to let me go if I violated it). I never heard back, so didn't worry about it (she has always been very lax with the attendance policy for all in the department).\n\nFlash to February 2018, I have my first high-symptom call-out day (8 hours) in a while (about 3 months). Boss reviews all my absences since my return, and asks for documentation on two from 2017. She says it is because I'm bumping against the company policy for too many absence occurrences in 12 months. She is only looking at PTSD-related events, as the two times I had the flu this year didn't spark any kind of review, nor did non-PTSD absences last year. I ask her about the policy exception we discussed in August, and suddenly she's on the defensive. She responds that there is no exception, and decides she told me about this last year. It didn't happen, so I ask for documentation. She can't find any.\n\nLast Monday, I had a meeting with HR to \"formally\" open my ADA accommodation request. Per the company, this is the first time I'm asking for anything, because my boss never brought my August conversation to HR, nor educated me that there was additional steps to formalize it. I meet with HR, I give them an updated list of accommodations, they give me paperwork for my doctor - no problem.\n\nWhen I look at the paperwork, the job description isn't mine - it is for a coworker in another department. I send a copy of what I have on file, and ask for confirmation it is correct. A WEEK LATER I am still arguing with my supervisor and HR as they keep insisting I hold a job that I do not (completely different scope than my actual job, as actually described in the JD I have from 2 yeas ago). My job description now needs to go through the full HR review process and be approved.\n\n**TL/DR and Ultimate question:** Are they trying to screw me? The culture at my employer is one of intolerance/purposeful ignorance of PTSD and its impacts. They do not take this seriously, and continue to set arbitrary \"blackout days\" that I \"cannot have a high symptom day on\" without risking my job. As you know - this is nearly impossible to agree to given the variability of trigger events. I think they're trying to let me go... am I being paranoid or could this be their shady way of saying I'm in a job that doesn't exist so am ultimately downsized and they avoid the ADA protections? \n\nHELP!", "displayed_text": "ADA Accommodations - Shadiness Hi All! \n\nI know this might not be the best place to post - but I'm wondering if any of you have had issues when requesting ADA accommodations for your PTSD?\n\nLong story short - I've been with my current employer 5 years; I am in an executive-level position and have had 5 years of great performance reviews; Late 2016 my PTSD ratcheted up after I was flooded with childhood sexual trauma memories; I took FMLA in January 2017 for the full 12 weeks, returned to work part time for two months, then full time since.\n\nIn August 2017, my manager decided I needed to meet with her to discuss accommodations for her made-up \"Essential Duties\" of being in-person at a single meeting per month.
