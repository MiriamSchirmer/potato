I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that \"traditional college experience.\" Truth is, I really hate it. I was diagnosed with PTSD at the end of 2018, alongside depression and anxiety. My trauma happened in February of 2018, so it is pretty fresh and still hurts. It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. \n\nMy other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the \"Traditional college experience\" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week. It might be a long shot that anyone has experience with this. Regardless, can anyone give me some help/advice/reassurance? I'm not sure what to do.

I clarified with her that attendance at the meeting would be my highest priority and asked for a full roster of needed ADA Accommodations. She agreed with most of my suggestions, we implemented a plan that's been working since. She was asked to follow up with HR on my request that all PTSD-related absences be excluded from the policy (she raised that I was \"getting into trouble\" with the policy and she would have to let me go if I violated it). I never heard back, so didn't worry about it (she has always been very lax with the attendance policy for all in the department).\n\nFlash to February 2018, I have my first high-symptom call-out day (8 hours) in a while (about 3 months). Boss reviews all my absences since my return, and asks for documentation on two from 2017. She says it is because I'm bumping against the company policy for too many absence occurrences in 12 months. She is only looking at PTSD-related events, as the two times I had the flu this year didn't spark any kind of review, nor did non-PTSD absences last year. I ask her about the policy exception we discussed in August, and suddenly she's on the defensive. She responds that there is no exception, and decides she told me about this last year. It didn't happen, so I ask for documentation. She can't find any.\n\nLast Monday, I had a meeting with HR to \"formally\" open my ADA accommodation request. Per the company, this is the first time I'm asking for anything, because my boss never brought my August conversation to HR, nor educated me that there was additional steps to formalize it. I meet with HR, I give them an updated list of accommodations, they give me paperwork for my doctor - no problem.\n\nWhen I look at the paperwork, the job description isn't mine - it is for a coworker in another department. I send a copy of what I have on file, and ask for confirmation it is correct. A WEEK LATER I am still arguing with my supervisor and HR as they keep insisting I hold a job that I do not (completely different scope than my actual job, as actually described in the JD I have from 2 yeas ago). My job description now needs to go through the full HR review process and be approved.\n\n**TL/DR and Ultimate question:** Are they trying to screw me? The culture at my employer is one of intolerance/purposeful ignorance of PTSD and its impacts. They do not take this seriously, and continue to set arbitrary \"blackout days\" that I \"cannot have a high symptom day on\" without risking my job. As you know - this is nearly impossible to agree to given the variability of trigger events. I think they're trying to let me go... am I being paranoid or could this be their shady way of saying I'm in a job that doesn't exist so am ultimately downsized and they avoid the ADA protections? \n\nHELP!", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 380, "end": 432, "span": " I was flooded with childhood sexual trauma memories", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 0s "}}
