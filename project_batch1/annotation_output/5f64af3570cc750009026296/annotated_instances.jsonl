{"id": "869_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Delayed reaction About 15 years ago I was a passenger in a car that my ex was driving. Our two young kids were passengers and he was driving too close to the car in front, and too fast. I saw it coming. The car in front brakes and my ex wasn\u2019t watching. Our car clipped the back of the car in front and rolled several times into the freeway. When the car stopped it was eerie. We were upside down and had been hit from behind. I was left in the car with our kids (3 and 9). My ex had crawled out and I turned round and was blindly feeling and calling for our kids. To cut a long story short it was an absolute miracle that any of us, never mind all of us survived.\n\nI have since been such a nervous passenger but have done almost all of the required hours to help our kids through learning to drive. I am only just realising the absolute trauma I have experienced.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great with it, but like always I just get on with things.

{"id": "1345_ptsd", "displayed_text": "How do I get passed it? So I recently had oral cancer. (History:physically and mentally abusive childhood, abandonment, bullied, depression, self harm). After my surgery, a hole appeared in the floor of my mouth. A surgeon came into my 6 bed bay at 2am and using local anaesthetic stitched up the floor of my mouth by a flashlight that her assistant was holding, she stabbed me through the lip (which wasn't numbed) a couple of times and the next day I found out she hadn't done it properly and still had a hole. The surgeon  wanted me to go under General and get it sorted but I was too scared and so let it heal naturally which took 3 weeks on NG tube which made me sick. I have bad veins also and was stabbed numerous times every day by people trying to find veins for canulars or to take bloods. 2 doctors gave me a nose bleed because they were trying to very forcefully shove a large NG tube that was the wrong size up my nose. My dietician  restricted my water and I had severe dehydration headaches all weekend while she was off and no one would up my water intake because her word is law or whatever. Anyway long story short, it was a lash up and lots of horrible things happened to me along with just trying to deal with getting cancer and going through treatment. So since then I have nightmares every night, I can't sleep, I grind my teeth all day getting angry at how (I've tried) but can't get any help for what happened to me and psychological help. So it didn't really click until I went for an eye test and they did the glaucoma air pressure test and I completely broke down. I was so embarrassed because the lady doing it clearly didn't get it, it's only a burst of air to the eye, it doesn't hurt. Which I get. But to me, it was another test, another thing being done to me in a kind of medical setting and I just couldn't handle it and lost my shit.
