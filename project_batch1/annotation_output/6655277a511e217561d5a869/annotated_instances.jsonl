I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. \n\n*My dad did drugs\n*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once\n*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once\n*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)\n*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.\n*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)\n*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we \"misbehaved\" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.\n*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. \n*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. \n*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. \n*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.\n*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.\n*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. \n*I was in a \"relationship\" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).\n*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. \n\nAll of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.\n\nI want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old.

My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house.

Then for some reason, it started to become rocky and this is when my episodes really ramped up. I did not truly understand that I was having flashbacks until after it was all over but essentially this SO told me that \"whatever I was doing\" to address my PTSD wasn't working and that I had \"lost the ability\" to control my emotions and I was not as resilient as I used to be. I would get so mad and upset and irrational and he would too. After my worst flashback he did not speak to me for 2 weeks - because he needed space. (I don't blame him, but it was excruciating and I felt so much shame because I was reeling from the trigger) After the 2 weeks he broke up with me.\n\nThis all cut me to my core.

Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. \n\nHey Everyone,   \nFirst time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   \n\n\n1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. \n2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. \n3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him \"If you're gonna hit me, do it!\" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said \"Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her\". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me \"oh I fight with my brothers too!\" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. \n4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. \n5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that \"if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault\".   \n\n\nIn my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole \"PTSD\" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   \nIdk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this.

{"id": "1688_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Morning Panic Hey everyone, \n\nTo give you some background, I use to work in a locked mental health facility for children and it wasn't the best run facility. I worked there a year and a half and I had my hair pulled, been spit on, punched, kicked, slapped, insulted, ect. There were periods of time where I would get hurt everyday at work for weeks. Not to mention hearing/seeing all the stories of what the kids went through and having to do \"therapeutic holds\" on children that are going through a mental health crisis.  I ended up leaving that job shortly after I got divorced and I have a great new job that is way lower stress/anxiety/trauma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell now here I am about a year later and every morning when I wake up I panic about having to go to work. I get so worked up I generally throw up every morning while getting ready for work and sometimes I have to pull over to throw up again. I have talked about this to my old therapist and I am finding a new therapist (just changed over insurance due getting a new job). I don't know what to do about this. The thing that has helped most is deep breathing exercises, but it usually takes me calming down on the hour drive to work to just get to a point where I can function. Any suggestions?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 197, "end": 272, "span": "I had my hair pulled, been spit on, punched, kicked, slapped, insulted, ect", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 23s "}}
