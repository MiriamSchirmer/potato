When I was in middle school my older brother got into drugs and became a heroin addict shortly after. My mother would cry everyday and act coldly toward me and my little brother. She would go on fits of panic hyperventilating and pacing through our whole house and saying stuff like \u201cplease god just take my life instead of his\u201d. My dad would scream at my older brother horrible things and I don\u2019t blame him because my brother was horrible. He would steal things like my favorite video games and pawn them for drug money and I was too scared of upsetting my parents so I wouldn\u2019t tell them. I loved my brother so much I wanted to protect him even though he was ruining my life. I would find his burnt spoons and pills and just sob all night. I watched him but drugs from weird cars in front of our house when I\u2019d get home from school. Sometimes the drug cars would sit outside my house when I was home alone and I was so scared and confused. I would walk past his room and he would be sitting still with a blank expression staring at one corner of his room like a zombie. He actually overdosed and was dead until he was resuscitated in the ER. My parents would pay for different rehabs and they never worked. My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house.

Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. \n\nHey Everyone,   \nFirst time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   \n\n\n1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. \n2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. \n3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him \"If you're gonna hit me, do it!\" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said \"Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her\". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me \"oh I fight with my brothers too!\" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. \n4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. \n5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that \"if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault\".   \n\n\nIn my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole \"PTSD\" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   \nIdk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this.

I opened the can of worms recently (a few years ago), and started dealing with my trauma. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 16.  Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. \n\n*My dad did drugs\n*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once\n*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once\n*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)\n*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.\n*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)\n*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we \"misbehaved\" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.\n*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. \n*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. \n*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. \n*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.\n*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.\n*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. \n*I was in a \"relationship\" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).\n*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. \n\nAll of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough.

I opened the can of worms recently (a few years ago), and started dealing with my trauma. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 16.  Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. \n\n*My dad did drugs\n*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once\n*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once\n*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)\n*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.\n*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)\n*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we \"misbehaved\" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.\n*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. \n*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. \n*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. \n*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.\n*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.\n*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. \n*I was in a \"relationship\" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).\n*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. \n\nAll of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.\n\nI want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end.

I clarified with her that attendance at the meeting would be my highest priority and asked for a full roster of needed ADA Accommodations. She agreed with most of my suggestions, we implemented a plan that's been working since. She was asked to follow up with HR on my request that all PTSD-related absences be excluded from the policy (she raised that I was \"getting into trouble\" with the policy and she would have to let me go if I violated it). I never heard back, so didn't worry about it (she has always been very lax with the attendance policy for all in the department).\n\nFlash to February 2018, I have my first high-symptom call-out day (8 hours) in a while (about 3 months). Boss reviews all my absences since my return, and asks for documentation on two from 2017. She says it is because I'm bumping against the company policy for too many absence occurrences in 12 months. She is only looking at PTSD-related events, as the two times I had the flu this year didn't spark any kind of review, nor did non-PTSD absences last year. I ask her about the policy exception we discussed in August, and suddenly she's on the defensive. She responds that there is no exception, and decides she told me about this last year. It didn't happen, so I ask for documentation. She can't find any.\n\nLast Monday, I had a meeting with HR to \"formally\" open my ADA accommodation request. Per the company, this is the first time I'm asking for anything, because my boss never brought my August conversation to HR, nor educated me that there was additional steps to formalize it. I meet with HR, I give them an updated list of accommodations, they give me paperwork for my doctor - no problem.\n\nWhen I look at the paperwork, the job description isn't mine - it is for a coworker in another department. I send a copy of what I have on file, and ask for confirmation it is correct. A WEEK LATER I am still arguing with my supervisor and HR as they keep insisting I hold a job that I do not (completely different scope than my actual job, as actually described in the JD I have from 2 yeas ago). My job description now needs to go through the full HR review process and be approved.\n\n**TL/DR and Ultimate question:** Are they trying to screw me? The culture at my employer is one of intolerance/purposeful ignorance of PTSD and its impacts.

I clarified with her that attendance at the meeting would be my highest priority and asked for a full roster of needed ADA Accommodations. She agreed with most of my suggestions, we implemented a plan that's been working since. She was asked to follow up with HR on my request that all PTSD-related absences be excluded from the policy (she raised that I was \"getting into trouble\" with the policy and she would have to let me go if I violated it). I never heard back, so didn't worry about it (she has always been very lax with the attendance policy for all in the department).\n\nFlash to February 2018, I have my first high-symptom call-out day (8 hours) in a while (about 3 months). Boss reviews all my absences since my return, and asks for documentation on two from 2017. She says it is because I'm bumping against the company policy for too many absence occurrences in 12 months. She is only looking at PTSD-related events, as the two times I had the flu this year didn't spark any kind of review, nor did non-PTSD absences last year. I ask her about the policy exception we discussed in August, and suddenly she's on the defensive. She responds that there is no exception, and decides she told me about this last year. It didn't happen, so I ask for documentation. She can't find any.\n\nLast Monday, I had a meeting with HR to \"formally\" open my ADA accommodation request. Per the company, this is the first time I'm asking for anything, because my boss never brought my August conversation to HR, nor educated me that there was additional steps to formalize it. I meet with HR, I give them an updated list of accommodations, they give me paperwork for my doctor - no problem.\n\nWhen I look at the paperwork, the job description isn't mine - it is for a coworker in another department. I send a copy of what I have on file, and ask for confirmation it is correct. A WEEK LATER I am still arguing with my supervisor and HR as they keep insisting I hold a job that I do not (completely different scope than my actual job, as actually described in the JD I have from 2 yeas ago). My job description now needs to go through the full HR review process and be approved.\n\n**TL/DR and Ultimate question:** Are they trying to screw me? The culture at my employer is one of intolerance/purposeful ignorance of PTSD and its impacts. They do not take this seriously, and continue to set arbitrary \"blackout days\" that I \"cannot have a high symptom day on\" without risking my job. As you know - this is nearly impossible to agree to given the variability of trigger events. I think they're trying to let me go... am I being paranoid or could this be their shady way of saying I'm in a job that doesn't exist so am ultimately downsized and they avoid the ADA protections? \n\nHELP!"}, "2123_ptsd": {"id": "2123_ptsd", "text": "Curious Question: Was anyone else genuinely frustrated when they were diagnosed?

Haven't posted in r/ptsd, but this came up. \n\n# Family Makeup\n\n(If you want to get to the question at hand without my life story, just skip to the heading \"The Dilemma\")\n\nI am from a large family. Middle child of 7.\n\nI never really knew my father (for the best, really. I have zero desire to know him), because he was sent to prison (rightfully so) when I was very young. Before I can remember, honestly. But my brother and I were his sons. My parents had 3 other children before us, my 3 older half-siblings (I rarely call them half-siblings, only for clarity sake when detailing family histories). This story really doesn't include my older half-siblings for the most part, only briefly. They are 10, 9, and 4 years older than me.\n\nWhen I was 2 or 3, my mother met and married a new man, we will call him Harry (his name was not Harry). And they had a daughter together, my younger half-sister. So, my younger brother, younger sister, and I were all born within 3.5 years of each other, my younger half-sister being 3.5 years younger than me.  My father also had another daughter when I was 13. So, my siblings and I range in birth years from 1975 to 2003.\n\nBut really, this story focuses on me, my younger full-brother (11 months younger than me), my younger half-sister (3.5 years younger than me), my mother, and my step-father.\n\n# The Wretched Brothers (TW: Physical and Verbal/Emotional Abuse)\n\nSo, my step-father would abuse my brother and me, a lot. Every night. He was an alcoholic, and would often beat my brother and me, along with more severe physical abuse (&gt;!burning us with cigarettes and coffee irons, pushing us down the stairs, locking us in the basement, forcing us to sleep on tiles floors underneath a pool table.... so much. We would have bruises and burns that we had to hide from school officials. !&lt;). Not only did he physically abuse my brother and me, he also abused our mother in similar ways. The infraction could be as mundane as ... well nothing. Sometimes, I am convinced he just did these things because he enjoyed to see us suffer. Honestly. Because we would do absolutely nothing, but get punished for it. Spilled milk? Punished. Breathed too loudly? Punished. Sat in the corner minding our own business? Punished. And by \"punished,\" I mean the abuse that I have hidden under spoiler tags.\n\nBut, though the physical abuse was intense, the emotional/verbal abuse was much, much worse. A bruise can heal, but the things he said to us affected our whole lives. This was much more than just being overly critical or saying hurtful things now-and-then. This was constant. He would call us the worse things imaginable. He refused to let us go anywhere because he said that we were thieves (we weren't). Every night, he would angrily tell us how worthless we were, calling us the most vile names. We were locked in the basement when company was over because we would \"embarrass him.\"\n\nNow, looking back to when I was a kid, from what I remember, we were pretty much like every other child (I had some bizarre idiosyncrasies, but my brother was completely normal, honestly). And asking people who knew us from that time, we were regarded as pretty delightful children, who weren't prone to mischief more so than any other child. Actually, we were described as timid and respectful.\n\nBasically, the abuse did not match our behavior. And even if we were the terrifically unruly children that he said we were, we didn't deserve *that.*\n\nAlongside the physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, there was also neglect. We didn't have beds, and were forced to sleep on the tile floor under the pool table. We rarely got the clothes we needed, having to wear clothes that we obviously had outgrew. And, for a time, we were homeless and couldn't get food. Much of this was due to abject poverty, but even when we weren't in dire straits, we were still not afforded the necessities. This also falls somewhat on my mother, but that is unfair to blame her for any of this, which I will expound upon later.\n\n# The Golden Child\n\nI suspect you saw this coming. My brother and I were abused and neglected, and my younger half-sister could do no wrong. Now, of course, she was his daughter. And in many ways, she was raised as if she was an only child. While my brother, my mother, and I were relegated to the basement floor, my half-sister lived a life of privilege upstairs. She got all the newest clothes. She had her own room with a bed. She got anything she ever wanted. And, growing up in a household like this, I assumed this is just how life was. Boys were treated like trash, and girls were treated like royalty. It made sense at the time, I suppose (mind you, I was under 12).\n\nI cannot tell you how many times my brother and I would be punished for something my sister did. We would *watch* our sister do something terrible, then blame it on us, and we would get punished. Then our mother/step-father would praise her for being brave enough to tell! It was infuriating!!! No matter how much my brother and I protested and told the truth, no one believed us. My sister laughs about this to this day.\n\nNow, looking back she too was being abused, just in a different way. The favorite(s) is(are) being abused just as much as the scapegoat(s). It is just a different dynamic.\n\nTo illustrate how different our lives were, my older half-sister on my father's side would call to talk to my brother and me. We weren't allowed to talk to her, but my younger half-sister would have full conversation with her. I didn't find this out until I was an adult, and my older half-sister told me. No one told us that my older half-sister called us ever. But, every time she called, she got to speak with my younger half-sister. Mind you, they are not related in any way (I suppose they share two half-brothers).\n\n# The Nightmare Ends\n\nFrom the time I was 3, until the time I was 12, this was my life (with a small respite when my mother finally got fed up with it all and left him for a few months). Nothing I did was good enough (a trait that has followed me throughout life). Daily being abused. Watching our sister live an entirely different life. And having nothing to compare it to, because to us, this was how things *are.* We didn't know it wasn't normal to be treated like this. It wasn't until maybe high school that I realized, \"Wow, people didn't live like this!\" But, it finally ended one day in October when I was 12.\n\nHarry died unexpectedly. I shed not a single tear. I was sad for my sister. I was somewhat sad for my mother. I was sad for Harry's parents. But, in almost all ways, I was relieved and happy he was dead. So was my brother. And I suspect, my mother was at least relieved he would no longer torture any of us.\n\nMy sister was 8 years old at the time.\n\n# My Dear Mother\n\nI love my mother. I feel like she did the best with what she had. She loved each of us intensely. She had an infectious laugh, and a caring spirit. She was a joy to be around. Most of the time.\n\nCounterintuitively, my most horrific memories have to do with my mother. You see, she was schizophrenic, and because of that, every single one of us children went through some awful experiences.\n\nNow, when she was not experiencing a psychotic episode, she was the loving, amazing woman we all adored. But during those true psychotic episodes (of which she had no control over, having breakthrough episodes even on her medication), I and my siblings experienced some of the most traumatic experiences of our lives. Later in life, while I was an adult, so more prepared to cope with the trauma, my mother once blew up her oxygen tank, setting fire to her assisted living facility. Throughout the years, she had numerous episodes.\n\nThis is why I rarely blame my mother for not doing enough to protect us and herself. She was scared herself. Harry, on more than one occasion, &gt;!threatened to kill her and my brother and me. My mother would tell us that she would often wake up with Harry strangling her in the middle of the night. Plus, he was a hunter, and kept her gunpoint - metaphorically.!&lt; Add this with her underlying mental illness, and it is very difficult to assign any blame to my mother. She couldn't work, and at the time, she couldn't get on disability either. The one time she did find the courage to leave Harry, we ended up starving, freezing, and homeless. And then Harry came to stay with us while homeless, before eventually moving us to his car, then his parent's motorhome, and then finally.. the basement.\n\nSince my mother was in a vulnerable position (her mental health and having no income due to disability), it just seems like predatory men found her, and made her life (and her children's lives) miserable.\n\nIn my head, yes, the experiences were traumatic, but in the same way a hurricane or earthquake is traumatic. Who do you blame?\n\n# The Aftermath\n\nSo, now it is well over 20 years since Harry died. My mother passed in 2013 due to lung cancer/COPD. I have spent years in therapy, trying to heal. Even tried to be a therapist myself (big mistake. Trigger. Trigger. Trigger. HOSPITAL!). I have lived with daily SI since probably the time I was 9, and have had nearly 20 psych hospitalizations throughout the last 20 years. I am living knowing that I survived quite an ordeal.\n\nBut, my brother did not survive Harry's abuse. He died by suicide when he was 17. Clearly, Harry wasn't the only trauma that we had experienced. Often times when my mother would have a psychotic episode, my brother and I would be shuffled in and out of foster care. Sometimes together, sometimes apart. One time we were put in juvenile detention because we were \"too old for foster care.\" We were 13 and 14. We had different privileges than everyone else because we weren't there for \"delinquency,\" which actually made us more of targets (we got treated differently by staff, so the other boys would beat us, and one &gt;!sexually assaulted us.!&lt;\n\nI got emancipated when I was 16. Had my own apartment. Went into the Army. Became an Army nurse. And here's the thing - basic training was *fun.* It was a breeze compared to what I had experienced earlier in life. Got out of the Army, went to college. Made a life as best as I could.\n\nBut even now, one thing still bugs me.\n\n# The Dilemma\n\nSo, now whenever I bring up Harry around my half-sister, she gets angry. She has said that I am exaggerating what happened, and that it wasn't that bad. I love my sister, and we are actually very close, but this is a real kicker.\n\nShe doesn't even acknowledge that her father did anything wrong. Which makes me question my own experiences. But it isn't like I am the only one saying these terrible things about her father. My mother confirmed what happened. My older siblings confirmed what happened. Even one of my half-sister's *cousins* confirmed what happened.\n\nWhich was oddly satisfying when I learned that her cousin confirmed the abuse. I was very active in church, and so during testimony, I would sometimes detail some of the experiences I had with Harry. I had a church mentor/friend who thought I was exaggerating, because to her, it sounded so outrageous, it must not have happened.\n\nWell, I started working for this church mentor/friend, and a few years later, we bring in a new employee. Without my permission, my boss/mentor/friend starts divulging my personal history to this new employee (yes, I realize how inappropriate this is). During the conversation the new employee thought it was weird how similar it was to the story of her aunt's and uncle's family house. Turns out, my half-sister is the employee's cousin once removed (my step-father is her cousin). She then goes on to inform my boss/mentor/friend how terrible the situation actually was, and that I might even have been minimizing what happened, definitely not exaggerating. This was a cousin who I was not even allowed to see because it would \"embarrass\" my step-father. Any time she would come to visit, we were locked in the basement.\n\nHow can my half-sister not acknowledge this? At least say something like \"I know my father was a complicated man, I still love him, but I abhor what he did to my two brothers.\" Or... anything? To her, \"Harry did nothing wrong, and the things he did do, y'all deserved it. And actually, it was our *mom* who messed us all up, not my dad.\"\n\nIt is hurtful and infuriating. To the point that we cannot talk about her dad at all.\n\nAnyone else experience this kind of gaslighting?", "displayed_text": "Do your siblings deride you for bringing up the abuse you experienced?

And having nothing to compare it to, because to us, this was how things *are.* We didn't know it wasn't normal to be treated like this. It wasn't until maybe high school that I realized, \"Wow, people didn't live like this!\" But, it finally ended one day in October when I was 12.\n\nHarry died unexpectedly. I shed not a single tear. I was sad for my sister. I was somewhat sad for my mother. I was sad for Harry's parents. But, in almost all ways, I was relieved and happy he was dead. So was my brother. And I suspect, my mother was at least relieved he would no longer torture any of us.\n\nMy sister was 8 years old at the time.\n\n# My Dear Mother\n\nI love my mother. I feel like she did the best with what she had. She loved each of us intensely. She had an infectious laugh, and a caring spirit. She was a joy to be around. Most of the time.\n\nCounterintuitively, my most horrific memories have to do with my mother. You see, she was schizophrenic, and because of that, every single one of us children went through some awful experiences.\n\nNow, when she was not experiencing a psychotic episode, she was the loving, amazing woman we all adored. But during those true psychotic episodes (of which she had no control over, having breakthrough episodes even on her medication), I and my siblings experienced some of the most traumatic experiences of our lives. Later in life, while I was an adult, so more prepared to cope with the trauma, my mother once blew up her oxygen tank, setting fire to her assisted living facility. Throughout the years, she had numerous episodes.\n\nThis is why I rarely blame my mother for not doing enough to protect us and herself. She was scared herself. Harry, on more than one occasion, &gt;!threatened to kill her and my brother and me. My mother would tell us that she would often wake up with Harry strangling her in the middle of the night. Plus, he was a hunter, and kept her gunpoint - metaphorically.!&lt; Add this with her underlying mental illness, and it is very difficult to assign any blame to my mother. She couldn't work, and at the time, she couldn't get on disability either. The one time she did find the courage to leave Harry, we ended up starving, freezing, and homeless. And then Harry came to stay with us while homeless, before eventually moving us to his car, then his parent's motorhome, and then finally.. the basement.\n\nSince my mother was in a vulnerable position (her mental health and having no income due to disability), it just seems like predatory men found her, and made her life (and her children's lives) miserable.\n\nIn my head, yes, the experiences were traumatic, but in the same way a hurricane or earthquake is traumatic. Who do you blame?\n\n# The Aftermath\n\nSo, now it is well over 20 years since Harry died. My mother passed in 2013 due to lung cancer/COPD. I have spent years in therapy, trying to heal. Even tried to be a therapist myself (big mistake. Trigger. Trigger. Trigger. HOSPITAL!). I have lived with daily SI since probably the time I was 9, and have had nearly 20 psych hospitalizations throughout the last 20 years. I am living knowing that I survived quite an ordeal.\n\nBut, my brother did not survive Harry's abuse. He died by suicide when he was 17. Clearly, Harry wasn't the only trauma that we had experienced. Often times when my mother would have a psychotic episode, my brother and I would be shuffled in and out of foster care. Sometimes together, sometimes apart. One time we were put in juvenile detention because we were \"too old for foster care.\" We were 13 and 14. We had different privileges than everyone else because we weren't there for \"delinquency,\" which actually made us more of targets (we got treated differently by staff, so the other boys would beat us, and one &gt;!sexually assaulted us.!&lt;\n\nI got emancipated when I was 16. Had my own apartment. Went into the Army. Became an Army nurse. And here's the thing - basic training was *fun.* It was a breeze compared to what I had experienced earlier in life. Got out of the Army, went to college. Made a life as best as I could.\n\nBut even now, one thing still bugs me.\n\n# The Dilemma\n\nSo, now whenever I bring up Harry around my half-sister, she gets angry. She has said that I am exaggerating what happened, and that it wasn't that bad. I love my sister, and we are actually very close, but this is a real kicker.\n\nShe doesn't even acknowledge that her father did anything wrong. Which makes me question my own experiences. But it isn't like I am the only one saying these terrible things about her father. My mother confirmed what happened. My older siblings confirmed what happened. Even one of my half-sister's *cousins* confirmed what happened.\n\nWhich was oddly satisfying when I learned that her cousin confirmed the abuse. I was very active in church, and so during testimony, I would sometimes detail some of the experiences I had with Harry. I had a church mentor/friend who thought I was exaggerating, because to her, it sounded so outrageous, it must not have happened.\n\nWell, I started working for this church mentor/friend, and a few years later, we bring in a new employee. Without my permission, my boss/mentor/friend starts divulging my personal history to this new employee (yes, I realize how inappropriate this is). During the conversation the new employee thought it was weird how similar it was to the story of her aunt's and uncle's family house. Turns out, my half-sister is the employee's cousin once removed (my step-father is her cousin). She then goes on to inform my boss/mentor/friend how terrible the situation actually was, and that I might even have been minimizing what happened, definitely not exaggerating. This was a cousin who I was not even allowed to see because it would \"embarrass\" my step-father. Any time she would come to visit, we were locked in the basement.\n\nHow can my half-sister not acknowledge this? At least say something like \"I know my father was a complicated man, I still love him, but I abhor what he did to my two brothers.\" Or... anything? To her, \"Harry did nothing wrong, and the things he did do, y'all deserved it. And actually, it was our *mom* who messed us all up, not my dad.\"\n\nIt is hurtful and infuriating. To the point that we cannot talk about her dad at all.\n\nAnyone else experience this kind of gaslighting?"}, "2556_counseling": {"id": "2556_counseling", "text": "Yes, it is normal to experience many different emotions in therapy because you are dealing with issues and situations that matter to you.

What makes people think it's ok to turn an actual mental illness into a joke to attack people they disagree with?? Has anyone else seen this stupid picture before?
