To the point that every year I dread my birthday. Today I\u2019m 19\n\nSchool has been over for some weeks so I\u2019m spending today as I have every day sitting around the house doing absolutely nothing except crying a little more and being more depressed. And that makes me sad. The day is over soon and I can\u2019t enjoy it\n\nMy parents tell me all year I\u2019m a bad kid and don\u2019t deserve anything and they buy things for me then use them against me to guilt trip me. Whenever they\u2019ve bought me huge gifts on my birthday I\u2019ve had a panic attack and then they get angry with me for not wanting to accept them. \n\nI get depressed and feel guilt when people express excitement. I get depressed and guilty when people buy me gifts, or praise or compliment me, or ask what I want so I tell them I want nothing. \n\nBut I do want to enjoy it. I just can\u2019t make myself. I do want gifts and to feel appreciated but the guilt overwhelms me. I get so upset when people compliment me or do anything. So it\u2019s just better if I\u2019m alone.

He still lives with us because he has high functioning autism and can only really work at a grocery (as he is now). My parents don\u2019t want him to work too much or he will no longer get disability and they\u2019re scared he\u2019ll have a fit at work and get fired even though he\u2019s been working there for like 2 years and been fine.\nWe don\u2019t have enough money to get him an apartment. My parents don\u2019t think he could survive on his own, so I\u2019m stuck living with him. \nSince I told he doesn\u2019t talk to me or look at me. I do the same towards him. This was until maybe 3 months ago when he had an outburst and screamed at me saying I\u2019m a \u201cjunkie lair who should finish what she started and kill yourself\u201d (I used to smoke weed and have attempted suicide before). \nHe\u2019s had an outburst like this three times now where he yells at me while I lock myself in another room. Talked to my dad about it and he said unless he sexually touches me or punches me hard (not light shoving) they aren\u2019t going to kick him out.\nA week ago I was sleeping on the couch because it\u2019s right by my parents room and makes me feel more sleep. He then went into the living room in the middle of the night and slept in the middle of the floor.\nHe\u2019s being creepy. He yells at me like once every week and half calling me a lair etc. Being in a house with him without going to school or to friends makes me feel terrible.\nI would stay at a friends but my mom has severe COPD so I can\u2019t because of the virus.\nI don\u2019t think I can do anything. I\u2019m only allowed to leave the house for a 2 hour walk every other day. I\u2019m unable to function well enough to get my schoolwork done. I feel terrible.

{"id": "1303_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I am too scared to live my life how I want to. I know that the title seems dramatic, but please look at it in a literal sense. \n\n\\-Backstory Time\n\nMy mother was married four times, and her third husband, was addicted to pills. I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. \n\nMy mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. \n\nI know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.\n\nMy mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-It's all downhill from here folks.\n\nSo how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Almost up to speed\n\nI have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. \n\nIt was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for reading guys, I feel a little better, feel free to inbox me or comment!", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 308, "end": 351, "span": " I just remembered being afraid of this man", "annotation": "uncertain"}, {"start": 376, "end": 416, "span": "when the abuse started to get really bad", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 939, "end": 984, "span": "claims that she didn't know what was going on", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1073, "span": "I was beaten", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1199, "span": "get my ass handed to me", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1780, "end": 1817, "span": "I turned 8 or 9, things got physical.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1952, "span": " drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 2087, "span": "throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2279, "span": "SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2488, "end": 2679, "span": "screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian", "annotation": "uncertain"}, {"start": 2995, "end": 3086, "span": "he KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis.

So background, in 2012 I witnessed my stepfather kill himself.\n\nThere on after I\u2019ve been battling my own thoughts and reoccurring episodes with many negative events in between then and now.\n\nI\u2019ve made many life changes, the most influential including 1 year of seeing a psychologist after being on medications, meeting my boyfriend who keeps me accountable on my actions, and maintaining a healthier life style.\n\nSo there\u2019s a few things that keep me from going into a panic attack and recognizing that is key.\n\nHowever, all my methods of coping today are not working after this dream I had. \nWriting is one of my methods, and I wrote this and I would really appreciate feedback or any insight on why I am not being able to withhold myself today.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing this, because I am experiencing and attempting to avoid a full blown panic attack. I am stronger then my negative thoughts, and I do have the power to control them. Writing about it makes it seem less real, and it isn\u2019t. My dream keeps playing in my head like a record and each time i get a glimpse of the record I avoid it. I avoid it as much as I can, because I am at work and I am capable of working a full time job without letting this effect me. So let\u2019s talk about it, I dreamt that any type of thing that supported my idea of killing my self was personified. The first person was Brian, he was in the dream with the bullet hole in his brain with the gun in his left hand telling me \u201cI did it, and you saw me do it. Why would you not want to get it over with? You are going to do it.\u201d Then the sound of him shooting himself replayed in my head echoing. The 2nd person, wasn\u2019t anyone I knew. It was a kid I saw hang himself on morbid reality, after the suicide I developed an almost sexual obsession with observing death. This was the first time I saw it happen on the internet, the same feeling echoed through my brain. The kid told me that it was my turn to be watched by the public. Then the video replayed in my dream with the sound of him struggling for air and finally passing. The third one was my ex husband, who was probably the worst. In the dream, he kept telling me to do it as he cut himself deeper and deeper in his arm. Then he said I\u2019m gonna do it, all because of you too. You deserve to die, then at the end of the dream he kept holding me down to put a knife against my throat and said this is how it ends, just do it yourself.\u201d\n\nI am also looking into talking to someone I can somewhat relate to on this, talking to your friends about this typically doesn\u2019t help me.\n\nThank you for listening.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 87, "end": 134, "span": "in 2012 I witnessed my stepfather kill himself.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 163, "end": 263, "span": "battling my own thoughts and reoccurring episodes with many negative events in between then and now.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 893, "end": 924, "span": "avoid a full blown panic attack", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1111, "span": "My dream keeps playing in my head like a record", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1563, "span": " dream with the bullet hole in his brain with the gun in his left hand telling me \u201cI did it, and you saw me do it", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1701, "span": "shooting himself replayed in my head echoing.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1868, "span": "t was a kid I saw hang himself on morbid reality, after the suicide I developed an almost sexual obsession with observing death", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2035, "end": 2130, "span": "hen the video replayed in my dream with the sound of him struggling for air and finally passing", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2207, "end": 2337, "span": "he kept telling me to do it as he cut himself deeper and deeper in his arm.

It makes me feel suffocated, I have panic attacks or at the least various elements of a panic attack. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe.
