{"id": "1740_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Am I overreacting? I was diagnosed with PTSD after leaving an abusive marriage. I feel pretty good most of the time, but still have triggers. I feel like my relationship with my boyfriend is strained at times because of my triggers/responses even though I\u2019ve tried to explain it to him. \n\nFor example, he sometimes reaches out and touches me while he\u2019s talking (like when he\u2019s making a point). Last week, I shrunk back from his touch and he looked at me like I was the Antichrist. I told him that I don\u2019t like to be poked or touched unexpectedly, but he still didn\u2019t seem to understand. This has nothing to do with him and it\u2019s a reflexive response for me. \n\nOne major trigger for me is violence, screaming etc. in movies...especially in the evening or near bed time because I have nightmares. I\u2019ve left the room before and gone to watch TV in the bedroom when he and my daughter were watching a scary movie and there was no issue. I\u2019ve told him many times that movies can be triggering for me. Last night, a movie came on where a woman was getting ready for a bed and a man in a mask was lurking outside. The music got ominous and I knew I had to get out of there FAST. I quickly went to the other room and turned the TV on to drown it out. I could feel my heart racing and my breath quickening just imagining what was happening on that TV in the other room. If he wanted to watch that movie, I was ok with it, I just couldn\u2019t be in that room. He came in and told me we needed to have a conversation about communication and how those situations could be better handled in the future. I told him that I left the room quickly because I knew something was coming and didn\u2019t want to see/hear it since it was close to bed time. I said it had nothing to do with him and I wasn\u2019t angry or anything. He continued to try to have a conversation about communication with me in that moment. I resented it. I feel like I did what I needed to in that moment to feel safe, and because it made him slightly uncomfortable, he was forcing me into a conversation I didn\u2019t want to have. He implied that I wasn\u2019t an adult.\n\nI have been suicidal at a number of points in my life, am an alcoholic and have done a lot of shitty things over the years to deal with my trauma. I\u2019m now almost 4 months sober and am really trying to be better. Leaving the room felt like the right thing to do in the moment and was a lot better strategy than things I have done in the past.

So I live with my mom (no job because of an eating disorder and flashbacks, but am getting help for the flashbacks soon and already for the ed) and sometimes when I take a nap, she knocks on the door and opens it and it scares the hell out of me. I'll scream at her and swear. It's like I can't control it. I'm always on guard. \n\nAny tips? I've told my mom about my assault and I said please not to barge in my room like that because my mind thinks she is my attacker and she really invalidated me like \"oh come on, I'm not your attacker, you are safe here!\" :/ so if she won't stop, I need tips on how to stop being a bitch...", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 434, "end": 444, "span": "my assault", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 505, "end": 539, "span": "my mind thinks she is my attacker ", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}
{"id": "2529_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD, or am I just over reacting? This might be triggering.\n\nThis is my first time posting here. I never really considered the possibility that I might have PTSD until very recently. I'm currently 31...when I was 19, I entered into my first real relationship. It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much. The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.\n\nAfter, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be \"getting him excited\" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong... Basically, it was my fault. I lived with guilt, shame, and just overall disgust for a really long time. \n\nEver since then, I have not been the same person. I lost trust in people....I can't enjoy sex....I'm afraid to date and fall in love....I'm afraid of men touching me.... I just avoid relationships and love all together. \n\nAnd that was just the first relationship. I don't even want to get into the second relationship, but he sexually violated me too. He purposely tampered with a condom to get me pregnant to keep me from transferring away to college. He thought that I'd decide to keep his baby and stay local with him. I aborted it and moved away of course. That was when I was maybe 22 or 23. That was the last relationship. I've been avoiding dating because I'm afraid of history repeating itself. I've been single ever since and honestly, I'm just lonely and depressed. I never spoke to a doctor about any of this. I don't know what I'd be diagnosed with but I'm afraid. \n\nFast forward to now, there's a good person in my life who likes me. I think he's interested in me....I like him too but I'm still afraid. I don't know what to do or how to behave...I don't know what a good/healthy relationship is supposed to feel like. I'm just nervous all the time and its involuntary...I can't control how I feel. The new person said that I'm hard to read. Like, he doesn't know how I feel about physical touch... I'm sure he can tell that I'm nervous. I just don't want him to think that I'm not interested in him, or that I'm disgusted of him because that's not true. \n\nFor a long time, I'd zone out...get lost in my thoughts. Oh, and nightmares. I'd have random nightmares of being attacked, violated, raped, assaulted, or just chased. Over the years I've been able to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, and that I shouldn't feel guilty or shameful. I tried practicing self love for a long time and I think it helped. I feel somewhat normal but I never really learned how to cope. \n\nI just need help. Or some advise....or encouragement.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 301, "end": 324, "span": "he was sexually abusive", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 344, "end": 977, "span": "He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do.
