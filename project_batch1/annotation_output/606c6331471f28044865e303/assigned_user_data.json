It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me.

The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.\n\nAfter, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be \"getting him excited\" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong...

What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship?\u00a0 What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need?\u00a0 Does this lead to arguments?\u00a0 Do you stay silent or withdraw?Very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as \"cold and aloof\" towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as \"critical and nagging\"). \u00a0 Regardless of \"who started it,\" these patterns can\u00a0turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship. \u00a0 If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together. \u00a0 As the patterns\u00a0slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn't leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for.

were one block over from the main event because we wanted to get food and suddenly a guy runs by and yells \"don't go that way\" but we don't see anything so we keep walking and suddenly a flood of people is running towards us and yelling \"RUN\" so we start running and we get caught in this stampede and there's people falling and tripping and suddenly i hear a loud noise and i've grown up around guns so i don't really scare easy but this sounded exactly like a gun shot and i've never run faster in my life and then we're ushered into this building and there's maybe fifty people crammed in and people including adults are crying and holding their kids, people are praying, people are calling their loved ones. i called my mom and had to tell her i loved her and that i was safe but i didn't know what was happening and to tell my dad too because he was on a plane to india and i din't even get to say goodbye to him because i left before he went to the airport and then my friend and i just kinda took charge because nobody else was and we didn't know what was going on. i have no regard for my personal safety so i ran outside to find a cop and all i hear is \"gun in custody, no dead, people injured\" so as i'm running back into the building a second wave of people starts running and i barely make it back into the building before getting trampled and there's even more people and two girls are having massive panic attacks and there was no cell service and the news wasn't updating on anything so we didn't have any information on what was happening and nobody would say anything and there were a bunch of cops outside but for an hour we were in a complete communications blackout and i thought there was a shooter and i was going to die. when i got home and i was in service i found out that there was a fight and somebody whipped out a gun and chaos ensued. i really didn't feel anything while it was happening. my hands weren't shaking at all and when i got home i couldn't even cry but today i was at the pool and walking in and outside there was chalk on the ground that said \"RUN\" and my stomach immediately dropped for no real reason and then inside there were people playing water polo and they missed the goal and the ball made the same sound i heard when i was running yesterday and after i left i got in my car and i just started crying for ten minutes. afterwards i was out with my friend and some kids ran past us and again my stomach just dropped and i was back in that moment. we saw a movie and this guy kept walking in and out of the theater and all i could think about was how there was nowhere to hide. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthat's my story. i feel like i'm just overreacting because there wasn't actually a shooter and so many other people actually have lived through shootings so in comparison this was nothing. i just don't know how to feel about all of this. i'm alternating between feeling absolutely nothing, like now as i'm typing this, and complete anxiety and crying. i know i should talk to a therapist but there's none covered by insurance in my area and my old therapist was really expensive. i'll have access to a counselor for free in college but i don't know if i can live like this for the next two months if every loud noise or sound of people running makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry and with all
