I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. \n\nMy mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. \n\nI know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.\n\nMy mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-It's all downhill from here folks.\n\nSo how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Almost up to speed\n\nI have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. \n\nIt was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for reading guys, I feel a little better, feel free to inbox me or comment!", "displayed_text": "I am too scared to live my life how I want to.

That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Almost up to speed\n\nI have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. \n\nIt was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for reading guys, I feel a little better, feel free to inbox me or comment!"}, "2330_counseling": {"id": "2330_counseling", "text": "My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months.

Hello,  \n\nI\u2019m a 25 year old woman that turns 26 in exactly two weeks, and I couldn\u2019t fathom being anymore depressed than I am now. When I was 14 and a new sophomore in high school , I met this 22 year old man (I\u2019ll call him The Man) via my friend who was 14 as well. At the time I didn\u2019t know how old he was and he and my friend\u2019s sister (16) were dating. Somehow, the man got my phone number and consistently and persistently texted me until I stopped ignoring him and began texting back. \n\nI didn\u2019t like him at first, but after weeks of texting nonstop, my 14 year old self somehow fell for him. I knew he was involved with my friend\u2019s sister, and it ate me alive, but I also had feelings for him. One day, when my mom wasn\u2019t home, I invited him over for the first time. We met at my neighborhood pool, and we sat in his car and talked in person for about an hour. When it was time for me to leave, he wrestled with me for about 10 mins trying to kiss me, and when I finally submitted, the only thing I could say was that his breath smelled. He left, and we continued to text. \n\nA week later, my friend\u2019s sister (who was in my orchestra class) gave me a note basically cursing me out for \u201ckissing her man\u201d and calling me a fat slut, which hurt because although I\u2019m no where near obese, I\u2019ve always struggled with my weight, and she knew that. I crumpled the paper up and threw it at her telling her that he has been persistently pursuing me. It was a big thing and I almost got kicked out of class. I was really hurt, but I knew I was wrong. I texted him and asked him why he told her, and he said he didn\u2019t want to keep a secret from her, and that he couldn\u2019t see me anymore. I was extremely hurt and didn\u2019t really understand what had happened. He began to ignore me, but would sometimes call me and leave messages about how sorry he was. This all took place around this time this year, the fall. \n\nI fell into a depression, being that this was my first romantic encounter, and it was so negatively toxic, I didn\u2019t know what to think or do. I stopped eating and lost a bunch of weight. Being that I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about this, my family thought I had developed an eating disorder. This lasted a couple months. Then in December, around Christmas break, I started getting prank phone calls. They would call about twice a day, and after about a week, the person came clean and turns out it was The Man.  He told me that he and my friend\u2019s sister ended things because her mom found out about their relationship. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. Elated, I told him I loved him too and agreed to being in a relationship with him. \n\nWhen school started back in January, he would come over after school every Wednesday. My single mom worked a lot, and I took advantage of that. We happily \u201cdated\u201d for exactly a month, until one day, he told me that my friend\u2019s sister wanted him back and wanted to work on their relationship. He also told me that while they were dating, they were sexually involved, something that he was not getting from me. He began breaking up with me saying that she was first. I was distraught. I thought that giving him what she could give him, would make him stay with me. While crying, I told him I would have sex with him. He decided to take me up on that offer. I told him I was scared and asked him if it would hurt and he said it would. He laid me down, and told me to open my legs. I was crying and scared, so he forced them open. I don\u2019t remember it actually happening, but I do remember after it happened, he told me to tell him that he broke me. I told him that he broke me, and he left, not changing his mind about ending things. I cried all night. \n\nHe continued to text me, and see me even while dating the sister. We would have sex, and my attachment to him became really deep, scary deep. About 2 months later, I snuck out in the middle of the night to meet him in my neighborhood and I got caught by the police. The police also found him, but let him go. They brought me home and told my mom. She was livid. She told me that she was pressing charges. She called me a slut and a whore and took my phone. I found a way to contact him and told him what was going on. My mom contacted him and wanted to meet up with him. I don\u2019t know what that meeting looked like or how it went but they met, and afterwards, he told me he couldn\u2019t talk to me anymore, and my mom didn\u2019t press charges. \n\nAbout a year later, I received an email from him saying he missed me. Our secret relationship started up again, but this time it was a bit different. His twin brother was dating this 17 year old girl that I went to school with, so naturally, the girl and I became friends to be each other\u2019s cover. We would all hangout together and one time we all were in the same bed and having sex, but not with each other. I met some of his other siblings and had to lie about my age when they said I looked so young. He would also give me alcohol. There was a time that I went on a weekend trip with him and his brother to visit their friend (24). We stayed at the Friend\u2019s house who was celebrating his girlfriend of 6 years\u2019 birthday. It was a big celebration because she was finally turning 18. The Man had friends like him and even his twin brother was like him. About a week later, I found out that he gave me chlamydia and when I told him about it, and that he was the only guy I\u2019ve ever been with, he denied it and said that I must\u2019ve gotten it from a toilet seat or something. Somehow, my entire high school found out that I had an std. I don\u2019t know how, but I continued to date him. On the same date that he broke up with me the year before, he broke up with me again, stating that I was too young. He still continued to see me and have sex with me, just without the title of being in a relationship with me. This allowed him to see other people, which I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later, my mom found out and this time actually pressed charges. She took me to talk to a detective and I remember hating her for that. I didn\u2019t tell the detective everything but I told him some things and that I loved him. The Man decided to turn himself in and I didn\u2019t talk to him again after that. My mom was extremely mad at me for months. I knew she was disappointed in me, and every chance she got, she let me know. \n\nWhen I started my senior year of high school, things were a lot more normal. My mom was trusting me again, and even got me a car. I had a boyfriend that was my age, that she approved of. One day, at a Friday high school football game, I saw The Man. I was there with my boyfriend and avoided The Man. He stared at me and watched me. When the game ended, he texted me and said that he sees I moved on. I said yeah. \n\nThe case against him was still going on. A few months passed and he contacted me begging me to ask my mom to drop the charges because he was facing 20 years. I told him that I would talk to her. He then asked me to marry him and said that if I marry him, the charges would automatically drop and that he could get us an apartment. He said we could start a family and that he would take care of us. I seriously thought about it, and then declined. I told my mom that he contacted me and she was mad at me. A few months later, I found out that she worked out a deal to bring his sentencing down to him being on probation for 10 years and being on the sex offender\u2019s list for 3 years. \n\nAt the time, my teenage self moved on from the situation very quickly. However when I turned 25 last year, all the memories and emotions I suppressed hit me like a ton of bricks. Ever since I was 16, my body has been sick. I have acne all over my body, irregular periods, mood swings, regular yeast infections and vaginal infections and have had terribly toxic relationships with men. I think that every guy I encounter has given me an STD. For the last two years, and being sexually active once out of those two years, I have been trying to convince myself that I do not have HIV even after testing negatively several times. I\u2019m starting to believe I\u2019m traumatized. \n\n I always feel like I have to please any male I encounter, and that I need to work hard and give him everything I have to avoid him leaving me. I\u2019m overtly sexual and think that I must be a pornstar in order to receive love from the male kind however, I don\u2019t really know what intimacy is. \n\nI don\u2019t have healthy relationships at all. If I befriend a female, after a couple months, I cut her off and stop talking to her. \n\nI have dreams of being a doctor, but now think that I\u2019m incapable of achieving something like that. My confidence is shot, and I hate myself. \n\nI feel guilty for The Man having to spend nearly all of his 20s on probation. I hate myself for being such a fast and loose little girl. I hate what I did to my mom and my sister. \n\nI still live at home, in the same bedroom where all of this took place and it\u2019s starting to swallow me whole. I\u2019ve been having flashbacks of what happened and I hate myself for that.\n\n I don\u2019t know who I am anymore and I\u2019m scared to interact with people or even exist on this planet. Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I\u2019m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don\u2019t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. \n\nIm in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I\u2019ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I\u2019ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can\u2019t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I\u2019ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I\u2019m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I\u2019m always alone and always will be. I\u2019m scared and I don\u2019t know what to do.", "displayed_text": "What is wrong with me? Do I have PTSD?

He also told me that while they were dating, they were sexually involved, something that he was not getting from me. He began breaking up with me saying that she was first. I was distraught. I thought that giving him what she could give him, would make him stay with me. While crying, I told him I would have sex with him. He decided to take me up on that offer. I told him I was scared and asked him if it would hurt and he said it would. He laid me down, and told me to open my legs. I was crying and scared, so he forced them open. I don\u2019t remember it actually happening, but I do remember after it happened, he told me to tell him that he broke me. I told him that he broke me, and he left, not changing his mind about ending things. I cried all night. \n\nHe continued to text me, and see me even while dating the sister. We would have sex, and my attachment to him became really deep, scary deep. About 2 months later, I snuck out in the middle of the night to meet him in my neighborhood and I got caught by the police. The police also found him, but let him go. They brought me home and told my mom. She was livid. She told me that she was pressing charges. She called me a slut and a whore and took my phone. I found a way to contact him and told him what was going on. My mom contacted him and wanted to meet up with him. I don\u2019t know what that meeting looked like or how it went but they met, and afterwards, he told me he couldn\u2019t talk to me anymore, and my mom didn\u2019t press charges. \n\nAbout a year later, I received an email from him saying he missed me. Our secret relationship started up again, but this time it was a bit different. His twin brother was dating this 17 year old girl that I went to school with, so naturally, the girl and I became friends to be each other\u2019s cover. We would all hangout together and one time we all were in the same bed and having sex, but not with each other. I met some of his other siblings and had to lie about my age when they said I looked so young. He would also give me alcohol. There was a time that I went on a weekend trip with him and his brother to visit their friend (24). We stayed at the Friend\u2019s house who was celebrating his girlfriend of 6 years\u2019 birthday. It was a big celebration because she was finally turning 18. The Man had friends like him and even his twin brother was like him. About a week later, I found out that he gave me chlamydia and when I told him about it, and that he was the only guy I\u2019ve ever been with, he denied it and said that I must\u2019ve gotten it from a toilet seat or something. Somehow, my entire high school found out that I had an std. I don\u2019t know how, but I continued to date him. On the same date that he broke up with me the year before, he broke up with me again, stating that I was too young. He still continued to see me and have sex with me, just without the title of being in a relationship with me. This allowed him to see other people, which I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later, my mom found out and this time actually pressed charges. She took me to talk to a detective and I remember hating her for that. I didn\u2019t tell the detective everything but I told him some things and that I loved him. The Man decided to turn himself in and I didn\u2019t talk to him again after that. My mom was extremely mad at me for months. I knew she was disappointed in me, and every chance she got, she let me know. \n\nWhen I started my senior year of high school, things were a lot more normal. My mom was trusting me again, and even got me a car. I had a boyfriend that was my age, that she approved of. One day, at a Friday high school football game, I saw The Man. I was there with my boyfriend and avoided The Man. He stared at me and watched me. When the game ended, he texted me and said that he sees I moved on. I said yeah. \n\nThe case against him was still going on. A few months passed and he contacted me begging me to ask my mom to drop the charges because he was facing 20 years. I told him that I would talk to her. He then asked me to marry him and said that if I marry him, the charges would automatically drop and that he could get us an apartment. He said we could start a family and that he would take care of us. I seriously thought about it, and then declined. I told my mom that he contacted me and she was mad at me. A few months later, I found out that she worked out a deal to bring his sentencing down to him being on probation for 10 years and being on the sex offender\u2019s list for 3 years. \n\nAt the time, my teenage self moved on from the situation very quickly. However when I turned 25 last year, all the memories and emotions I suppressed hit me like a ton of bricks. Ever since I was 16, my body has been sick. I have acne all over my body, irregular periods, mood swings, regular yeast infections and vaginal infections and have had terribly toxic relationships with men. I think that every guy I encounter has given me an STD. For the last two years, and being sexually active once out of those two years, I have been trying to convince myself that I do not have HIV even after testing negatively several times. I\u2019m starting to believe I\u2019m traumatized. \n\n I always feel like I have to please any male I encounter, and that I need to work hard and give him everything I have to avoid him leaving me. I\u2019m overtly sexual and think that I must be a pornstar in order to receive love from the male kind however, I don\u2019t really know what intimacy is. \n\nI don\u2019t have healthy relationships at all. If I befriend a female, after a couple months, I cut her off and stop talking to her. \n\nI have dreams of being a doctor, but now think that I\u2019m incapable of achieving something like that. My confidence is shot, and I hate myself. \n\nI feel guilty for The Man having to spend nearly all of his 20s on probation. I hate myself for being such a fast and loose little girl. I hate what I did to my mom and my sister. \n\nI still live at home, in the same bedroom where all of this took place and it\u2019s starting to swallow me whole. I\u2019ve been having flashbacks of what happened and I hate myself for that.\n\n I don\u2019t know who I am anymore and I\u2019m scared to interact with people or even exist on this planet. Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I\u2019m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don\u2019t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. \n\nIm in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I\u2019ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I\u2019ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can\u2019t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I\u2019ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I\u2019m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I\u2019m always alone and always will be. I\u2019m scared and I don\u2019t know what to do."}, "1308_counseling": {"id": "1308_counseling", "text": "I think i may suffer from depression, and it is affecting my life and sleep.
