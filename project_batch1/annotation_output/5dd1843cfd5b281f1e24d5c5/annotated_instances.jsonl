{"id": "2558_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Cant stop thinking what I did wrong When I was young, about 5 or 6, my \u201cFather\u201d started getting abusive yo me and my sister. 4 years after that started my parents got divorced and they had joint custody. It continued to get worse and worse, starting from disciplining for no reason and then at the time they divorced it it got to hitting with a closed fist every night. Then, 4 more years passed and my mom finally got full, but he had visitation every other weekend. As you can probably guess, it got worse. I was 16 when he finally tried to kill me by abandoning me up in upstate New York on a mountain with no food or water on a 12 hour hike (normally 12 hours). I got lost and too a long trail around and was out on my own for 36 more hours before I finally made it to the trail head and called the police. It took me so long because I had to free climb, I had to swim, and I had to drink from a river. That resulted in a very nasty virus that emptied my guts. The worst part of it though, was when he came to pick me up. He yelled at me and nearly decked me. He would have if it hadn't been for the officers there.\n\nIts been 4 years now and I still remember every little thing about that incident. I think back to see if I did anything to deserve all of that but I cant remember anything. Recently though I have found the love of my life and they are helping a lot.

I don't like going into details about this but when I was 15/16 my school friend went missing (we had a very small school, maybe 10 people per class? It was for ppl with mental health problems I had/have pretty severe depression and anxiety) it was just when we had finished secondary school so lots of us assumed she'd ran away from home. She hadn't and her body parts were later found and her step brother arrested for it.\nAfter this I completely shut myself off from my friends, I didn't even talk to my therapist about it (I was with CAMHS) I didn't let myself be sad about it at all. Now that I'm 20 i feel like everything reminds me of it. I can't watch anything true crime/murder related without feeling weird and everything remind me of what happened. Even GoT has been a bit much with beheadings etc... And I know I could just avoid watching stuff like that completely but you'd be surprised how often murder comes up in basically any TV show. I can't deal with dissociating everytime I think about it and see something that makes me think about it. I don't know what to do, I'm already on medication for my depression /anxiety (100mg sertraline). I just feel like I can't talk to anyone about it because not only is it horrible for me people never know what to say.\nAgain sorry if this is the wrong place to put this, all in all I'm just asking if anyone has coping methods for certain triggers I guess?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 292, "end": 338, "span": "when I was 15/16 my school friend went missing", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 585, "end": 632, "span": "She hadn't and her body parts were later found ", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 33s "}}
{"id": "465_ptsd", "displayed_text": "My brother has changed but I still remember the abuse he doesn't seem to. When I was growing up from about Grade 7 until Grade 12 my parents were abscent. My Dad lost his job and my Mum had to work all the time in order to make things work while my Dad had to travel to look for work. I have two older brothers. One went off to school and was dealing with his own suicidal feelings and anxiety. My other brother who is 8 years older than me was living at home (and still is). During that period of time the house was basically his. He was a drug addict. Lied and stole. We constantly had a parade of different people in the house that abused me in some way or another. My brother's abusive girlfriend lived with us. It seemed like it was just me, him, her and whatever person was staying in our basement at the time. They used to beat the crap out of each other. He was abusive emotionally and verbally and I remember mostly just hiding under a desk when I got home and just zoning out or not going home. I was a pretty square kid because I didn't want to be like my brother and got bullied a lot for that and I guess my \"dyke\" vibes or whatever (kids threw rocks at me at school-- kinda biblical).   \n\n\nI put all of these feelings aside for the longest time. And by \"put aisde\" I mean, I didn't deal with them and they caused a lot of problems in my development and relationships. My therapist told me that I have PTSD. I thought other sexual trauma was more responsible but, this was what my therapist always wanted to focus on. That and later my cocaine and alcohol habits when I finally snapped.  \n\n\nNow. My brother only drinks and smokes cigarettes. Lives with my parents and is pretty nice and gets help for his OCD. I do not live with my family. I moved across the country and it proved to pretty much help me to be away from them all. Problem is for me. Right now. Is that my brother has changed. But he teases me for being over sensitive and having a temper with him. He loves to tease me and I get so frustrated that I cry and feel myself since it's the same house wanting to crawl under a desk when he does this.   \n\n\nHow do you tell someone that you recognize that they have changed but, you are unable to forgive them (at least mentally because I know I can never physically forgive him due to my body having a will of its own) and that they can not have that teasing sibling relationship with you because you traumatized me too much. My brother is not a responsible person and is pretty condescending and problematic and we fight constantly....   \n\n\nI don't know what to do but, I am staying here currently until January because I live very far up North (the last town before the next town is a fly in town in the Yukon) and I need to wait for the river to completely freeze to cross it to get home.

{"id": "2601_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I don't know if this actually happened to me or not. I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;\n\n2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"new version\" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the \"original\" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a \"substitute\" memory in place of the other one?

{"id": "1303_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I am too scared to live my life how I want to. I know that the title seems dramatic, but please look at it in a literal sense. \n\n\\-Backstory Time\n\nMy mother was married four times, and her third husband, was addicted to pills. I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. \n\nMy mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. \n\nI know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.\n\nMy mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-It's all downhill from here folks.\n\nSo how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Almost up to speed\n\nI have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. \n\nIt was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for reading guys, I feel a little better, feel free to inbox me or comment!", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 376, "end": 416, "span": "when the abuse started to get really bad", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1073, "span": "I was beaten", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 56s "}}
