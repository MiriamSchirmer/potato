NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.\n\n I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.\n\nMy father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to \"discuss\" it. \"Discussion\" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining \"how things are\"- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to \"misunderstand\", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a \"discussion\". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.\n\nThis was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing \"privilegies\" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and \"llike you mean it\". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.\n\nSometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back.

NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.\n\n I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.\n\nMy father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to \"discuss\" it. \"Discussion\" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining \"how things are\"- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to \"misunderstand\", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a \"discussion\". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.\n\nThis was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing \"privilegies\" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and \"llike you mean it\".

Therapist was thinking about PTSD but after telling her that my normal doctor suspected me from having post concussion syndrome (because of the forgetfulness, headaches dizziness etc) she is waiting for other test i guess to conclude that it really is ptsd.\n\nIm really hopeless and want to do just anything to get better. So my question is can anyone relate to this or what do you advise me to tell my therapist because I really wanted to start EMDR and I feel as if it is going to take forever..\n\nSorry for the long read xx", "displayed_text": "Therapist hesitant about diagnosing me with PTSD because of other doctor claiming I have post concussion syndrome after car accidents. This is my first post ever and because i\u2019ve been a long time lurker I\u2019ve decided to ask for your guys advise because of the great support Reddit gives each other. English is not my first language so bare with me please..\n\nA little bit of background story. Started grown up job which consited of driving a lot. Had 2 car accidents in a short period of time. After the second one I couldnt take anything anymore and felt like I was having a mental meltdown. Worked since i was 14 and couldnt lift a finger after the accident. Felt like I was losing my mind literally. \n\nCouldnt talk to people normally without crying and wasnt myself anymore. Childhood things arose during therapy sessions like arguing of my parents and molestations from family member. I thought that I outgrew everything but after the accidents I cant live my normal life without thinking about the past, crying and feeling worthless. My love for people and life dissapeard as if was never there and was feeling quite suicidal without wanting to be actually dead for a long while.\n\nWas going to therapy since the beginning.
