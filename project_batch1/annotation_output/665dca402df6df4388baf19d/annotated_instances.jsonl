I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.\n\nI tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.\n\nI just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? \n\nA few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life.

His skull was off the top of his head, and his brain was being surgically worked on while everyone, including his direct supervisor, watched. One of the nurses was arguing with the one who was directly operating on his brain, and he was saying \"This is inhumane! Who ordered this?\" The other nurse replied that it was the agents direct supervisor, who was watching from above. They never knocked him out. Everyone stood by and watched him scream. He was saying \"Please, just let me die! Just let me die!\" He found the nurse who kept saying that the surgery was inhumane, and was told the truth; the memory he was brought back to was a fragment of what happened.

I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.\n\n I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.\n\nMy father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to \"discuss\" it. \"Discussion\" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining \"how things are\"- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to \"misunderstand\", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a \"discussion\". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.\n\nThis was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing \"privilegies\" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and \"llike you mean it\". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.\n\nSometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.\n\nI was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.\n\nLimited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.\n\nMy friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.\n\nI realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.\n\nThank you in advance &lt;3", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2751, "end": 3476, "span": "behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other.

{"id": "847_counseling", "displayed_text": "I need help controlling my anger. Anger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues. \u00a0 \u00a0Anger also helps us understand that there\u2019s something wrong that needs to change. \u00a0 Once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry, then we can explore the source of anger. \u00a0Ask yourself: Why am angry, Am I hurt, disappointed, confused, embarrassed etc. ?\u00a0 Once you find the answer, explore how often that happens and what\u2019s your reaction. \u00a0 Then explore how else you could respond or react. \u00a0 You could use I-statements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario. \u00a0 This is a good exercise to practice with your Counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration, especially if you have been angry for a long timeAlso, it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggression\u00a0and learn to manage our anger before we act on it. \u00a0 Anger is a feeling; aggression is when you act out your anger physically, verbally and psychologically. \u00a0 Find ways to vent: crying or sweating will help to release your anger, and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry. \u00a0 Physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotions.

{"id": "716_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD Flashbacks, maybe Disassociation My friend of 4 years had a bad flashback the other night. She has Tourettes, Anxiety, Rage Attacks, PTSD, and some more that go along with all of them. She gets PTSD from being filmed (father would film her as a child to send out to doctors) Also gets PTSD from men being aggressive and angry in her face (ex would beat her and another ex would trigger her on purpose, so this might actually be CPTSD)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the other night she was out drinking and came over at 3:30am because she was having bad Anxiety and wanted to be comforted. I get her ready for bed and went back downstairs to finish a game before I shut my PC off. She came right down and hit the back of my head. I stood up and was in shock, she threw her arms up and said \"What are you gonna do, hit me!?\" I grabbed my phone and started to record her for proof. She backed away and hid from the camera. Eventually she started to hit herself, most likely the tics from tourettes. I took the phone out again to record her and she saw me doing this and it triggered her, she took the phone and began attacking me and herself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to get my phone back to call the police but she did a good job keeping me from it, I was yelling and in her face because I was pissed. She kept attacking me and had my phone. This triggered her into a flashback I believe. Her mood completely flipped to a calm person, looked at me and said \"I forgive you if you slap the fucking shit out of me, you fucking pussy\" She then actually slapped herself and then began to choke herself why saying her ex's name. The rest of the story is the same, I eventually get my car keys and run. I get to a friends house to call the cops and meet them back at my house. I get arrested because she claims I attempted to murder her by choking her to death. I got arrested right away and the cops didn't even get my statement or ask me anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My question to you all is How can you make someone aware that an event they thought was real (flashback).. wasn't?** In her mind she thought I was doing these things to her. She had a flashback of her ex beating her. It's been two weeks and she still thinks I did all of that. I cannot contact her due to being arrested so it'll be a while unfortunately. I've attempted to reach out to her family but no response yet. I'm facing 7-10 years in prison with all the charges the cop/state put on me. I did get a lawyer so the legal side I'm not worried about here. I just want to hear your stories of these vivid flashbacks and how you can bring them back to reality, what really happened.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 223, "end": 405, "span": "father would film her as a child to send out to doctors) Also gets PTSD from men being aggressive and angry in her face (ex would beat her and another ex would trigger her on purpose", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 13s "}}
