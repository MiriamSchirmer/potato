{"id": "109_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I think i cured my violent sexual trauma and \"fetish\" by getting it to happen to me again. Is this possible? Is it sick? Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it \"rape\" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.\n\n\n At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).\n\n\nI hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be \"real raped, choked\" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.\n\n\n2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming \"OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP\" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.\n\n\nOver the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???\n\n\nTL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick \"fetish\". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts?

{"id": "916_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Is this PTSD? What do I do? (19 y/o male) About 2 months ago one night  I was delivering a pizza to an apartment building for my job. I left my car door unlocked for convenience when i just walked like 30 steps to the door to deliver it. A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. \nSince then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could\u2019ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I\u2019ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could\u2019ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I\u2019ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don\u2019t really have nightmares.\nI just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it\u2019s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I\u2019ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don\u2019t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I\u2019ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I\u2019ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I\u2019m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I\u2019ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I\u2019m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn\u2019t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn\u2019t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he\u2019s made it clear before that he doesn\u2019t generally prescribe benzodiazepines.

{"id": "893_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Some thoughts on dissociation? Not sure if this sub is the right place. Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or \"go see a therapist\" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.\n\nOkay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating/introspecting/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.\n\nEither way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.\n\nIn particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.\n\nThere is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 523, "end": 562, "span": "been through some hideous shit as a kid", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 6s "}}
