It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself).

It was totally my fault, but due to another insurance issue, I left a note with an illegible phone number. Guilty over this, I got an envelope containing several hundred dollars. Unfortunately, by the time I returned, the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away. Since I cannot make this up to that individual, how do I atone for my cowardly act?

I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   \n\nI injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  \n\nWell the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  \n\nLuckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. \n\nI looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) \n\n When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  \n\nI went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a \"cookie cutter\" plan.\n\nThey explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. \n\nAfter going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  \n\nThey truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  \n\nThey also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    \n\nWith their help I have been clean 3.5 months.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. \n\nSo today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.\n\nFor the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future....
