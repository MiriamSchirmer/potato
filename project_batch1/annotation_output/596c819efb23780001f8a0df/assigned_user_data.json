The word why can be really difficult for some people to answer because the word itself triggers an emotional reaction.Try to ask him if the two of you can discuss this in a way that you can just ask more questions about what he is experiencing. If you can listen without being defensive about what you think and feel, you may understand more about where you boyfriend is coming from.Remember that understanding what he means does not mean that you have to agree with what he is saying.Maybe he would be willing to listen to what you are experiencing and ask questions about that as you did for him.

I'm not sure whether talking with her on the phone or through some videoconferencing application (such as Skype) would be something you could do in the meantime until you sort out what you want to do.Some things I wonder are:What makes the two of them not get along?What makes him feel threatened or on edge if you visit your mother without him? What does he think will happen?What is he getting out of trying to choose for you?What is he so afraid of?If you decide to talk about these things with your boyfriend, try to do the following:Consider using questions that start with the words who, what, where, when, and not why. The word why can be really difficult for some people to answer because the word itself triggers an emotional reaction.Try to ask him if the two of you can discuss this in a way that you can just ask more questions about what he is experiencing. If you can listen without being defensive about what you think and feel, you may understand more about where you boyfriend is coming from.Remember that understanding what he means does not mean that you have to agree with what he is saying.Maybe he would be willing to listen to what you are experiencing and ask questions about that as you did for him.

I am really scared to post this because I\u2019m preempting negative or hostile responses regardless of how supportive and nice this community seems, so please be considerate if you intend to comment. Also, I probably won\u2019t look at the comments for a long time as a way to reduce the fear I\u2019ll feel when reading them. So keep that in mind if you\u2019re expecting a reply from me. \n\nI experience social anxiety a lot. And quite severely too. Even with medication and regular therapy it still affects my daily life to a great extent. \n\nFor those of you not familiar, social anxiety disorder could be summarised as an intense, usually irrational fear of being judged by others. Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it. Basically, it\u2019s a very irrational fear that I\u2019m very aware of. Regardless, I have little control over it as it is essentially instinctual, as y\u2019all probably understand. \n\nEvery now and then something will happen in my life that causes me great stress. A mundane event that becomes worse when combined with my SAD. Usually this is some form of criticism. The symptoms I\u2019ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I\u2019ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I\u2019m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. \n\nFor example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can\u2019t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn\u2019t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember. For weeks after, the topic of volleyball caused great stress to me. \n\nThe thought of practicing or going to games caused panic attacks. When I thought of the event my core would seize up, heart rate would increase, limbs would start trembling, and sometimes my breathing would speed up or become sporadic. A bit like a mini panic attack, without all the symptoms or duration (these episodes lasted a few seconds, 10 at the most).  \n\nI would avoid the topic of volleyball for weeks after, even stopping reading a book series that mentioned volleyball because it reminded me too much of the event. I would lose interest in volleyball, despite me actually really enjoying it. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years, but thinking of this instance still causes some of these symptoms, to a lesser degree. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had nightmares about this specific situation, but similar events have had negative influences on my dreams in the past. \n\nI\u2019ve provided examples of these symptoms in relation to /just one/ event, but keep in mind this still occurs for all of my most stressful experiences which are numerous. \n\nIdk. I just feel kinda bad posting this here, because there are people with legitimately debilitating symptoms from horrible experiences and I\u2019m curious about my problems, which are comparably laughable. And I\u2019m worried I\u2019m doing this \u2018for attention\u2019 or to be \u2018special\u2019, which I\u2019m not.

First things first, I in no way intend to be disrespectful, or undermine the experiences of anyone with this post. I am really scared to post this because I\u2019m preempting negative or hostile responses regardless of how supportive and nice this community seems, so please be considerate if you intend to comment. Also, I probably won\u2019t look at the comments for a long time as a way to reduce the fear I\u2019ll feel when reading them. So keep that in mind if you\u2019re expecting a reply from me. \n\nI experience social anxiety a lot. And quite severely too. Even with medication and regular therapy it still affects my daily life to a great extent. \n\nFor those of you not familiar, social anxiety disorder could be summarised as an intense, usually irrational fear of being judged by others. Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it. Basically, it\u2019s a very irrational fear that I\u2019m very aware of. Regardless, I have little control over it as it is essentially instinctual, as y\u2019all probably understand. \n\nEvery now and then something will happen in my life that causes me great stress. A mundane event that becomes worse when combined with my SAD. Usually this is some form of criticism. The symptoms I\u2019ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I\u2019ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I\u2019m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. \n\nFor example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can\u2019t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn\u2019t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember.

Inexperienced me deemed this normal, we could moved passed all of that noise - what counted was where we ended up each night. He kept nude images of these girls on his phone, we were not off to a great start. But I was practical, I was different, and I made him feel smart. I existed to embellish him, an important role - and he knew it. I was his type; insecure and accustomed to abuse. This particular trauma, however, is not abuse. Though there was plenty, emotional and physical abuse. I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it. He shoved me into a wall when I announced his lack of masculinity too loudly. \n\nHe worked in security at a ballet school, often overnight. Based on the mistrust that was instilled in me early on in our relationship, the overnight work worried me. Is he talking to girls? Is he sending them unsolicited dick pics? Probably. By this point he had convinced me it was in my head, and I was massively paranoid. I was turning into one of the girls he didn\u2019t want to be around, someone insane and impractical. But I paid rent, and contributed towards the idea of a future. I was being molded into someone who would love him no matter what doubts I had. \n\nHe had some performance issues come up at his job. I can\u2019t remember what they were regarding, or if they were even real\u2026But he lost his full time position. He maintained employment with the same company at a different location, part-time. We got by with savings and my serving job. I got a call one day from his manager, Patrick. They had originally tried to call him, and I was listed as his emergency contact. It was not the first time I had received a call from his work, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I was at work when he called so he left a voicemail - I listened to it on my way home from work. He spoke as if he were talking to him, instructing him to call him back - and that they had to cut into all of the lockers at his previous workplace. He listed off a few of the items found in the lockers and wanted to be sure that they were his, and make sure everything was accounted for. There was a laptop, and a safe box. \n\nI asked him about these items but he assured me they weren\u2019t his. I let it go, as I had many things during our time together. He was picking up a few evening shifts where he could at this time, quite sporadically. He would leave around 2 or 4, and return around 10pm. I got cut from work when the dinner shift showed up, around 4:30. I left work, walked south on Bay Street, east on College, and hopped on the northbound train. I got home around 5:15pm. I unloaded, changed into sweats, the usual. Cleaning was pretty relaxing after a day in the service industry, so I went to grab some supplies under the kitchen sink cupboard. Our kitchen counters were L shaped, and I always thought it was weird that where the space under the cupboard should have ended, it extended passed where the wall above sat. This particular evening I noticed that this was not the case, and somehow the wall had moved forward. I was frightened, I was one of those people that ready creepy stories at night - you know the one where people discover there are people living in small spaces in their home. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wall, it was a piece of bristol board. It was relieving for a brief moment - but that relief was short lived. I removed that board and discovered a safe and a laptop. Since that moment I\u2019ve really repressed what I found - through denial or embarrassment, I\u2019ve somehow forgotten in detail what it was I had seen. I still don\u2019t know what journey I set out to after that moment, but it wasn\u2019t to deal with seeing those images. That was my second mistake. My first was my initial thought - the end of my four year relationship. Logic was not present, logic would have been to immediately call the police - instead of waiting for him to come home to confront him about it.* \n\nIf he somehow sees this - he will frantically come up with something to tell you to convince you I am just some crazy ex-girlfriend out to get me for breaking up with me. Or perhaps he has already set something in place to manipulate you into believing that none of this is truth, and anything anyone ever says apart from him is a lie. When I left Toronto, he covered his tracks - and somehow convinced his family and our mutual friends that I was not to be trusted. He was fine, and merely unhappy in our relationship. He never got the help he claimed to seek, he paused his search for child pornography, but not for long. It\u2019s never for very long. Damaged people don\u2019t get better without proper treatment. \n\nI think about this every fucking day. It\u2019s with me, for better or for worse. I think about the children who attended and lived at the ballet school that he worked at - it\u2019s such a privilege for them to be there, a dream. I think about the children that were trafficked and exploited - contributing to his sick obsession. I think about the women who are trafficked in Southern Ontario. I think about his other ex-girlfriend who also knew about this. I think about his family who are under his false influence.

I existed to embellish him, an important role - and he knew it. I was his type; insecure and accustomed to abuse. This particular trauma, however, is not abuse. Though there was plenty, emotional and physical abuse. I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it. He shoved me into a wall when I announced his lack of masculinity too loudly. \n\nHe worked in security at a ballet school, often overnight. Based on the mistrust that was instilled in me early on in our relationship, the overnight work worried me. Is he talking to girls? Is he sending them unsolicited dick pics? Probably. By this point he had convinced me it was in my head, and I was massively paranoid. I was turning into one of the girls he didn\u2019t want to be around, someone insane and impractical. But I paid rent, and contributed towards the idea of a future. I was being molded into someone who would love him no matter what doubts I had. \n\nHe had some performance issues come up at his job. I can\u2019t remember what they were regarding, or if they were even real\u2026But he lost his full time position. He maintained employment with the same company at a different location, part-time. We got by with savings and my serving job. I got a call one day from his manager, Patrick. They had originally tried to call him, and I was listed as his emergency contact. It was not the first time I had received a call from his work, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I was at work when he called so he left a voicemail - I listened to it on my way home from work. He spoke as if he were talking to him, instructing him to call him back - and that they had to cut into all of the lockers at his previous workplace. He listed off a few of the items found in the lockers and wanted to be sure that they were his, and make sure everything was accounted for. There was a laptop, and a safe box. \n\nI asked him about these items but he assured me they weren\u2019t his. I let it go, as I had many things during our time together. He was picking up a few evening shifts where he could at this time, quite sporadically. He would leave around 2 or 4, and return around 10pm. I got cut from work when the dinner shift showed up, around 4:30. I left work, walked south on Bay Street, east on College, and hopped on the northbound train. I got home around 5:15pm. I unloaded, changed into sweats, the usual. Cleaning was pretty relaxing after a day in the service industry, so I went to grab some supplies under the kitchen sink cupboard. Our kitchen counters were L shaped, and I always thought it was weird that where the space under the cupboard should have ended, it extended passed where the wall above sat. This particular evening I noticed that this was not the case, and somehow the wall had moved forward. I was frightened, I was one of those people that ready creepy stories at night - you know the one where people discover there are people living in small spaces in their home. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wall, it was a piece of bristol board. It was relieving for a brief moment - but that relief was short lived. I removed that board and discovered a safe and a laptop. Since that moment I\u2019ve really repressed what I found - through denial or embarrassment, I\u2019ve somehow forgotten in detail what it was I had seen. I still don\u2019t know what journey I set out to after that moment, but it wasn\u2019t to deal with seeing those images. That was my second mistake. My first was my initial thought - the end of my four year relationship. Logic was not present, logic would have been to immediately call the police - instead of waiting for him to come home to confront him about it.* \n\nIf he somehow sees this - he will frantically come up with something to tell you to convince you I am just some crazy ex-girlfriend out to get me for breaking up with me. Or perhaps he has already set something in place to manipulate you into believing that none of this is truth, and anything anyone ever says apart from him is a lie. When I left Toronto, he covered his tracks - and somehow convinced his family and our mutual friends that I was not to be trusted. He was fine, and merely unhappy in our relationship. He never got the help he claimed to seek, he paused his search for child pornography, but not for long. It\u2019s never for very long. Damaged people don\u2019t get better without proper treatment. \n\nI think about this every fucking day. It\u2019s with me, for better or for worse. I think about the children who attended and lived at the ballet school that he worked at - it\u2019s such a privilege for them to be there, a dream. I think about the children that were trafficked and exploited - contributing to his sick obsession. I think about the women who are trafficked in Southern Ontario. I think about his other ex-girlfriend who also knew about this. I think about his family who are under his false influence. But most of all, I think of you. \n\n(*the crime described in this letter has since been reported.)"}, "Traumatic-Event-Detection-end_fin.html": {"id": "Traumatic-Event-Detection-end_fin.html", "text": "End of survey", "displayed_text": "End of survey"}}
