Feeling anxious, rotten, emotionally unregulated, helpless and hopeless and that no one is helping me. Finally asking and begging for help only to be ridiculed by hospital staff and treated insane. \n\nI took my charmain hiney to the hospital in a major panic and disassociative episode last night. Can't  sleep because my sleep are nightmares, can function bc I cant sleep. Erupted in an uncontrollable rage and panic last night because of some effed up intrusive and totally unreal thoughts.\n\nI took a Lyft bc i didn't wanna panic my boyfriend and mostly asking for help from anyone in my life or to do something about abuse has never gone well and victim blaming is a thing. You see last year my brother strangled me to unconsciousness and left me for dead. His wife absconded with their kids bc she is a nurse and didnt want to lose her job. They left me in their house to die and when my mom picked me up I was pretty beat up amd she asked me what I did....lol...All for bringing his wife home 10 minutes too late (he hates himself and her and has alway always wanted me dead bc I took everything from him...you know by not doing drugs and studying and earning scholarships for college sure seems unfair.) Cuckoo.\n\nSitting there, naked in a robe, zoned tf out with tears down my cheeks and a bag of piss sample, I could just see and hear nurses making rude gestures. It was empty in the ER and the only time I've ever felt unsafe for myself, i couldnt even feel safe there. I finally asked to be seen, they ignored me. They took all my belongings and phone and i just needed to call my fiance to pick me up bc i could feel a huge trigger (sweating profusely, rapid talk, hypervigilant). I said i really didn't want to be there so unless they're checking me in, ill go. A dude  nurse walks by and laughs \"good, go then\"......uhm all I saw was red. That's alllllll it took for me to cuss him out, threaten litigation, speak to their head staff and demand my belongings and to tell me \"tell me how tf do you act when your brother tries to kill you and you lose the only kids youl ever have niece and nephew\". They were in the wrong and the security staff apologized as did the doctor. Doesnt matter, i wont be seeking help from the er ever again and i get to deal with the embarassment of losing my shit thinking im a victim again. Ughh.\n\nI prob needed 72 hrs. Thats what i wanted. \n\nAbout me:  Im 37 years old and was diagnosed in 2017 with PTSD. A history of child physical and sexual abuse, extreme poverty, absentee parents , extreme bullying and racial prejudice from whites and blacks bc I am mixed, an emotionally abusive and cheating gay ex husband, watching friends die in front of me, painful endometriosis, bullying at work, physical attacks and most recently my brother tried to kill me.\n\nSpent all of my life ignoring the effed upness of everything because being alienated or told your different sure makes you not wanna put on anything but a happy face...until my body and brain broke, which happened one night outside of a club in 2017 when a black woman threw me to the ground and choked me because i walked by her and  apparently thought I was \"just some cute lightskinned girl.\" After, i went into a dissociation and been stuck in it since.\n\nYou see, i can write all those things down now but those are things no one knew of me. I am smart, educated, used to be kind, and definitely goofy/quick witted. My kindness has often been easy for manipulative people to exploit and since speaking up didnt work as a child, I just laughed about everything....the manager whos wife sent me nudes and tried to groom me for a threesome outta nowhere, the other manager who hated me because I excelled at what I did and ridiculed and alienated me from staff, the perverts who knew i was naive to men, etc...\n\nThere is no point to this other than asking what do you do in crisis and you feel no.one WILL help?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 756, "end": 839, "span": "You see last year my brother strangled me to unconsciousness and left me for dead.

We felt like having a little bit of fun, but only took one tab each so that I could still drive and we could just cruise around all night tripping. So skip ahead some time and at this point it was around 3am. We were driving on some back roads in a country area. We felt this was a good place to stay because it wasn't populated and no one else was on the road. There was also no police that came by this area usually. We took a turn on a road and started heading down it. This was a road we haven't been on before. It was very dark, no street lights. When we turn a corner I see blinking lights from a car and then I see that the car was smashed into a tree. I was tripping balls at this point, but I felt I couldn't not go and see if anyone was hurt or not. I pull up behind the car and my girlfriend begs me to not go. She is tripping harder then me and thinks that I am going to be attacked or something and I was going to get killed.

Hopefully this will cause my issue of being an uncomfortable person.Before i start i must specify that i am not making anything i say up or am doing this for attention. I have no idea how Reddit works, so i apologize if i don't do things that people may find mandatory. (I would appreciate They/them pronouns if you end up responding to this post please.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of your night/morning and have a wonderful week. &lt;3", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 3152, "end": 3355, "span": "Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass.
