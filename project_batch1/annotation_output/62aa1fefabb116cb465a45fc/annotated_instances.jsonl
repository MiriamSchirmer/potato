{"id": "2166_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Waking up at the same time every night (TW seeing death happen. Graphic detail.) I\u2019m no stranger to C-PTSD. I was officially diagnosed in 2017 after major trauma I dealt with at the hands of a mental health facility. \n\nI know waking up myself and the whole household screaming in my sleep, hearing sounds and voices relating to my trauma, and sleeping with the lights on for years well. I was finding my symptoms easing and being easier to deal with in late 2019 thanks to extensive therapy and working through them one by one but then my Mom died on January 1st of this year right after midnight. \n\nIt was the simple call and \u201cwe regret to inform you,\u201d no. We had went to visit her in ICU. ICU had become a normal occurrence in the infections she kept having but she always bounced back. \n\nWhen we walked in, she didn\u2019t seem any worse than the times before... and then a nurse pulled me to the side to tell me it was bad bad. \n\nI still didn\u2019t believe it, but while we were there they said they were putting her on a ventilator, and I decided to stay the night. \n\nDue to my moms infection and my slight germaphobia, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable holding her hand or being in cough range. Even before the ventilator, she couldn\u2019t respond more than panicked eyes that never looked directly at me and hoarse \u201chelp me\u201d\u2019s between breaths. I couldn\u2019t get her attention even when I did try to tell her it\u2019d be okay and to comfort her. Seeing her like that was crushing me. I decided to let the nurses do their thing while I wished everyone on my social media a happy new year. \n\nThe nurses came in and out to add meds and such to help her breathe, kicked me out to put the ventilator in, but when I was allowed back in they never were gone for more than 10 minutes. I watched my moms machine, and it didn\u2019t stop beeping since we had gotten there but that was normal when o2 levels are below 90. \n\nShe started calming down some so I laid down to sleep. I was checking my phone one last time for the night when a nurse came RUNNING in. \nThe machine hadn\u2019t made a different sound or anything but apparently my mother\u2019s heart had stopped. \n\nWithin seconds the room got filled with folks providing CPR. A doctor came in and told me to tell her if I wanted them to stop. \n\n5 minutes passed, then 7, then 10. It didn\u2019t feel like I though. I\u2019m just sitting there in shock and unsure what to do. The doctor informs me her ribs are broken and if she does suddenly make it she\u2019s gonna be in a ton of pain but at this point we were just torturing her. \n\nBlood was in her breathing tube. Her eyes looked gone. I told them to stop. \n\nI remember feeling super numb and floaty. I hadn\u2019t slept in months. My boyfriend wasn\u2019t answering the phone and I didn\u2019t know what the fuck to do but it didn\u2019t matter because I couldn\u2019t think. \n\nEventually I just allowed the numb to take over. I had hoped that numb would stay for a bit but starting around February, I started waking up every night at 12:23 no matter when I go to sleep. \n\nI know why it\u2019s happening, but at the same time, I just can\u2019t get it under control. \n\nOnce I\u2019m awake I can\u2019t go back to sleep until daylight and it\u2019s getting real old. No matter what I take I\u2019ll wake up. \n\nLuckily my job has been shut down over the Covid stuff, but I\u2019m worried about when I do have to work again. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with this?\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve read this far... thank you for listening.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 155, "end": 217, "span": "trauma I dealt with at the hands of a mental health facility.

Throwaway account. \n\nSo, this is a reallllyyyy long story, but about two years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy who I found out was lying to me and who I'm pretty certain was manipulating me. (Despite his mom and friend telling me he was manipulative and that I should stay away.) Anywho, he was very mentally ill and seeking counseling, but I think he should've gone to a residential treatment facility. Alas, he was in his twenties and no one could force him. \n\nAnyways, I have nightmares about seeing him now and I wake up feeling so panicked and anxious for a while. He would get into these extreme rages after fights with his mom, and he once told me he wanted to kill her. I was horrified, but he was acting very different than normal, so I talked him out of it. \n\nWe eventually went our separate ways and he lives very far away from me, but I still fear he will find me and hurt me, tho he never made any kind of threat against or was even mean to me. But I don't trust him at all. He also has a relationship with a new girl (she looks similar to me and his past girls in several ways, creepy) and honestly just the thought of it makes me sick. \n\nOh, and the story is worse, considering he went thru basically a psychotic break and for a couple of weeks I thought he would kill himself, but I won't get into it. \n\nI'm in a happy relationship now with a man that I trust very much and who is incredibly kind, so I know I am safe.

I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his \"voice\". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend \"Jay's\" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.\n\nThe next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with \"Jay\". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.\n\nBack when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. \n\n\n\nI knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. \n\n\nEarlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a \"shooting in the woods\" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. \n\nAnd then this happened.\n\nI'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.\n\nI don't expect any advice really.

My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I\u2019ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they\u2019d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn\u2019t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. \n\nWhen I was 18 (I\u2019m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.\n\nOn my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me. We met up and drove around, hung out at his place and divulged in deep conversations for hours on end. \n\nAfter a couple of times he became very flirtatious and made a pass at me. \nI was pretty sexually inexperienced and he knew that, in hindsight I feel as though  he fetishized my innocence (he casually) brought it up countless times. When we first started hooking  up , it was pretty vanilla and ..normal I guess.\n\n\nOvertime he began to become really aggressive and rough , he was kind of coercive and disregarded some of my boundaries. He would choke me so hard to where I would run out of air and the next day my neck would be riddled with bruises (I was okay with choking but not that extreme). I have a visceral memory of how dark and sinister his eyes looked while he would do this. \n\nOn one occasion he did something  I did NOT consent too and it really upset me, I consented you\u2019re sex but not what he did in the midst of it(I don\u2019t feel comfortable being less vague ) it wasn\u2019t I\u2019ve isolated thing, but during that instance I remember spacing out until it was over with..was paralyzed and couldn\u2019t think. He took me home and gave the impression he was oblivious and things were fine ,  I didn\u2019t tell him what I was feeling. I felt stupid because I am partially responsible for putting myself in a compromising position and allowing myself to be taken  advantage of, I also had such little value in myself that I didn\u2019t want him to stop seeing me. After a while he ghosted me, and I was devastated. I was angry and felt used and beat myself up over it for a while. \n\nHe also dated a string of girls around my age, I didn\u2019t find that off until it was over though. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone about this, I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out or to be judged but I feel like this was a tipping point into my descent of substance abuse and depression. \nThere were so many other things that contributed \nTo my depression manifesting and festering over time and this wasn\u2019t the worst thing that happened to me per-say but it was the straw that broke the camels back. \n\nI haven\u2019t had sex in 2 years  I don\u2019t date and I wish that I could go back In time and stop everything from happening. I wish I could scrub it from my mind entirely but I can\u2019t and I still have dreams about the whole ordeal. \n\n\nAny advice on how to open up about this to a therapist, I\u2019ve always felt too embarrassed to.
