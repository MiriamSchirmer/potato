Things have been going well for the most part, with the exception of a small misunderstanding that resulted in him going silent for about 2 weeks. We spoke and moved past that but last night marked our newest miscommunication.\n\nEarly in the relationship, A expressed to me that sometimes he has a hard time with seeing blood. That it makes him uncomfortable but he\u2019s good for the most part. We planned to spend this weekend together, sort of a little stay-cation. Yesterday, we arrived at our accommodations, ate a nice meal and I changed into something sexy for him. Things were going great. We had been very excited, this would have been our first time\nwaking up together. Eventually, we were intimate with each other (not the first time). During sex, I started to bleed a bit. A mild-moderate amount, but enough for him to notice. He immediately went to the bathroom and spent about 5 minutes cleaning himself off. He was very uncomfortable with it. Once we sat back down, he didn\u2019t even touch me. He\u2019s very well endowed, over 8 easily so I suspect that has something to do with it. We discussed this, and that that is most likely what caused the bleeding. He was unable to move on from it. He explained to me that he was having severe anxiety over it, and that he wasn\u2019t trying to be a jerk but that the smell/sight of blood is hard for him as he\u2019s seen so much of it in his life. He shared briefly that he\u2019s smelled blood burning, and seen wounds. I was open and listening at assured him that I want to be there for him and whatever he needs I want to try to do. Eventually, he said he needed to leave to go get his medicine(I\u2019m assuming for anxiety). He kissed me, hugged me and damn near ran out of the hotel room.\n\nI\u2019m struggling with a few feelings at the moment. I feel resentful that he left me, on a weekend we planned together, alone in a hotel room at 10pm and didn\u2019t care enough to text me and check on me last night or make sure I was safe this morning. I feel self conscious that after sex, he sat away from me on the bed as if he was repulsed by me.

I was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when I was in middle school.  His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom\u2019s house, and I was so awe-stricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time.  Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs.  My mom went to prison for that and lost her caf\u00e9.

My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison. \n   My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person\u2019s house.

{"id": "1100_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Medical PTSD - My Story I have begun to realize over the past couple of years that I have medical PTSD resulting from the treatment of a heart condition that I was born with. I have had various hospital appointments over the course of my life (now in my mid-twenties) as well as tests and a second surgery several years ago. I will require more of all of these in the future. Since I was a child I have had severe reactions when going to the hospital or even thinking about my condition and I would break down in tears as a child during appointments. I hate being touched and having to undress during appointments, I feel like I am being violated. My brain and body react to the doctors and nurses as if they were going to hurt me, I am physically and mentally terrified of even going near them and I am completely unable to consciously override this reaction. I cannot stand sounds, sights and smells that remind me of anything to do with my condition, and I will actively go out of my way to avoid them.    \n\n I have flashbacks where I involuntarily replay experiences in the hospital and similar nightmares several times per week. I've also had issues with malpractice, administrative errors and one doctor being almost emotionally abusive, deliberately exaggerating the severity of her condition so they could exercise power and authority over me as a terrified child. I've been diagnosed with a number of mental health conditions after short consultations with a GP - depression, anxiety, insomnia, health anxiety, social anxiety, but since becoming aware of the symptoms of ptsd and briefly seeing a therapist last year, it has become clear to me that undiagnosed ptsd is likely at the root of my problems.    \n\nI feel like I am constantly in fight or flight mode, I can't calm down, slow down my breathing or untense my muscles because I have so much adrenaline flowing through my body all the time. I also think I'm seeing physical symptoms from being in this state for so much of my life - tiredness, poor concentration, autoimmune disorders, etc. I',m currently contacting therapists with experience working with ptsd to see if I can finally start to get a handle on this. For a long time I've struggled with feeling like my symptoms weren't legitimate, being told by doctors and my parents that I was just making it up for attention, I was a clever girl and I needed to stop messing around, that nothing was really wrong etc, all while my trust in people continues to get worse and I use substances to try and temper down my mental and physical reactions. I think by posting my story here I just want some sort of validation that my ptsd is real and valid, that I deserve help and treatment.

Done all the one on one with counselors and need to connect in person with others who can relate.

All I could do was repeat the number. About 15 minutes later, a call back. He'd stated he was fine and downplayed his claims, citing counselors, medications, etc that he says he's accessing so they left.\n\nIn come a bunch of nasty messages. To the effect of \"if I really cared, I would have come over myself. He went on to state he'd been thrown around by members when having a bad day but he was just sad. That he has negative feelings toward them. That he'd made the mistake in trusting me and I overstepped boundaries. That civi's can't be trusted. How his last girlfriend had done the same thing to him by calling when he was just having a bad day. It was her fault the they'd roughed him up\". On and on. \n\nI could only tell him that I didn't have much choice. That I'm not their hugest fan the past couple years myself but he's expressing suicidal ideology, and I don't know who he has in his life he trusts. That no one was out to get him here and that I don't deserve to be punished for trying to do the decent human thing. And that I am not his girlfriend (only physical contact had been a quick hug as I left a few days ago). That if he reads his miles of texts it shows his PTSD in getting in the way of of non-professionals helping him right now and provided the local crisis line number. I wished him well and reminded him that I needed to be healthy and care of myself by blocking him. Done. Nothing nasty or confrontational. \n\nThing is, some stupid part of me still wants to apologize and calm him down. I'd meant no harm at all but screwed up. I'm jumping at every little sound and feel as though I'm somehow \"in trouble\" for some misdeed. I don't think my cell block even works properly but I'm afraid to look and find out. Having been brought up being held responsible for others' unpredictable actions and fists slammed on me for not measuring up to babysitting them, it can grind a person down. After how long I'm finally starting to see that in me now? Jesus.\n\nI was also just starting to get to the point in life of emotionally realizing that I'm not as obligated as I feel or as others have guilted me to feel. There's a tiny part in me that knows I don't deserve this dynamic, and even wants to say \"I don't owe you or anyone else anything. Get off my back\". It doesn't feel strong at the moment, but it's probably just tiredness, flu, and needing to go back to bed. What a bunch of high school crap.\n\nBut I do miss my home city.

Hi everyone. \n\nMy PTSD is quite disabling already, but never like this. It has never really been addressed medically due to more pressing issues regarding my mental state, which arose way before the trauma did. \n\nI have been accepted for EMDR therapy though, and had my initial assessment a few days ago. I never talk about my trauma. I used to be able to get the flashbacks out of my head before they caused any real damage, I was really really good at running from it, blocking it out, and being in complete denial. I've struggled to leave the house lately, and have completely shut down, but NEVER have I suffered this badly from PTSD in eleven years. \n\nI took a bunch of Valium before the EMDR assessment appointment and let it all spill out, everything I could remember. That night, I had my first in depth, distressing, full on and unstoppable flashback attack that I had refused to let happen when it should have happened years ago. \n\nFull on pale, sweating, shaking, dissociated, banging my head to stop the visions kind of thing. Could hardly walk, thought I was dying. This has now happened two nights in a row. If it happens again tonight, I don't know how I'll cope. \n\nIn the past, I've had a lot of issues with Valium, Xanax and Klonopin. I have stopped buying street Klonopin and Xanax, nobody will legally script them to me either. I've also stopped buying street Valium, but I still get it prescribed by any means necessary, and currently have a surplus from a script happy dentist. \n\nThese days, I'm doing better with the benzos. Recently, I've had two small slips after almost a year sober from alcohol. But I'm terrified if it happens again soon, I will either get completely and utterly fucked up, or I might break completely. \n\nI've been having thoughts about refusing to drink any liquids and waiting to die, and it scares me, because I love control, I have to be in control all the time, and I am controlling enough of myself and others to be able to stick to dehydration as a method of ending my life. Obviously, I will sedate myself to within an inch of my life until I can see a mental health professional. \n\nBut until then. I need something. A PDF of a workbook or popular self help book, resources that have helped any of you guys, printable. I'm so scared. And almost angry at myself for seeking treatment. Because although I can't bare living with such anxiety and avoidance, I also can't bare facing up to and reliving my trauma. \n\nThanks for reading. &lt;3", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 707, "end": 732, "span": "have completely shut down", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 933, "end": 1011, "span": "I had my first in depth, distressing, full on and unstoppable flashback attack", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1324, "span": "I don't know how I'll cope", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1815, "span": "'m terrified if it happens again soon", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1982, "span": "waiting to die", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1991, "end": 2001, "span": "scares me,", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2562, "end": 2614, "span": " also can't bare facing up to and reliving my trauma", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 3s "}}
{"id": "334_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Could this be considered traumatic? NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.\n\n I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.\n\nMy father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to \"discuss\" it. \"Discussion\" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining \"how things are\"- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to \"misunderstand\", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a \"discussion\". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.\n\nThis was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing \"privilegies\" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and \"llike you mean it\". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.\n\nSometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.\n\nI was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.\n\nLimited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.\n\nMy friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.\n\nI realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.\n\nThank you in advance &lt;3", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2679, "end": 2711, "span": "he'd drag me down onto the floor", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 10s "}}

{"id": "920_ptsd", "displayed_text": "sometimes I wish I was raped Now before you start typing about how I shouldn't say that and I could never want something like that to happen to me, I want you to hear me out.\n\nWhen I was little. about 6 or 7ish, something happened to me. And ever since then I still don't know if I can call it sexual assault, sexual abuse, or just a bad experience. There are several reasons I don't know what to call it. I was young but so was he. He was four hears older but I know that he knew what he was doing. But at the same time he only would have been 10 or 11 at the time. I never said no, I never said stop, and when I told him he was heavy or that something hurt or was going too far he stopped. But yet again, I was only 6 or 7 and I just thought if felt good. I remember him telling me not to tell my mom or dad, and it happened more than once. I enjoyed it at the time though, It felt good. No intercourse actually happened, but there was a lot of grinding and touching. He had me watch him \"do his thing\" and asked if I would do it too and when I said no he didn't make me.\n\nThe thing is though, I still see this person all of the time and I will for the rest of my life probably. We have never talked about it, but I don't even know if he'd remember it. This person has always been violent and has a history of abusing my parents and me physically, along with \"anger management\" classes when he was about 10 or 13, I don't really remember. That's another thing. I don't really remember all that happened, it was over ten years ago. I remember some of it but not all of it.\n\nNow this is why I wish I had been raped. When I was in the fifth grade I started self harming. Not cutting, I hadn't even heard of that. Instead I would dig my nails into my skin and scratch until I bleed, this happened whenever I thought about what happened because I thought I did something wrong. After I told my friend (Who I'm still extremely close with to this day) about it I kind of just forgot about it every few months until when I started to hit puberty and feel sexual about anything. This was about seventh grade. I had just learned what rape was and then I remembered what happened to me and I wrote it down in my diary. The nexy day I blacked it all out with a marker.\n\nIn eighth grade I had a male teacher for homeroom who taught many of my classes. I would feel constant anxiety when he walked around the room because even the thought of him coming behind me scared me so much I was shaking. Now the weird part was he was my favorite teacher and at the time my favorite adult. So sometimes I would stay up from lunch and talk to him about anxiety and such. But at the same time, I was scared out of my mind that he was going to do something to me. Now keep in mind, this was the most innocent, sweetest teacher, nicest adult and teacher I knew at the time, and yes he was a history teacher, fulfilling the stereotype. But Even though I trusted him more than pretty much anyone at the time, I still was in a constant state of fear when he walked around the room. I thought putting myself in uncomfortable situations like seeing him during lunch would help me to trust him more and it actually did. Things got better, even though I never did tell him what had happened when I was little. in eighth grade a started to scratch myself more and a few of my friends noticed. It was on and off but by then end of the year I had stopped.\n\nWhen high school started I was a nervous wreck. I was starting a new school where I didn't know anybody. So obviously, little old me began to think that the first friend I made there would be my best friends, so I told a lot of people. By a lot I mean like 7 or 8. Some of them I still talk to, but a lot of them I told because they themselves had been assaulted. So early into freshman year I had my first kiss, which led to my first make out session. Of course I freak out because there's this heavy weight on top of me and I hadn't control anything. My heart started to race and I had a hard time breathing. I was having an anxiety attack. That's when I started cutting. All of freshman year I was cutting on and off. Nowhere anyone could see though. The next few months things got better and worse all the time. One week I'd be fine and the next I'd be scared to go home because the person that did that to me would be back there. About February I had my first boyfriend. I told him about it and whenever I would start freaking out when we were doing something he would be totoally okay with it and just make sure I was okay. Truly a great guy. We broke up after about 9 months. I didn't have a lot of trouble with him sexually but when I did it was bad. We never had sex though. To this day I am still a virgin.\n\nNow I'm a sophomore in high school and for the past few months as I've been pleasuring myself and such, I would start crying. It's not like any of the things I was doing to myself he had done to me, but I would constantly think of someone, him, another man, holding me against my will and raping me or forcing me to do things. What happened to me was not anywhere this close to extreme, and sometimes I feel like I just need to get over myself and deal with it because nothing really bad happened. But something did happen, and Sometimes I feel like it was my fault and I was in the wrong and I wasn't abused or anything and it was just kids being kids. But on the other hand I remember him knowing exactly what to do and how to make himself feel good.\n\nI know he took advantage of me. But cutting since fifth grade and being in a constant state of fear of my eighth grade history teacher doesn't add up from what he did. It's not like he forced me to do anything. I've read so many articles, I've contacted Planned Parenthood and RAINN chatrooms asking them if I'd even been abused. They all said that's up for me to decide. Maybe it wasn't the thing that happened to me though. Maybe it was the fact that he would hit my mom my dad and me and that put the fear into my head. I don't know what caused it but I feel like I'm overreacting but I just can't help the anxiety and the tears and the thought of some man inside of me whenever I touch myself. But it just doesn't add up.\n\nI do sometimes wish I was raped. It would make life clearer. It might cause more trauma but at least I would know it wasn't my fault. At least I would know it was assault or I would know it was abuse. at least I would have the courage to tell an adult and not have them judge me thinking that I was just some horny kid who messed around with a family member because I was such a horny child. I would know why I feel so exposed and preyed on. Because right now I have no idea why I feel this sort of... I don't even know if you can call it PTSD.\n\nI know people who have been raped will tell me to never wish this upon myself but I really do. It might make my life harder, but I won't have to question everything I do and think to myself that I'm an attention seeker even when I never told anybody some of this information. If you still feel as though you need to tell me I'm a terrible person, go right ahead.

Heads up - most likely triggering. \n\nHi Reddit! Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.\n\nI've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs.

She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. \n\nAm I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? \n\nTL;DR:\nSevere C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled. Am I overreacting or do I need to find a new therapist?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 209, "end": 310, "span": "significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 342, "end": 360, "span": "hospitalized twice", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 410, "end": 422, "span": "lost my job.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 520, "end": 534, "span": "ttempt suicide", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 624, "end": 650, "span": "I've been on too many meds", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 770, "end": 809, "span": "severe depression, recurrent, psychotic", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 5s "}}
