Yesterday, we arrived at our accommodations, ate a nice meal and I changed into something sexy for him. Things were going great. We had been very excited, this would have been our first time\nwaking up together. Eventually, we were intimate with each other (not the first time). During sex, I started to bleed a bit. A mild-moderate amount, but enough for him to notice. He immediately went to the bathroom and spent about 5 minutes cleaning himself off. He was very uncomfortable with it. Once we sat back down, he didn\u2019t even touch me. He\u2019s very well endowed, over 8 easily so I suspect that has something to do with it. We discussed this, and that that is most likely what caused the bleeding. He was unable to move on from it.

Tried to help - feel like I really screwed up, feel like maybe I didn't.\n\nSorry if I ramble, I'm a bit shaken up. I was recently introduced to someone who also has PTSD. I was a bit reluctant to connect but decided to be cautiously optimistic as there aren't many ways to meet people here (besides bars) or any local PTSD peer/group resources in our area for civilians. Done all the one on one with counselors and need to connect in person with others who can relate. Knowing to be careful in any case, and not looking for dating (and making that clear to him), we met a only a few times and chatted about how to address PTSD symptoms in a healthy manner. Friendly and polite, encouraging his engagement with hobbies while having some laughs as we seemed to share the same type of humour. Just decent human stuff.\n\nFast forward to today. Another invitation but me declining as I'm sicker than a dog with fever and chills. Christ if I didn't suddenly get multiple messages about how he'd received bad news and was in the middle of a PTSD episode. On to how I grounded him and helped him think clearer and had hopes I'd find him attractive, etc. Then sharing how missed his army buddies who'd died and wanted to give up as life is too painful. Over and over again. I tried calling but he wouldn't pick up. Just more messages of the same nature. And more.\n\nIt's an unsettling position and my heart was going out to him. I used to have the same dark thoughts time to time. There was also more than one occasion as a kid where someone gouged their wrists open in front of me or I had to hold them down because they were trying to throw themselves in harms way.\n\nNot knowing his family or anyone he might know, I looked up and called a vet line asking if they could help out. They instructed me contact the local RCMP. I did so, explaining the above and asking if they could just make sure he was okay.\n\nThey advised me to keep him engaged in conversation if I could while they sent someone over. Cut short our call when his doorbell rang. A few moments later, the RCMP called me back asking about his phone as it was going straight to voicemail and he had all his lights out and curtains drawn. All I could do was repeat the number. About 15 minutes later, a call back. He'd stated he was fine and downplayed his claims, citing counselors, medications, etc that he says he's accessing so they left.\n\nIn come a bunch of nasty messages. To the effect of \"if I really cared, I would have come over myself. He went on to state he'd been thrown around by members when having a bad day but he was just sad. That he has negative feelings toward them. That he'd made the mistake in trusting me and I overstepped boundaries. That civi's can't be trusted. How his last girlfriend had done the same thing to him by calling when he was just having a bad day. It was her fault the they'd roughed him up\". On and on. \n\nI could only tell him that I didn't have much choice. That I'm not their hugest fan the past couple years myself but he's expressing suicidal ideology, and I don't know who he has in his life he trusts. That no one was out to get him here and that I don't deserve to be punished for trying to do the decent human thing. And that I am not his girlfriend (only physical contact had been a quick hug as I left a few days ago). That if he reads his miles of texts it shows his PTSD in getting in the way of of non-professionals helping him right now and provided the local crisis line number.

Tried to help - feel like I really screwed up, feel like maybe I didn't.\n\nSorry if I ramble, I'm a bit shaken up. I was recently introduced to someone who also has PTSD. I was a bit reluctant to connect but decided to be cautiously optimistic as there aren't many ways to meet people here (besides bars) or any local PTSD peer/group resources in our area for civilians. Done all the one on one with counselors and need to connect in person with others who can relate. Knowing to be careful in any case, and not looking for dating (and making that clear to him), we met a only a few times and chatted about how to address PTSD symptoms in a healthy manner. Friendly and polite, encouraging his engagement with hobbies while having some laughs as we seemed to share the same type of humour. Just decent human stuff.\n\nFast forward to today. Another invitation but me declining as I'm sicker than a dog with fever and chills. Christ if I didn't suddenly get multiple messages about how he'd received bad news and was in the middle of a PTSD episode. On to how I grounded him and helped him think clearer and had hopes I'd find him attractive, etc. Then sharing how missed his army buddies who'd died and wanted to give up as life is too painful. Over and over again. I tried calling but he wouldn't pick up. Just more messages of the same nature. And more.\n\nIt's an unsettling position and my heart was going out to him. I used to have the same dark thoughts time to time. There was also more than one occasion as a kid where someone gouged their wrists open in front of me or I had to hold them down because they were trying to throw themselves in harms way.\n\nNot knowing his family or anyone he might know, I looked up and called a vet line asking if they could help out. They instructed me contact the local RCMP. I did so, explaining the above and asking if they could just make sure he was okay.\n\nThey advised me to keep him engaged in conversation if I could while they sent someone over. Cut short our call when his doorbell rang. A few moments later, the RCMP called me back asking about his phone as it was going straight to voicemail and he had all his lights out and curtains drawn. All I could do was repeat the number. About 15 minutes later, a call back. He'd stated he was fine and downplayed his claims, citing counselors, medications, etc that he says he's accessing so they left.\n\nIn come a bunch of nasty messages. To the effect of \"if I really cared, I would have come over myself. He went on to state he'd been thrown around by members when having a bad day but he was just sad. That he has negative feelings toward them. That he'd made the mistake in trusting me and I overstepped boundaries. That civi's can't be trusted. How his last girlfriend had done the same thing to him by calling when he was just having a bad day. It was her fault the they'd roughed him up\". On and on. \n\nI could only tell him that I didn't have much choice. That I'm not their hugest fan the past couple years myself but he's expressing suicidal ideology, and I don't know who he has in his life he trusts. That no one was out to get him here and that I don't deserve to be punished for trying to do the decent human thing. And that I am not his girlfriend (only physical contact had been a quick hug as I left a few days ago). That if he reads his miles of texts it shows his PTSD in getting in the way of of non-professionals helping him right now and provided the local crisis line number. I wished him well and reminded him that I needed to be healthy and care of myself by blocking him. Done.

And ever since then I still don't know if I can call it sexual assault, sexual abuse, or just a bad experience. There are several reasons I don't know what to call it. I was young but so was he. He was four hears older but I know that he knew what he was doing. But at the same time he only would have been 10 or 11 at the time. I never said no, I never said stop, and when I told him he was heavy or that something hurt or was going too far he stopped. But yet again, I was only 6 or 7 and I just thought if felt good. I remember him telling me not to tell my mom or dad, and it happened more than once. I enjoyed it at the time though, It felt good. No intercourse actually happened, but there was a lot of grinding and touching. He had me watch him \"do his thing\" and asked if I would do it too and when I said no he didn't make me.\n\nThe thing is though, I still see this person all of the time and I will for the rest of my life probably. We have never talked about it, but I don't even know if he'd remember it. This person has always been violent and has a history of abusing my parents and me physically, along with \"anger management\" classes when he was about 10 or 13, I don't really remember. That's another thing. I don't really remember all that happened, it was over ten years ago. I remember some of it but not all of it.\n\nNow this is why I wish I had been raped. When I was in the fifth grade I started self harming. Not cutting, I hadn't even heard of that. Instead I would dig my nails into my skin and scratch until I bleed, this happened whenever I thought about what happened because I thought I did something wrong. After I told my friend (Who I'm still extremely close with to this day) about it I kind of just forgot about it every few months until when I started to hit puberty and feel sexual about anything. This was about seventh grade. I had just learned what rape was and then I remembered what happened to me and I wrote it down in my diary. The nexy day I blacked it all out with a marker.\n\nIn eighth grade I had a male teacher for homeroom who taught many of my classes. I would feel constant anxiety when he walked around the room because even the thought of him coming behind me scared me so much I was shaking. Now the weird part was he was my favorite teacher and at the time my favorite adult. So sometimes I would stay up from lunch and talk to him about anxiety and such. But at the same time, I was scared out of my mind that he was going to do something to me. Now keep in mind, this was the most innocent, sweetest teacher, nicest adult and teacher I knew at the time, and yes he was a history teacher, fulfilling the stereotype. But Even though I trusted him more than pretty much anyone at the time, I still was in a constant state of fear when he walked around the room. I thought putting myself in uncomfortable situations like seeing him during lunch would help me to trust him more and it actually did. Things got better, even though I never did tell him what had happened when I was little. in eighth grade a started to scratch myself more and a few of my friends noticed. It was on and off but by then end of the year I had stopped.\n\nWhen high school started I was a nervous wreck. I was starting a new school where I didn't know anybody. So obviously, little old me began to think that the first friend I made there would be my best friends, so I told a lot of people. By a lot I mean like 7 or 8. Some of them I still talk to, but a lot of them I told because they themselves had been assaulted. So early into freshman year I had my first kiss, which led to my first make out session. Of course I freak out because there's this heavy weight on top of me and I hadn't control anything. My heart started to race and I had a hard time breathing. I was having an anxiety attack. That's when I started cutting. All of freshman year I was cutting on and off. Nowhere anyone could see though. The next few months things got better and worse all the time. One week I'd be fine and the next I'd be scared to go home because the person that did that to me would be back there. About February I had my first boyfriend. I told him about it and whenever I would start freaking out when we were doing something he would be totoally okay with it and just make sure I was okay. Truly a great guy. We broke up after about 9 months. I didn't have a lot of trouble with him sexually but when I did it was bad. We never had sex though. To this day I am still a virgin.\n\nNow I'm a sophomore in high school and for the past few months as I've been pleasuring myself and such, I would start crying. It's not like any of the things I was doing to myself he had done to me, but I would constantly think of someone, him, another man, holding me against my will and raping me or forcing me to do things. What happened to me was not anywhere this close to extreme, and sometimes I feel like I just need to get over myself and deal with it because nothing really bad happened. But something did happen, and Sometimes I feel like it was my fault and I was in the wrong and I wasn't abused or anything and it was just kids being kids. But on the other hand I remember him knowing exactly what to do and how to make himself feel good.\n\nI know he took advantage of me. But cutting since fifth grade and being in a constant state of fear of my eighth grade history teacher doesn't add up from what he did. It's not like he forced me to do anything. I've read so many articles, I've contacted Planned Parenthood and RAINN chatrooms asking them if I'd even been abused. They all said that's up for me to decide. Maybe it wasn't the thing that happened to me though. Maybe it was the fact that he would hit my mom my dad and me and that put the fear into my head. I don't know what caused it but I feel like I'm overreacting but I just can't help the anxiety and the tears and the thought of some man inside of me whenever I touch myself. But it just doesn't add up.\n\nI do sometimes wish I was raped. It would make life clearer. It might cause more trauma but at least I would know it wasn't my fault. At least I would know it was assault or I would know it was abuse. at least I would have the courage to tell an adult and not have them judge me thinking that I was just some horny kid who messed around with a family member because I was such a horny child. I would know why I feel so exposed and preyed on. Because right now I have no idea why I feel this sort of... I don't even know if you can call it PTSD.\n\nI know people who have been raped will tell me to never wish this upon myself but I really do. It might make my life harder, but I won't have to question everything I do and think to myself that I'm an attention seeker even when I never told anybody some of this information. If you still feel as though you need to tell me I'm a terrible person, go right ahead.

Heads up - most likely triggering. \n\nHi Reddit! Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.\n\nI've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs. The problem is that my current primary therapist (seeing her for a year) doesn't believe in diagnoses. She believes I'm able to get past everything that has happened so I can function like a \"normal\" person. She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. \n\nAm I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? \n\nTL;DR:\nSevere C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled.

Heads up - most likely triggering. \n\nHi Reddit! Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.\n\nI've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs. The problem is that my current primary therapist (seeing her for a year) doesn't believe in diagnoses. She believes I'm able to get past everything that has happened so I can function like a \"normal\" person. She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. \n\nAm I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? \n\nTL;DR:\nSevere C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled.

I hate being touched and having to undress during appointments, I feel like I am being violated. My brain and body react to the doctors and nurses as if they were going to hurt me, I am physically and mentally terrified of even going near them and I am completely unable to consciously override this reaction. I cannot stand sounds, sights and smells that remind me of anything to do with my condition, and I will actively go out of my way to avoid them.    \n\n I have flashbacks where I involuntarily replay experiences in the hospital and similar nightmares several times per week. I've also had issues with malpractice, administrative errors and one doctor being almost emotionally abusive, deliberately exaggerating the severity of her condition so they could exercise power and authority over me as a terrified child. I've been diagnosed with a number of mental health conditions after short consultations with a GP - depression, anxiety, insomnia, health anxiety, social anxiety, but since becoming aware of the symptoms of ptsd and briefly seeing a therapist last year, it has become clear to me that undiagnosed ptsd is likely at the root of my problems.    \n\nI feel like I am constantly in fight or flight mode, I can't calm down, slow down my breathing or untense my muscles because I have so much adrenaline flowing through my body all the time. I also think I'm seeing physical symptoms from being in this state for so much of my life - tiredness, poor concentration, autoimmune disorders, etc. I',m currently contacting therapists with experience working with ptsd to see if I can finally start to get a handle on this. For a long time I've struggled with feeling like my symptoms weren't legitimate, being told by doctors and my parents that I was just making it up for attention, I was a clever girl and I needed to stop messing around, that nothing was really wrong etc, all while my trust in people continues to get worse and I use substances to try and temper down my mental and physical reactions. I think by posting my story here I just want some sort of validation that my ptsd is real and valid, that I deserve help and treatment.
