It\u2019s been a rough two years since filled with antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs and I\u2019m looking towards psychotherapy and any advice for help. My ultimate goal is to return to my life medication free. I am scheduled to meet with a psychotherapist this Thursday, so letting everyone know that I\u2019m taking the next steps to better myself already.I will get into my symptoms down below but wanted to start out with a bit of background\n\nI had my intital outburst in a scientific laboratory. I was working really hard towards my masters degree and studying for my mcat when I lost my shit basically. I wasn\u2019t honest with my advisor about how much I thought the work was pushing me to my limits and wasn\u2019t taking my mental health as a priority. I became paranoid believing my colleagues and friends were out to get me. I stayed up for three days without sleep and I had an extreme accident when could have blinded me with scientific materials from the lab. From my stay in the psychiatric hold, my family visited me but they held me for so long because I couldn't come to about all my paranoid thoughts. Eventually, they did die down with the medication and I never saw any hallucinations or voices. I was diagnosed with Bipolar.\n\nSince then, I am quite functional in everyday life. I don't get out of the house much and my social life is lame, and I also don't have a girlfriend. I have a job now but I do still have a few symptoms that I wish would be relieved. I am easily reminded of people from my old work setting and I think things have hidden meanings sometimes. At my worst, I actually thought I was communicating telepathically with a secret society because they wanted my intellectual value in their recruitment. I'll have ideas of reference where I believe people in public are specifically talking about something associated with me.\n\nI think a lot of my issue is that I\u2019m critical of people and critical of myself. I know that it could be underneath all this that I have low self esteeem and maybe that I even didn\u2019t have enough confidence in myself to do the work that I was doing before my accident.\n\nAm I even more out there to think that this sort of paranoia will sustain ever? I've been medicated which makes me think this is not a biological problem but rather a psychological one. I believe that with the right help and my own willpower that I can overcome my past and lead the life I want to live. I feel like if I were to socialize more and even get a girlfriend that my life would be better and less stressful.\n\nAlso, what should I expect from the psychotherapist? Will it be one of the therapist who believe medicine is the answer or one like some of my previous therapists that think I can overcome this without medication. I wanted to try psychotherapy mainly because of Jordan B Peterson and is youtube videos I've watched.

I am scheduled to meet with a psychotherapist this Thursday, so letting everyone know that I\u2019m taking the next steps to better myself already.I will get into my symptoms down below but wanted to start out with a bit of background\n\nI had my intital outburst in a scientific laboratory. I was working really hard towards my masters degree and studying for my mcat when I lost my shit basically. I wasn\u2019t honest with my advisor about how much I thought the work was pushing me to my limits and wasn\u2019t taking my mental health as a priority. I became paranoid believing my colleagues and friends were out to get me. I stayed up for three days without sleep and I had an extreme accident when could have blinded me with scientific materials from the lab. From my stay in the psychiatric hold, my family visited me but they held me for so long because I couldn't come to about all my paranoid thoughts. Eventually, they did die down with the medication and I never saw any hallucinations or voices. I was diagnosed with Bipolar.\n\nSince then, I am quite functional in everyday life. I don't get out of the house much and my social life is lame, and I also don't have a girlfriend. I have a job now but I do still have a few symptoms that I wish would be relieved. I am easily reminded of people from my old work setting and I think things have hidden meanings sometimes. At my worst, I actually thought I was communicating telepathically with a secret society because they wanted my intellectual value in their recruitment. I'll have ideas of reference where I believe people in public are specifically talking about something associated with me.\n\nI think a lot of my issue is that I\u2019m critical of people and critical of myself. I know that it could be underneath all this that I have low self esteeem and maybe that I even didn\u2019t have enough confidence in myself to do the work that I was doing before my accident.\n\nAm I even more out there to think that this sort of paranoia will sustain ever? I've been medicated which makes me think this is not a biological problem but rather a psychological one. I believe that with the right help and my own willpower that I can overcome my past and lead the life I want to live. I feel like if I were to socialize more and even get a girlfriend that my life would be better and less stressful.\n\nAlso, what should I expect from the psychotherapist? Will it be one of the therapist who believe medicine is the answer or one like some of my previous therapists that think I can overcome this without medication. I wanted to try psychotherapy mainly because of Jordan B Peterson and is youtube videos I've watched. Plus, I didn't feel that much of a connection and want to be picky if I'm paying to talk to somebody."}, "2651_ptsd": {"id": "2651_ptsd", "text": "Need it out of my system TW: S*XUAL ASSAULT\n\nSo I think watching a crime show today where a woman was sexually harassed and not taken seriously, then hurt badly, triggered me?

I'm sorry if I'm ignorant and offend anyone who does have to deal with PTSD everyday, but here's my story:\n\nEver since I joined the military 3+ years ago at the age of 23, my life has improved dramatically, I was truly happy and felt like myself. I was doing \"wild\" things like partying and clubbing on the weekends and even one night stands with strangers from the bar or online dating apps, and other \"wild fun\" things (that I prefer not to mention for the sake of my career) I would NEVER thought I'd do based on who I \"was\" prior military.\n\nHowever, the happier I'm becoming the more angrier I have been getting lately thinking about my past. I'm talking about being cheerful and jolly one minute, singing with the radio driving home from work then suddenly out of no where I'll have flashbacks of shitty times in my childhood    and next thing you know I'm punching my steering wheel and clenching my jaw and just really want to fly back across the United States just to give my family whom I RARELY talk to now, a piece of my mind.\n\n I grew up in a conservative Chinese family. Being a Chinese male, I had a very \"stereotypical\" boring childhood and even lamer time in highschool and college. However, I was not a good student and was a handful as a child that I will admit but I have never thought that my family was abusive until lately and even talked to my co-workers about it.\n\nTo keep things from getting too long I'll list out the things I experienced growing up and always thought was normal until my coworkers and friends pointed out it really wasn't:\n\n- I was strongly influenced to not have friends and always put my family before anyone.\n\n- Even until I was 22 years old I was not to be trusted to have friends over the house without an adult or my brother whom was allowed to have friends over anytime he pleased since he was 18\n\n- My brother (5 years older than me) got to decide whether I can go out or must stay home regardless if there was a reason or not.\n\n- My brother can also tell me I can't have any friends over even when I was 21 years old and still lived with me and my parents.\n\n- My brother would enforce me as a child to \"pat-down\" all my friends who came over to the apartment we lived in to ensure nobody stole anything. This rule did not apply to my brother's friends.\n\n- My mother has threatened to kill herself  and me multiple times when I was a child growing up. Sometimes she would take a meat cleaver to her neck and scream at me and my brother that shes going to cut her head off and kill herself because of us. And sometimes -\n\n- My mother would swerve into the wrong side of the road towards oncoming traffic when we were bad, threatening to kill us and herself.\n\n- When my brother was old enough to drive and he would also swerve into oncoming traffic if I he was mad at me or if we got into a disagreement.\n\n- Ironically, when I was old enough to drive, I also did the same thing to a friend who is still considered one of my closest friend to this day. He pissed me off and I thought threatening his life would help me win the argument.\n\n- I also remember when I was very young my mom told me not to go outside because I had some kind of allergy or Asthma, I did not listen and helped my grandma with her yard because she was going to pay me 20$. I told her and she put her hands around my neck shook my neck and told me she was going to kill me, very angrily and very convincing at least at the time to me.\n\n- More less severe things is that my brother acted like he owned me, like if I wanted to go out and my mother said I could and my brother said I can't he would threaten to take away my games.\n\n- whenever he disallowed me to do things he would sometimes include statements like \"not in my house\" this fucking bitch didn't own shit. He's had three cars handed to him and gave me shit and tried to claim he bought one of the my mom bought him brand new, which I confronted my mom about. \n\n- I believe my step-dad might have caught on to my brother's bullshit and convinced my mom and him that it was time for him to move out.\n\nAnyways , I literally just started having angry flashbacks just now while writing the last three. I think I have more of a grudge towards my brother than my mother. I'll stop here before I go on forever but thank you for those who read this far, I honestly feel that I needed this more to vent than to really seek an answer.", "displayed_text": "Do I have PTSD? I'm sorry if I'm ignorant and offend anyone who does have to deal with PTSD everyday, but here's my story:\n\nEver since I joined the military 3+ years ago at the age of 23, my life has improved dramatically, I was truly happy and felt like myself. I was doing \"wild\" things like partying and clubbing on the weekends and even one night stands with strangers from the bar or online dating apps, and other \"wild fun\" things (that I prefer not to mention for the sake of my career) I would NEVER thought I'd do based on who I \"was\" prior military.\n\nHowever, the happier I'm becoming the more angrier I have been getting lately thinking about my past. I'm talking about being cheerful and jolly one minute, singing with the radio driving home from work then suddenly out of no where I'll have flashbacks of shitty times in my childhood    and next thing you know I'm punching my steering wheel and clenching my jaw and just really want to fly back across the United States just to give my family whom I RARELY talk to now, a piece of my mind.\n\n I grew up in a conservative Chinese family.
