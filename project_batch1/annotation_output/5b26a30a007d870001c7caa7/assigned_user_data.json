Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. \n\nHey Everyone,   \nFirst time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   \n\n\n1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. \n2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. \n3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him \"If you're gonna hit me, do it!\" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said \"Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her\". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me \"oh I fight with my brothers too!\" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. \n4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. \n5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that \"if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault\".   \n\n\nIn my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole \"PTSD\" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   \nIdk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life).

C had a partner and C told me C felt like C cheated and i reassured C that it was ok and that we don't have to talk about it ever again and we can pretend it didn't happen and this relieved C.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthen a couple of years later i decide to end it with some of the people in the group, including C, because they're toxic. C then, after telling her this, tells me that I r\\*ped her that night and told everyone imaginable that i was some rapist monster. everyone shunned me and i was completely alone. C told their relatives and they wanted to talk so then i told my parents and it was the most embarassing thing to have to explain. we eventually moved away and i'm starting to find peace but being told i r\\*ped somebody when really i was the one who was sexually and mentally taken advantage of has given me severe PTSD (i've seen a therapist about this for about a year now) and also developed into a host of other problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe biggest problem i have is that i fear so much to go out in public. i fear that everyone knows and thinks i'm disgusting and ontop of all that i feel disgusting. my body was basically used and thrown away by C and even after C did this to me and told the school i was a r\\*pist, one of our mututal friends who still talked to me told me C said that i \"had a nice d\\*ck\" like what the fuck. i feel so much shame and  violated, uneasy, disgusting, etc. and i've felt like this for almost the majority of my life now because i had no way to cope with it or deal with it healthily until seeing a therapist recently. i feel so damaged and i blame myself honestly for even getting into that situation to begin with. i wish i could've gotten away but it seems like C will always loom over me and have power over me because C is a \"victim...\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif anyone has any helpful advice of how i can move past this please help. it's becoming unbearable to deal with. thank you and sorry for the long, drawn out story"}, "2536_ptsd": {"id": "2536_ptsd", "text": "[CW childhood abuse] My rabbit is sick and I'm losing it.
