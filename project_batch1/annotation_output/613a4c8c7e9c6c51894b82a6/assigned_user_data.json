I get her ready for bed and went back downstairs to finish a game before I shut my PC off. She came right down and hit the back of my head. I stood up and was in shock, she threw her arms up and said \"What are you gonna do, hit me!?\" I grabbed my phone and started to record her for proof. She backed away and hid from the camera. Eventually she started to hit herself, most likely the tics from tourettes. I took the phone out again to record her and she saw me doing this and it triggered her, she took the phone and began attacking me and herself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to get my phone back to call the police but she did a good job keeping me from it, I was yelling and in her face because I was pissed. She kept attacking me and had my phone. This triggered her into a flashback I believe. Her mood completely flipped to a calm person, looked at me and said \"I forgive you if you slap the fucking shit out of me, you fucking pussy\" She then actually slapped herself and then began to choke herself why saying her ex's name. The rest of the story is the same, I eventually get my car keys and run. I get to a friends house to call the cops and meet them back at my house. I get arrested because she claims I attempted to murder her by choking her to death. I got arrested right away and the cops didn't even get my statement or ask me anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My question to you all is How can you make someone aware that an event they thought was real (flashback).. wasn't?** In her mind she thought I was doing these things to her. She had a flashback of her ex beating her. It's been two weeks and she still thinks I did all of that. I cannot contact her due to being arrested so it'll be a while unfortunately. I've attempted to reach out to her family but no response yet. I'm facing 7-10 years in prison with all the charges the cop/state put on me. I did get a lawyer so the legal side I'm not worried about here. I just want to hear your stories of these vivid flashbacks and how you can bring them back to reality, what really happened.", "displayed_text": "PTSD Flashbacks, maybe Disassociation My friend of 4 years had a bad flashback the other night. She has Tourettes, Anxiety, Rage Attacks, PTSD, and some more that go along with all of them. She gets PTSD from being filmed (father would film her as a child to send out to doctors) Also gets PTSD from men being aggressive and angry in her face (ex would beat her and another ex would trigger her on purpose, so this might actually be CPTSD)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the other night she was out drinking and came over at 3:30am because she was having bad Anxiety and wanted to be comforted.
