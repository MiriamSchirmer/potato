He has ptsd and agoraphobia, mostly untreated for the majority of our time together. I finally convinced him to get some counseling maybe 6 months ago, and now he talks to a nice woman in the phone once a week, who seems helpful, and he has made some great strides recently in getting out more.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a large pile of issues between the agoraphobia and the ptsd, but what I\u2019m curious about today is the personality shift that tends to happen when he gets triggered and depersonalizes/derealizes. It starts with visible agitation and anxiety, which quickly progresses to becoming argumentative and aggressive and eventually be completely unable to listen to logic or follow any train of thought, mine or his. I spent years trying to talk things over or find any way to pacify him in those moments, but I generally found that once I realized what was happening, he was too far gone and too far into victim mode, and any words that came out of my mouth would just end up getting twisted and make things worse. \n\nOf course, one of his big triggers is abandonment issues, so as soon as I start to realize that he\u2019s in that place and try to extricate myself from the situation, it tends to escalate things. My latest \u201csolution\u201d has been to just freeze and go comatose while he rages at me and calls me an asshole for ignoring his pain, and wait for him to get some sleep. It almost always happens late at night when he\u2019s overtired, and the only reset button tends to be sleep. Yes, sometimes this is made worse by alcohol but it\u2019s also been known to happen when he\u2019s dead sober. When he wakes up in the morning he can usually barely remember what has happened, is absolutely horrified at the way he\u2019s made me feel, and completely wracked with guilt.

He has ptsd and agoraphobia, mostly untreated for the majority of our time together. I finally convinced him to get some counseling maybe 6 months ago, and now he talks to a nice woman in the phone once a week, who seems helpful, and he has made some great strides recently in getting out more.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a large pile of issues between the agoraphobia and the ptsd, but what I\u2019m curious about today is the personality shift that tends to happen when he gets triggered and depersonalizes/derealizes. It starts with visible agitation and anxiety, which quickly progresses to becoming argumentative and aggressive and eventually be completely unable to listen to logic or follow any train of thought, mine or his. I spent years trying to talk things over or find any way to pacify him in those moments, but I generally found that once I realized what was happening, he was too far gone and too far into victim mode, and any words that came out of my mouth would just end up getting twisted and make things worse. \n\nOf course, one of his big triggers is abandonment issues, so as soon as I start to realize that he\u2019s in that place and try to extricate myself from the situation, it tends to escalate things. My latest \u201csolution\u201d has been to just freeze and go comatose while he rages at me and calls me an asshole for ignoring his pain, and wait for him to get some sleep. It almost always happens late at night when he\u2019s overtired, and the only reset button tends to be sleep.
