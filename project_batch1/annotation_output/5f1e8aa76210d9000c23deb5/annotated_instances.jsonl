{"id": "2452_counseling", "displayed_text": "Hi Louisiana, You got it right...he's \"supposed to be\" your father. It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. I don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I don't know if he's evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest.\u00a0A good therapist can support you in these goals. I wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult. :)", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 68, "end": 250, "span": "It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you.", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 52s "}}

I was a college student never seen a gun before. But there was about 10 police units and one army truck at 645am .They bust in my apt w big long guns w red scope and point at my face they roughed me up and pushed me against wall w gun to my head nothing was in my apt and charged they had against me were dropped i had guns pointed at me as I walked outside I went thru hell w this situation for about almost a year until I got it resolved and it ruined a lot of aspects from my life at the time. After it happened I was having nightmares of police and swat teams coming in my house it would be dreams where the doorbell would ring and I would look outside and see police cars surrounding my house and dream would end.. I wake up sweating and in extreme fear.. I\u2019m reminded of this when I see police officers in public now and everything comes back.. A level of anxiety and overall fear has been added to my life after this experience and I thought it would go away after awhile but it hasn\u2019t.. i was wondering to you all if this sounds like PTSD? And should I talk to someone \n\nThanks ", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 19, "end": 636, "span": "About a year and a half ago I had a traumatic experience involving a law enforcement no knock raid on my apt in college.
