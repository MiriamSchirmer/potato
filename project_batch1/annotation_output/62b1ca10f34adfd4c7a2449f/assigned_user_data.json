Hi everyone,\n\nI've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. \n\nI developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all.

Hi everyone,\n\nI've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. \n\nI developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The World was a Different Place.** \n\n*A demon laughed* \n\n*at me while I* \n\n*begged my Father not to fire.*\n\n*The lights were off.*\n\n*Alone in the dark,*\n\n*I battled the night.*\n\n*The world was a Different place there.* \n\n*The womb of reality burst*\n\n*when the gun fired and an*\n\n*ungodly scream*\n\n*came through me*\n\n*and my Father swayed,*\n\n*a tortured tranquility in him*\n\n*before he fell to the ground.*\n\n*The pitch black pistol*\n\n*falling into the chair beside his body,*\n\n*aimed down to the hell*\n\n*that possessed him.*\n\n*The world was a Different place there.*\n\n*Grabbing the gun,*\n\n*sliding it to the other room,*\n\n*screaming for help.*\n\n*All in seconds,*\n\n*desperately racing to beat the clock*\n\n*of my Father\u2019s mortal life.*\n\n*The world was a Different place there.*\n\n*The memory fades*\n\n*Blood leaked across the floor*\n\n*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*\n\n*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* \n\n*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m here.

I am in a healthy and stable relationship. Until tonight I felt like I was finally moving on with my life. \n\nToday, I took a big step and decided to go back to school and take one class.

", "displayed_text": "Rough night after college orientation NSFW \n\nI need to vent to someone who understands. \n\nI have C-PTSD from prolonged childhood trauma. It\u2019s been a terrible struggle to keep my shit together and live as normal of a life as I can.  Several years ago I attempted to go to school to get my degree. \n\nThere, I was raped and beat up at a party. This triggered a downward spiral that led to a suicide attempt that got me kicked out of school. I lost my job, my relationship and ended up homeless for a while. I was a wreck and unable to keep even a simple restaurant job. \n\nI\u2019ve spent the last few years clawing my way out of this pit. I forced myself to get through a shitty retail job even if it meant vomiting and crying every day before work. It was fucking hell. I only made it due to the kindness of some wonderful people. Sheer gratitude that someone cared enough to try to help me gave me what I needed to make it. \n\nToday, I have a career I am proud of. I am almost entirely out of debt. I am in a healthy and stable relationship. Until tonight I felt like I was finally moving on with my life. \n\nToday, I took a big step and decided to go back to school and take one class.
