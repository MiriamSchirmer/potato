Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. \n\nI developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all.

I thought that sex was just a requirement of love. I didnt realize I had been manipulated for months. Thankfully my parents came home early that day and caught him, otherwise I might not have ever realized what he did was wrong. I was 14, he was 19. He tricked me in so many ways. Made me feel special, convinced me I was his one and only. He used the fact that I had recently developed mental issues and wormed his way into my fragile state. He got me pregnant. He never knew, because I miscarried before the court date 3 months later. It was my first time having sex, my first time being pregnant, and my first miscarriage. At 14. I am now 21. I still have nightmares. I still can barely have sex without flashbacks. I still cringe every time I see his name. I still wince every time I see or hear someone that reminds me. And I still panic every year on that day. \nThe worst part? Its not even the flashbacks anymore. Its the baby fever I get that reminds me of the baby I lost. Its the tear I wipe away every time I see my nephew or niece, the moments of sadness when I pass the baby isles in walmart.

So anyway we are at this cafe and just catching up and half way through the conversation he starts talking about the reason he stopped teaching music was because he was kicked out because one of his students (16yo) had accused him of having sex with her and he had housed her for many nights in a house with only 30yo men because she had been kicked out and that he took her to his house late at night and she just stayed there. So he got kicked out and his girlfriend left him.

I wanted to share here because this sub looked so supportive and because something has been plaguing me for a while. I just decided to make a new account since I couldn't hold this in any longer.  \nTrigger warning for some; child sexual abuse, crude jokes  \nI recently went through an involuntary hospitalization (related to perceived suicidal ideation) and some of my typical behaviours and quirks caused a psychologist to take me aside and ask if I potentially had PTSD. I assumed she wanted this information to diagnose me or put it on my precautions sheet\\*. While curious, I prompted her to share why she thought so, and she replied with, \"I noticed you've been very startled at loud noises throughout the day. At times, you would stare into space and that concerned me.\" Now, I was curious. Although I had a fair share of PTSD-knowledge, I mostly comforted myself with the fact that a lot of them are veterans and just...nullified the possibility of me having it.   \nNow, the quirks I demonstrated were, as aforementioned, me jumping at loud noises and loud voices, being sensitive to touch, and also a strange blanking out. I don't remember what one would call it, but it strikes me as a whelming of thoughts about my \"trauma\" (which I'll explain below) and I can't help it when I'm in it. I feel like I'm there, but I don't hallucinate about it. It's just all the feelings of it, and it feels *terrible* when I have these spouts.

To put it short, I was raped by two guys (one over the age of consent, and the other almost there) at the age of 11. When I was 13, I was molested by an uncle. I'm 16 now. I've just been trying to deal with it by...joking. That's the only coping mechanism I have. I, at times, even joke about my trauma. Once, I joked about how I \"need to keep my grades up, otherwise, I'd just be a sex doll.\" It hurts, though. I can't stop thinking about how the incident was and sometimes I'm a ball of tears because of it.   \nSo, what do you guys think? Should I just get over it, or do I have PTSD?

Several years ago I attempted to go to school to get my degree. \n\nThere, I was raped and beat up at a party.

It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend \"Jay's\" house.

Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. \n\n\n\nI knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. \n\n\nEarlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a \"shooting in the woods\" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. \n\nAnd then this happened.\n\nI'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.\n\nI don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1558, "end": 2046, "span": "Back when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up.
