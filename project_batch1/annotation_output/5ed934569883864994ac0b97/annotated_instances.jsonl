The thought just popped into my head, and I've got to get back to work so I wanted to ask while it's on my mind.\n\nMy previous job had me on call 24/7 for a little over 3 years. It was in the medical field, and if a patient or nurse called me any time, day or night, I had to respond to the call. I would work my 9+ regular hours at the office or in the field, and then several more hours a day after hours on call, not to mention every weekend.. It was a good job, but I absolutely hated that part of it. It caused me to lose a lot of friends and put a lot of hardship between me and my family because I was ALWAYS at work.\n\nAnyway, about 2 months ago I decided that I needed to leave that job for my own mental well-being. I should note that I had always kept the standard AT&amp;T ringtone on my phone. After my last day, I changed my phone number, ringtone, etc. I needed to be free. Since leaving, I have noticed that almost everyone has that ringtone. When I'm out shopping or at a restaurant and someone's phone rings with that ringtone, an almost overwhelming amount of anxiety washes over me to the point that I almost feel sick at my stomach.

I feel like i cant talk about my trauma, because i don't even know if it actually happened, or if my mind just made it up.\n\nI've had a ridiculously high sex drive since late middle school for seemingly no reason, i was obsessed and so lost in fantasies (nothing immoral) that my grades fell. Im trans and poly, like so aggressively poly i have trouble with monogamous relationships. I have diagnosed chemical depression and general anxiety disorders but i thought it was common, especially in high school. I went to therapy but they would always try to figure out \"the real reason\" i was depressed, as though my litte sister passing wasn't enough. I attempted suicide several times, but nobody knew.\n\nI had a sexual relationship with an ex my sophomore year. A few months after we started having sex, i started dissociating and having flashbacks of things i didn't remember, followed by panic attacks. I had had lots of negative sexual encounters (like regret or harassment; i often got my ass slapped in middle school hallways and thought it was a good thing until i was older) which, sadly, lots of afab people do, but i didn't remember any assault. \n\nI still have the flashbacks, though not as often or aggressively. Some positions or certain phrases trigger it, sometimes it's just the act, sometimes it's because someone angrily kicked their backpack in the hall or raised their voice. I usually have to stop whatever sexual thing I'm doing and often don't do anything else sex-wise for several days, but i can occasionally force it out of my head and continue. I still have an elevated sex drive but not as crazy as before i started getting them. I still have problems with monogamy.\n\nI wonder if the sex drive and my being trans and poly were defense mechanisms, like subconsciously trying to retake control of my body. I guess I'll never really know. I've tried to tell therapists and counselors, but i can't ever spit it out because i feel like they'll tell me repressed memories are a myth or I'm doing it for attention and i just don't know what to do.

I\u2019m new to this sub reddit.\n\n\nI\u2019m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. \nI totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn\u2019t do anything. \nI had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn\u2019t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don\u2019t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.\nI\u2019m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can\u2019t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can\u2019t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. \nI also watched the worst accident I\u2019ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I\u2019d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn\u2019t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn\u2019t ok to drive. \nSo.. yea. I don\u2019t really know where I was going with this, I guess I\u2019m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they\u2019re doing better now. \nI don\u2019t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can\u2019t even do those things.\nI\u2019m trying so hard. I just feel like it\u2019s pointless sometimes. \n\nAnyway if you read this super long post..\nThank you.

{"id": "1046_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Finally getting help I had some childhood trauma.  And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   \n\nI injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  \n\nWell the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  \n\nLuckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. \n\nI looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) \n\n When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  \n\nI went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a \"cookie cutter\" plan.\n\nThey explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. \n\nAfter going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  \n\nThey truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  \n\nThey also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    \n\nWith their help I have been clean 3.5 months.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. \n\nSo today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.\n\nFor the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future....
