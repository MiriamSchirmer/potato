Or I can\u2019t make more than a certain amount a month. Am I wrong? Is this the way it is? Please tell me I am wrong. I can still work my $75,000 a year job now.

Over the last couple of weeks, fireworks have been going off all over my part of town. Often, the people who are doing it set them off late at night 1 or 2 am.  My PTSD, after an incident with people throwing fireworks and a near riot, is triggered by fireworks, bright lights, loud sounds and people in a confined space. I have for the last two years kept this under wraps with a few problems along the way like zoning out or feeling rising panic in some situations, as well as some sensor issues.  \n\n\nEither way, back to the fireworks in my town. With the fireworks at night, I have found that if I start my bed rutin again or get a specific fluffy blanket I can usually calm and soothe myself to sleep.  However a few days ago, just before New Year's eve as I was walking from the bus station after dropping my friends off, I noticed some kids running towards me. Thinking they were running to the bus I sidestepped out the way and kept going. Then it happened, I was close to coming round the corner and then \"bang\". A big flash of red light and sparks flew from around the corner. My first reaction was to stand still and as the last kid past me, I struggled not to grab onto him. My next reaction was to feel like crying. Which after a brief feeling of outer bodyness turned into a need for a smoke. I recently, and frustratingly, bought a packet of cigarets due to the bangs and the stress they were causing me. After that I then got back did the washing and tried to call the police non-emergency line to no avail, gave up and drank some whiskey. This obviously was a bad idea and just made me feel even worse. The follow on from that was to clean like a maniac.  \n\n\nRoll on new year's eve and fireworks are everywhere, people on squares and roadsides. I was with my friend so it was a little better. At our party it seemed to miss a lot of the fireworks, We saw the new year in and crashed.  The day after new year's day, everything came crashing down. My reaction to stress was to just sleep and after I tried to get some work done I just broke down and smoked all my cigarettes. The stress and isolation this brought just hit me with a large hammer. Why was it like this? Who could I contact?. I tried contacting one of my friends and gave up. Then a feeling of needing to get out of this came about me and I got scared. I knew I had alcohol at home and that was a risk.

When I was freshly 16, I was raped during a party in a small apartment, with the door open, and nobody helped me. I began acting out and getting in a lot of trouble after this, ultimately landing myself in acute inpatient for suicidal thoughts. I wrote my parents a letter telling them what happened to me, and social workers had to come in the hospital and report it with me. They never, ever contacted me or my parents EVER again. That alone is its own damage. \n2 years later, freshly 18 now, I began working as a houseman in a hotel. This means I cleaned everything except for inside the actual rooms. Well, there was a man that would stay Monday-Thursday for his construction job. He took an interest in me quickly, asking my age, where I go to school, then progressing into telling me I have \u201cbeautiful bedroom eyes\u201d and \u201cpure ness in my smile\u201d I knew he was up to something. He then began asking me which car is mine, when do I get off work, will my parents be waiting on me to come home from work tonight, etc. I began to be paranoid even when I left work, getting trapped in moments of my 16 year old self, thinking nobody cares what would happen to me, because after all, the police don\u2019t care about me.  At one point he entered the lady\u2019s restroom where I was cleaning, had me in a corner, touched my arm and asked how I like the new job. :( \nOne day, and this is so hard for me to tell because it became a repressed memory until my second hospitalization in October 2019, I was vacuuming the second floor hallway. Humming to myself probably, at the very start of this floor, the door to my left opened quickly. An arm, with orange hair and freckles, oh my god this is it, an arm grabs me. It was the man. He held me just inside the room, my left foot in the doorway. He told me to look in his eyes, gripped my arm tighter, and held me there. I was thinking to myself that this is it, he has me. He could\u2019ve done whatever he wanted. It felt like my eyes were looking into his for years, and his eyes, they were like... glass. Empty, yet fiery.  My mind made me see myself, naked, beaten, raped, and left all alone in the woods to rot. He let me go and I finished my shift.

I completely fell to the ground, it felt like I swallowed a rock. \nLong story, but my entire 2018 consisted of horrible paranoid thoughts and migraines, but I had forgotten this incident for a long time, so my therapist and I had a hard time getting it under control. Now that I remember, my life is bad. I have also borderline personality disorder that causes me MUCH distress on a daily basis, but now I\u2019m miserable.

{"id": "2036_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Could I have PTSD? Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.\n\nSo after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.\n\nAs I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.\n\n\nSo here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:\n\nSome years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.\n\nAll this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.\n\nThen after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.\n\nSome time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.\n\nBefore all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.\n\nNow after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. \n\nSo my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1302, "end": 3613, "span": "We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat.
