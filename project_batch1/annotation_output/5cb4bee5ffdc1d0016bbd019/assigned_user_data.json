Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.\n\nSo after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.\n\nAs I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.\n\n\nSo here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:\n\nSome years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.\n\nAll this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.\n\nThen after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.\n\nSome time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.\n\nBefore all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.\n\nNow after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. \n\nSo my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?\n", "displayed_text": "Could I have PTSD?

I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week. It might be a long shot that anyone has experience with this. Regardless, can anyone give me some help/advice/reassurance? I'm not sure what to do.

Over the last couple of weeks, fireworks have been going off all over my part of town. Often, the people who are doing it set them off late at night 1 or 2 am.  My PTSD, after an incident with people throwing fireworks and a near riot, is triggered by fireworks, bright lights, loud sounds and people in a confined space.

With the fireworks at night, I have found that if I start my bed rutin again or get a specific fluffy blanket I can usually calm and soothe myself to sleep.  However a few days ago, just before New Year's eve as I was walking from the bus station after dropping my friends off, I noticed some kids running towards me. Thinking they were running to the bus I sidestepped out the way and kept going. Then it happened, I was close to coming round the corner and then \"bang\". A big flash of red light and sparks flew from around the corner. My first reaction was to stand still and as the last kid past me, I struggled not to grab onto him. My next reaction was to feel like crying. Which after a brief feeling of outer bodyness turned into a need for a smoke. I recently, and frustratingly, bought a packet of cigarets due to the bangs and the stress they were causing me. After that I then got back did the washing and tried to call the police non-emergency line to no avail, gave up and drank some whiskey. This obviously was a bad idea and just made me feel even worse.
