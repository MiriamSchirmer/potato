{"id": "636_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I'm (F20) really bad at this whole \"coping\" thing Hi. I'm new to this subreddit, so I hope I dont violate the rules with this.\n\nI've had PTSD for a while. I was assaulted as a child, by my cousin, then again at 11 by my boyfriendwho was 16, and again at 14 by a different boyfriend. I never told anyone, even my therapists, I was \"normal\" in my eyes, because until two years ago some of the incidents never resonated as an assault. I was conditioned to think they were normal things that teen girls do with or for the older men in their lives. My therapist knew though, I think. They're trained to know, especially when a young kid is edging around certain subjects like their love life or past boyfriends.\n\nWell, a friend who knew me and my first boyfriend (the one who assaulted me at 11), has recently started hanging out with him again after years of no connection. He's apparently VERY different now, but she doesn't know that he assaulted me. She keeps pressuring me into going to their friend's house to hang out, she keeps texting me funny things he's said to her, and I woke up early this morning read a text from her about him and fell back asleep because it was early. \n\nI had a TERRIBLE nightmare, I woke up and didnt even remember where I was. I won't go into details, but it SEVERELY affected me. I dont know what I want to do, I want to run away and stay put. I want to cry and I want to brush it off. I dont know what to do, because i never played into the PTSD. I didnt want my siblings or parents to know, i didnt want anyone to know. I never told anyone about that diagnosis and now? I wish i had.\n\nThis same friend also dated the other boyfriend who assaulted and stalked me (for four years, as a minor, he was an adult). I'm open about the stalking, I told her when she asked me, but I never told her about the assault. We worked together and he would wait for her (she worked in the back mostly, I worked in the front of the restaurant), but he always watched me. Always did things to make me jump, like leaving so I'd be comfortable and wait for me to relax, then he'd reappear. \n\nI was fine until I wasn't, and it feels like today was a breaking point. I feel scared and angry. And like no one will understand. 'Why didnt I speak up before?' 'Why didnt I tell anyone?' And I'm just scared. I dont even want a hug, or someone to hold my hand, I dont want anything. I just went to my room instead of taking a hike like I wanted and started hyperventilating, I cried. Like I never have before. \n\nSorry if this doesn't make sense. I can't find anywhere else to put it. I just wanna throw up and hide. Am I overreacting? Is this all in my head?\n\nAnyways, best wishes all, stay safe and occupied during this stressful time.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2169, "end": 2286, "span": "a breaking point.
