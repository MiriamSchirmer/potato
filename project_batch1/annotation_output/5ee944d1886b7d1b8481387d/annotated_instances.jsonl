When I turned 13  I moved in with my sexist father.\n\nFast forward 2 years, I met my now ex of 4 years. I lost my virginity to him, however, he turned out to be very abusive 8 months into the relationship.  He raped me, beat me, and verbally abused me. Took 4 years to really get out of that toxic relationship.\n\nShortly after the break up  I was raped by someone I thought I was becoming friends with. BUT then again... what did I know about making friends. I was an outcast and had no friends growing up and my ex wouldn't let me have friends. Anyways this person stalked me and threatened me after. I quit my job and moved shortly after not too far but where he didn't know I lived.\n\n\nIn between and after all this... quite a few men has looked at me or/and treated me like some sort of toy for their pleasure. \n\nI'm so emotionally broken. I don't know what to do with myself sometimes. Since then I've met an amazing person who treats me right ... but I don't know if I really want to be with this person. I've made friends that don't hurt me and seem to care. \n\nBut I have no one I can really talk to about all this. I mean they know the gist. But I'm that \"happy friend\"-- you know the one that is never sad or cries, the one who listens and is always smiling. Keeping those happy, positive vibes.\n\nDeep down though ... I'm sad. I struggle with a lot of anxiety and depression. I have PTSD and try so hard to push through each and every day. Some days It feels easier than others. Most days I can't focus on anything and am completely overwhelmed with my memories, thoughts, emotions. \n\nI don't feel like anyone around me truely understands what a toll all this has taken on me and how much it actually hurts me. To them it seems like because it is in the past I should be just fine and dandy now (like out of sight - out of mind type thing) or they simply have nothing helpful to say. \n\nI can't really blame them for not understanding. But I'm just going through it right now.

Hi, i'm Uncomfy and i'm new to Reddit. I made this account because specific people in my life say that i have too many issues and i'm uncomfortable to be around. So i made this account specifically for asking questions about things that relate to mental health, and occasionally things i like to indulge in to keep myself preoccupied from the outside world. Hopefully this will cause my issue of being an uncomfortable person.Before i start i must specify that i am not making anything i say up or am doing this for attention. I have no idea how Reddit works, so i apologize if i don't do things that people may find mandatory. (I would appreciate They/them pronouns if you end up responding to this post please.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it.

We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. \nI was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn\u2019t feel like I was getting better. \nI was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn\u2019t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. \nI saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I\u2019m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. \nI\u2019ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. \nMy medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. \nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can\u2019t handle my grief, I can\u2019t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It\u2019s absolutely horrible. \nI\u2019m a hairdresser and I\u2019ll have clients say certain words to me like \u201chang\u201d \u201ccloset\u201d \u201cdied/death\u201d \u201cbrother\u201d or make jokes about suicide even though it\u2019s completely out of context I\u2019ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It\u2019s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don\u2019t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. \nI hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can\u2019t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. \nIt is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I\u2019m not ready to explain to the people around me what I\u2019m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. \nIt\u2019s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don\u2019t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. \n\nI can\u2019t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I\u2019m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn\u2019t like me. Advance on getting over that fear would be so appreciated because I KNOW I need some serious therapy right now and my family tells me all the time. Does anyone have any good skills in these areas? Please help me. I\u2019m suffering and I know damn well I can\u2019t go through the rest of my life like this. \n\nTLDR \u2014 My baby brother committed suicide last year, and I ended up developing PTSD from it; I have been having extreme flashbacks and my therapist stopped treating me due to my diagnosis. I really need advice on coping skills for flashbacks &amp; how to be vulnerable to another professional.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 49, "end": 138, "span": "I\u2019m 23 years old, and last year in April my 15 year old brother hung himself in his close", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 24s "}}
