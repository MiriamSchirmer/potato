This showed me again what an idiot I am. But I need to get this off my chest before I do anything further. Now here we go again, what brings me close to suicide:\nAround 2 months ago my girlfriend I was together with for like half a year broke up with me. But it wasn't the \"cool way\". I caught her cheating, and then she broke up with me. I told her if she is sorry and wont do it again we can still be together and that I really love her and would forgive her. That time I was so attached to her, I dont understand it anymore today but thats how things used to be. She just refused and left. Out of nothing... I suffer from PTSD and paranoia, she was there for me in my baddest times. I was dumb for even staying with her. She was never serious, a total fraud. I dont know why she even stayed with me one second... It took me some time and I'm not done processing it yet, but it gets better. Back then I also had an reddit account and gained a lot of support and help which I'm very thankful for. Smoking weed also helps me a lot. It helps me calm down, I'm full with high tense energy all the time and its hard for me to get clear thoughts and I'm very shaky. I usually get the weed from a \"friend\" who was out of town for 3 weeks. The PTSD got worse, and I know weed would be my savior. Without searching for it I found a profile on twitter, yes twitter, from a guy I've known for a long time, not actually in real life but have seen his profile couple of times. It was his personal page where he has real life stuff etc and makes let's plays. And he had a post where he said he is selling weed, you just needed to dm him. The dumb addict I am I would give it a try. I would never buy it that way usually, but I was in a dark hole and didnt had anything on me and my dealer wasnt available ,so I thought okay this guy seems cool whatever cant be that bad and I mean its just weed not heroin or meth. A virtual friend showed me his profile some time ago so he must be cool. I wrote him a dm. He answered pretty fast and I bought weed worth 50$ from him. I let him convince me to pay with a amazon gift card. I'm an idiot I know. But my post traumatic stress was so bad I just said fuck it, he has a lot of real life stuff on his page why would he scam someone over 50$? So I paid, send him the code and gave him my adress. All of that with my REAL LIFE twitter account I wasnt even active anymore at that time but still had a lot of old posts. Couple days later a friend of mine offered me to go watch a movie, I refused and stayed home just to receive my package. It never came and I wasted much time waiting for it... After I didnt receive it after 1 week I asked him a couple of times what happened still fully in trust and believing he was legit. After asking and asking over and over he finally blocked me and I realized I got scammed. I did some research on him and found out he was scamming people on the regular. Sometimes even doxing them, threatening them and stuff like that, when they wanted to go to the police. dont know if you can even call this a person, he is a monster in my opinion.  he also is into cyber bullying. His followers/friends are terrorizing people online. it seems like they do it just for fun Or because their lifes are bad they thing they need to make others bad as well.... I was shocked I couldnt believe what I got myself into. This person has my adress, knows how I look, knows a lot probably since I contacted him with my main twitter. I dont want to and cant go to the police because then I will get fucked for \"buying\" weed. I could seriously lose my job here. I wish so bad I could go back in time... I dont know what that guy is going to do with my infos, but I know I'm in real trouble. I know there is no reason but if he wanted to he could fuck my life up. Just because I was stupid, didnt pay enough attention for one single moment. I felt so bad  I needed the weed, but all for what? I fucking have paranoia but still trusted him. I feel worthless. I just didnt wanted any problems. I was always nice to everybody. Helped others. Went to the shop buying 50$ worth of amazon without even questioning it. I dont wanted to get PTSD, I didnt ask for it. I didnt want to get a whore as a girlfriend who leaves me back in the dirt. Tbh atm I dont even want to life anymore. As if thats not enough I'm also now wasting peoples time on reddit with this long ass Text.When I think of this bastard having a good time with the money I had to work hard for I'm so full of hate. if they or he would read this he'd probably laugh at me for being a pussy and crying on reddit for help. Wants to see me suffer or whatsoever... My reaction seems a bit harsh, I know, but it's really boiling over right now.

Example: see a career counselor to determine my ideal career, go back to school/get a certification, network with others in my desired industryWhat thoughts, feelings, or urges might get in my way? Example: thoughts of \"What if I fail? I'm not smart enough. I can't do it. I'm too busy to put energy into this.\" Feelings of fear, shame, excitement. Urges to distract myself through drinking or watch tv instead of taking action.It would be helpful to remind myself that: example: It is natural to have these thoughts, feelings, and urges but I can take action anyway. I deserve to have a fulfilling life.The smallest and easiest step I can take now: example: research career counselors in my area and write down their phone numbersThe time, day and date that I will take that first step, is: example: Tonight at 7pm\u00a0At least think through these answers but it is most beneficial to write them down.

What kind of relationships would you have?I imagine your fear has kept you from achieving those goals because your mind tells you you can't do it until the fear is gone. I challenge you to do the following exercise:What is a goal you would like to achieve? Example: I would like to change careersWhat actions are necessary to complete this goal? Example: see a career counselor to determine my ideal career, go back to school/get a certification, network with others in my desired industryWhat thoughts, feelings, or urges might get in my way? Example: thoughts of \"What if I fail? I'm not smart enough. I can't do it. I'm too busy to put energy into this.\" Feelings of fear, shame, excitement. Urges to distract myself through drinking or watch tv instead of taking action.It would be helpful to remind myself that: example: It is natural to have these thoughts, feelings, and urges but I can take action anyway. I deserve to have a fulfilling life.The smallest and easiest step I can take now: example: research career counselors in my area and write down their phone numbersThe time, day and date that I will take that first step, is: example: Tonight at 7pm\u00a0At least think through these answers but it is most beneficial to write them down.

You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it.

Hi, i'm Uncomfy and i'm new to Reddit. I made this account because specific people in my life say that i have too many issues and i'm uncomfortable to be around. So i made this account specifically for asking questions about things that relate to mental health, and occasionally things i like to indulge in to keep myself preoccupied from the outside world. Hopefully this will cause my issue of being an uncomfortable person.Before i start i must specify that i am not making anything i say up or am doing this for attention.
