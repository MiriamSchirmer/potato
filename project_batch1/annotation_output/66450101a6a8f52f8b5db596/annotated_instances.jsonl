I was assaulted as a child, by my cousin, then again at 11 by my boyfriendwho was 16, and again at 14 by a different boyfriend. I never told anyone, even my therapists, I was \"normal\" in my eyes, because until two years ago some of the incidents never resonated as an assault. I was conditioned to think they were normal things that teen girls do with or for the older men in their lives. My therapist knew though, I think. They're trained to know, especially when a young kid is edging around certain subjects like their love life or past boyfriends.\n\nWell, a friend who knew me and my first boyfriend (the one who assaulted me at 11), has recently started hanging out with him again after years of no connection. He's apparently VERY different now, but she doesn't know that he assaulted me. She keeps pressuring me into going to their friend's house to hang out, she keeps texting me funny things he's said to her, and I woke up early this morning read a text from her about him and fell back asleep because it was early. \n\nI had a TERRIBLE nightmare, I woke up and didnt even remember where I was. I won't go into details, but it SEVERELY affected me. I dont know what I want to do, I want to run away and stay put. I want to cry and I want to brush it off. I dont know what to do, because i never played into the PTSD. I didnt want my siblings or parents to know, i didnt want anyone to know. I never told anyone about that diagnosis and now?

I'm open about the stalking, I told her when she asked me, but I never told her about the assault.

{"id": "920_ptsd", "displayed_text": "sometimes I wish I was raped Now before you start typing about how I shouldn't say that and I could never want something like that to happen to me, I want you to hear me out.\n\nWhen I was little. about 6 or 7ish, something happened to me. And ever since then I still don't know if I can call it sexual assault, sexual abuse, or just a bad experience. There are several reasons I don't know what to call it. I was young but so was he. He was four hears older but I know that he knew what he was doing. But at the same time he only would have been 10 or 11 at the time. I never said no, I never said stop, and when I told him he was heavy or that something hurt or was going too far he stopped. But yet again, I was only 6 or 7 and I just thought if felt good. I remember him telling me not to tell my mom or dad, and it happened more than once. I enjoyed it at the time though, It felt good. No intercourse actually happened, but there was a lot of grinding and touching. He had me watch him \"do his thing\" and asked if I would do it too and when I said no he didn't make me.\n\nThe thing is though, I still see this person all of the time and I will for the rest of my life probably. We have never talked about it, but I don't even know if he'd remember it. This person has always been violent and has a history of abusing my parents and me physically, along with \"anger management\" classes when he was about 10 or 13, I don't really remember. That's another thing. I don't really remember all that happened, it was over ten years ago. I remember some of it but not all of it.\n\nNow this is why I wish I had been raped. When I was in the fifth grade I started self harming. Not cutting, I hadn't even heard of that. Instead I would dig my nails into my skin and scratch until I bleed, this happened whenever I thought about what happened because I thought I did something wrong. After I told my friend (Who I'm still extremely close with to this day) about it I kind of just forgot about it every few months until when I started to hit puberty and feel sexual about anything. This was about seventh grade. I had just learned what rape was and then I remembered what happened to me and I wrote it down in my diary. The nexy day I blacked it all out with a marker.\n\nIn eighth grade I had a male teacher for homeroom who taught many of my classes. I would feel constant anxiety when he walked around the room because even the thought of him coming behind me scared me so much I was shaking. Now the weird part was he was my favorite teacher and at the time my favorite adult. So sometimes I would stay up from lunch and talk to him about anxiety and such. But at the same time, I was scared out of my mind that he was going to do something to me. Now keep in mind, this was the most innocent, sweetest teacher, nicest adult and teacher I knew at the time, and yes he was a history teacher, fulfilling the stereotype. But Even though I trusted him more than pretty much anyone at the time, I still was in a constant state of fear when he walked around the room. I thought putting myself in uncomfortable situations like seeing him during lunch would help me to trust him more and it actually did. Things got better, even though I never did tell him what had happened when I was little. in eighth grade a started to scratch myself more and a few of my friends noticed. It was on and off but by then end of the year I had stopped.\n\nWhen high school started I was a nervous wreck. I was starting a new school where I didn't know anybody. So obviously, little old me began to think that the first friend I made there would be my best friends, so I told a lot of people. By a lot I mean like 7 or 8. Some of them I still talk to, but a lot of them I told because they themselves had been assaulted. So early into freshman year I had my first kiss, which led to my first make out session. Of course I freak out because there's this heavy weight on top of me and I hadn't control anything. My heart started to race and I had a hard time breathing. I was having an anxiety attack. That's when I started cutting. All of freshman year I was cutting on and off. Nowhere anyone could see though. The next few months things got better and worse all the time. One week I'd be fine and the next I'd be scared to go home because the person that did that to me would be back there. About February I had my first boyfriend. I told him about it and whenever I would start freaking out when we were doing something he would be totoally okay with it and just make sure I was okay. Truly a great guy. We broke up after about 9 months. I didn't have a lot of trouble with him sexually but when I did it was bad. We never had sex though. To this day I am still a virgin.\n\nNow I'm a sophomore in high school and for the past few months as I've been pleasuring myself and such, I would start crying. It's not like any of the things I was doing to myself he had done to me, but I would constantly think of someone, him, another man, holding me against my will and raping me or forcing me to do things. What happened to me was not anywhere this close to extreme, and sometimes I feel like I just need to get over myself and deal with it because nothing really bad happened. But something did happen, and Sometimes I feel like it was my fault and I was in the wrong and I wasn't abused or anything and it was just kids being kids. But on the other hand I remember him knowing exactly what to do and how to make himself feel good.\n\nI know he took advantage of me. But cutting since fifth grade and being in a constant state of fear of my eighth grade history teacher doesn't add up from what he did. It's not like he forced me to do anything. I've read so many articles, I've contacted Planned Parenthood and RAINN chatrooms asking them if I'd even been abused. They all said that's up for me to decide. Maybe it wasn't the thing that happened to me though. Maybe it was the fact that he would hit my mom my dad and me and that put the fear into my head. I don't know what caused it but I feel like I'm overreacting but I just can't help the anxiety and the tears and the thought of some man inside of me whenever I touch myself. But it just doesn't add up.\n\nI do sometimes wish I was raped. It would make life clearer. It might cause more trauma but at least I would know it wasn't my fault. At least I would know it was assault or I would know it was abuse. at least I would have the courage to tell an adult and not have them judge me thinking that I was just some horny kid who messed around with a family member because I was such a horny child. I would know why I feel so exposed and preyed on. Because right now I have no idea why I feel this sort of... I don't even know if you can call it PTSD.\n\nI know people who have been raped will tell me to never wish this upon myself but I really do. It might make my life harder, but I won't have to question everything I do and think to myself that I'm an attention seeker even when I never told anybody some of this information.

Our relationship has progressed and one night I was really having an awful night. \n\nCouldn\u2019t sleep and I had some really bad flashback like nightmares. He called me and we chatted on the phone for a bit. After talking and me apologizing for talking about stuff. I said \u201cI don\u2019t get why it effects me. It\u2019s not like I was abused. I wasn\u2019t traumatized\u201d and he said \u201cI think you were. You\u2019re having a trauma response and you deserve help. You deserve to be able to tell people. He hurt you really badly and you\u2019re allowed to not feel okay\u201d\n\nAnd then it all kinda clicked? I realized that I was badly hurt and by not telling my therapist, I was just helping my biodad win. \n\nI have a FaceTime appointment with my theorist tomorrow. I\u2019m mildly terrified. I\u2019m so scared that he\u2019s going to be mad at me. \n\nI marked this as NSFW. I don\u2019t wanna trigger anyone accidentally:) I know I don\u2019t have a diagnosis of PTSD and I don\u2019t wanna undermine your guy\u2019s trauma so lmk if this post isn\u2019t allowed :)", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 251, "end": 301, "span": "He is incredibly abusive.
