I was sexually solicited by a married man in my church, then he accused me of soliciting him.  I don't know how many people he told, but I was told I could no longer go to church (unless I went before 6 elders to confess 'my' sin.)  I feel ashamed already, but also, if I talk about what he did, then I get him in trouble also, so I don't quite get what to do there.  You guys, any ideas?  \n\nHe implied to me early on that he was suicidal, that I should keep the relationship secret, (I felt almost threatened),  I still felt horribly guilty, that I was going to go to hell, and I still feel that way, even though I try to trust in Jesus to forgive all my sins.  But I have yet to accuse him to anyone, it's like I am still protecting him, when I really would like my name back, etc.  \n\nI isolate myself in my small community.  I don't want to hurt his wife, or take his job away, or his family, or his reputation, even though he has taken my reputation for no reason, my name, and made me feel like garbage, and completely valueless.  Like I have no voice.  Like I do not matter. \n\nWhat would you do?  It's actually even more complicated, I'm just writing the bare outline here.  Every day, I make a decision to protect him, even though he has given me nothing but enduring and ongoing pain.  I don't want to see him hurt.  But at some point I deserve to have a life, and have my name cleared, at least half of it.  I don't want to treat him like he has treated me.  but doing nothing does not feel right either.  I don't want to be vengeful.  \n\nAny thoughts?  Two of my brothers even made me feel guiltier than I already did.  \"Gee, like next time I feel like shit, I'll just call you guys, (my brothers) because I know you'll make me feel worse, not be kind in my confession. \"  \n\nI was also doing informal counseling with this guy,  I had already had cPTSD from prior physical and sexual abuse in my life.  Thanks for your responses.  I am really interested in any practical or kind ideas, even for him.  Is there anything simple I could do, that would gently clear my name?  Or is it just going to get worse?  I also happen to know that there are leadership in that church who have had affairs, and done unethical business deals, cheating their partners.  Yet they go unscathed.  \n\nIt's a little late tonight, and it's Christmas Day tomorrow, so I might not check this real quickly, but I will eventually.  Thank you.  The emotional part of this is hard, I became attached to him, yet afraid of him and his helpers.  I may have to just become really objective about this, while doing what I can to respond kindly.

{"id": "2114_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Please help me figure out what's happening/Vent (TW - Suicide attempt mention, panic attack). I've been dealing with depression and generalized anxiety for over three years, so my life has been colourfully scattered with panic attacks and random depressive episodes. I worked really hard to ignore them and wait to seek treatment until I was an adult, as I was afraid that I was faking my symptoms and didn't have a problem because it was just \"teenager hormones\". I also have never been great at taking care of myself. When I entered college this year I was walking in, completely in denial about my issues and unprepared to take care of myself. \n\n\nIt took me only a week to have a melt down lmao. I had the worst panic attack of my life, I couldn't see and couldn't move and thought I was having a seizure. I quickly figured out that this wasn't working and sought a doctor who I later realized was not-great for treatment, who prescribed me Zoloft and Zopiclone, sleeping pills that I had previously had an addiction problem with. The Wednesday of my second week I immediately attempted suicide, had breakdowns every time I was left alone, downed pills like it was candy and was thankfully admitted to the hospital on Friday. There were so many fucking awful things I went through that week and I was out of control, and the suicide attempt scared the shit out of me. My therapist later told me the doctors theorized that my history of depression + my bad reaction to the Zoloft had led to my situation. I spent a week in a child psychiatric unit and dropped out of my college. There's so many other things I could talk about but this post is already long enough and that's not what this post is about.\n\n\nI'm terrified of what happened to me. I'm in a really great environment right now\u2014 I have an amazing support system, am able to stay in a lovely home with understanding parents who want the best for me. It's been almost two months now since the whole ordeal and I'm in recovery from my depression, seeing therapists and have a new doctor. I feel better. But I can't shake the experience and it keeps popping up.\n\n\nThe college I was at has offered me guaranteed admission into the winter semester, but I can't go back. When I returned to the college a couple days after I left the hospital I was fine, but I couldn't enter the bathroom I had a panic attack in. I was also roommates with a lifelong best friend of mine during this whole ordeal who I am no longer friends with because of how she dealt with everything. I can't stand the thought of going back to the college, the one I walked around in a drug-fuelled stupor and the one that contains an ex-childhood friend who dealt with my episode in the worst possible way. I'm also intensely afraid of going back to the way I used to be. I've never been one that's been afraid of the future, like going to college\u2014 these things have always excited me. But now things like school, work, living with roommates/independently; they scare the shit out of me. I have hazy memories of suffering from depression at night whilst pushing myself through shifts at work in the day or at school and I don't want to go through that again. I'm afraid to live with others and cause them problems again with my issues. Maybe I'm just being lazy, but the idea of going back to things like that stresses me out and has caused panic attacks. At the moment I am slated to get a job in the next week so I can work until January, then live with a friend in the city until summer, but the more I move closer to it the more I want to stay home until the next fall semester. I'm just scared of taking on responsibilities and putting myself through stress again, and letting others down. \n\n\nI was actually supposed to move in with a friend right away and went to live at her apartment for a trial week, and I wanted to leave after about three days and go home. I also slept in her bunk bed last Thursday night and woke up in the middle of the night, and thought for a moment I was back in my old college dorm (I slept in a bunk bed there too), remembered everything I went through and had a panic attack. \n\n\nOther mini-things like listening to old music I listened to, feeling anxiety/stress, having people ask me if I'm okay, deadlines etc. all are very likely to make me cry or get really pissed off and afraid. I constantly feel guilty asking things from anyone and I'm so vulnerable to stress that even the tiniest little things get me on edge and cause extreme reactions. I'm also having a big problem with memory since it is one of the side-effects of abusing Zopiclone; so much so that I barely remember my life before now and if I do I am not emotionally connected to them (I feel like a completely different person now, so doing stuff the \"old me\" does also makes me panic). \n\n\nSorry this is so long, I suppose this was sort of a vent as well, but I'm just really scared. I don't know if it's just a natural reaction to this sort of experience, it's PTSD, or it's just me being lazy? I'm saving this post so I can talk to my therapist about it but I just wanted the opinions of others. Is it possible to get PTSD from a suicide attempt/my experiences? Or does this just sound like a natural reaction, and if so\u2014 how long does this last?\n\n\nThe more things move the more I want them to slow down, and everyone in my life is trying their best to accommodate me so I feel bad asking them to do it even more. If I need to push through and do it, I want to try my best; but I don't want to push myself too hard and risk anything like this happening again.

{"id": "1561_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD from another\u2019s experience Trigger warning for sexual content, BDSM, similarities with pedophilia, mention of parental abuse, mention of suicide\n\nTo give a little background, I (23F) was abused my by dad for the first 6 years of my life, physically and verbally. A family member mentioned something about possible sexual abuse, but this topic is very avoided by our family, so it\u2019s never discussed. \n\nMy older brother (29) was seriously affected by the abuse he endured, and now has his own set of struggles and problems he faces as an adult. This includes uncontrollable anger, violence to his girlfriend, screaming, throwing things (anything from a mug to a dinner chair) around when things don\u2019t go his way, threatening suicide, and more. I lived with him and my mom for a few years like this and this caused me to be very sensitive to noise, particularly made by men. I don\u2019t live with them anymore. I have been afraid and wary of men for my whole life, and part of me wants to keep it that way for my safety even though I know it causes me a lot of pain in my every day of life.\n\nWithout getting too into details, my long distance girlfriend (22) visited a BDSM dungeon to learn what it was about and instantly had a 70 year old man infatuated with her. He invited her to his house to teach her, and I strongly discouraged her from going. After an impact play session at the dungeon and some time, she asked me if she could go to his house for more sessions because he wanted it so badly. We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. \n\nThis man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn\u2019t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He\u2019d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.\n\nOne of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend\u2019s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. \n\nHe continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me. I already had an extreme aversion to the idea of sex with men, especially old men, and I couldn\u2019t handle that. I messaged my girlfriend that night that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch any more of their sessions.\n\nSome time passed, she had one or two more sessions with him (I tried to think about it as little as possible while it was going on so I wasn\u2019t keeping count), and my girlfriend moved for school in early fall. After a while, I believed that he was in the past and wouldn\u2019t be a problem again. Eventually, my girlfriend and I discussed this and she realized how creepy this situation actually was, and she felt extremely uncomfortable with how familiar this old man was with her body. We agreed that we shouldn\u2019t have contact with him anymore and she told him this politely in a text. We tried to move on together and leave this in the past.\n\nAnd then he posted photos of her body on a BDSM website without her consent. She asked him to take it down, he refused. After a whole night of pleading him to take it down, we reported it and it disappeared. A couple days later, he posted it again. She got in contact with the dungeon she met him at, which he was actually longterm volunteer for, and they were able to get the photo down and promised my girlfriend they\u2019d keep an eye on his profile and that they\u2019d deal with his situation with the dungeon.\n\nTLDR: Creepy 70 year old man consistently pushes my girlfriend\u2019s and my boundaries during BDSM impact play session and then posts photos of my gf\u2019s body in retaliation of my gf telling him she doesn\u2019t want him in her life anymore.\n\nNow I have an extreme on-sight reaction to any old man even slightly similar to this man. I feel like I\u2019m going to collapse and cry and freak out the second I visually process an old man. The biggest problem is that I work at a drugstore and there are LOTS of old men who use the store. I\u2019m terrified of them and I don\u2019t know how long I can handle these extreme responses I have to seeing them. Nearly of my trauma related reactions have funneled into this and it\u2019s more extreme than anything I\u2019ve experienced before.\n\nThankfully, I will be started EMDR therapy soon, and I really really hope to see improvement one day. I think I might need to quit my job. I feel like I\u2019m going to die when I have to ring up an old man, I can barely speak to them and I can\u2019t look them in the eyes. I\u2019ve cried throughout typing this and I am so scared about going back to work every single day.\n\nDoes it make sense that my triggers and reactions changed so much just by this situation I didn\u2019t even experience firsthand?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 181, "end": 550, "span": "I (23F) was abused my by dad for the first 6 years of my life, physically and verbally.

{"id": "2569_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Traumatic experience (potential trigger warning) \\[Trigger warning: confrontation, potential abuse, self-harm\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to \"listen to her point of view because she had listened to me.\" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our \"conversation.\" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.\n\nAt some point in this \"conversation\" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say \"No\" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said \"nice talking to you guys.\" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.\n\nIn the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way \"there\".  \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways.

I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that \"traditional college experience.\" Truth is, I really hate it.

It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. \n\nMy other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the \"Traditional college experience\" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things.

It\u2019s kind of hard for me to find anyone to talk to besides my therapist about this, because I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same feelings as when someone goes through this and their loved one actually does pass. \n\nA brief summary of what happened: The day after Thanksgiving I ended up convincing my boyfriend to go to the urgent care for a pain in his side that he\u2019d been feeling for a few weeks but had gotten to the point where he was having pain with every breath he took. We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn\u2019t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He\u2019s not able to workout because he\u2019s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. \n\nI was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.\n\nI feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn\u2019t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he\u2019s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It\u2019s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...\n\nNot to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing. It\u2019s just so much to deal with all at once and I just feel so alone like no one else can understand what I\u2019m going through.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 690, "end": 876, "span": "We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn\u2019t come in he could have died within the next few days.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1500, "span": "Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me.

{"id": "2657_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Would you expose your childhood abuser? Recently I have come to terms with my flashbacks and repressed memories being real. It was a close family member. I was about 5 and he must have been around 9-10. The only thing I remember clearly is him holding me down in a bed and taking my trousers off, everything else is very blurry. Throughout the life he would also act very disturbing, but at this point I was old enough to tell him to stop being inappropriate. He was doing this like rubbing my thigh or trying to caress my breast. I don't know why I didn't connect the dots, my brain just wouldn't let me tbh. \nI have broken down badly now and I am using medication atm. But the worst thing ever for me is just a few months ago his second daughter was born. And I feel so scared. I don't want those baby girls to go through anything like that, I wish i could somehow warn his wife or another family member. I obvs have 0 proof and well I come from a post communist country, where you never ever talk about anything like this and your mental health is a no no. \nI feel bad for not warning anyone, but I feel like even if I did gain the courage to say something no one would believe me.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 124, "end": 610, "span": "It was a close family member.

{"id": "2068_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I was in a car accident and now I have this weird thing happening to me at intersections I\u2019m just posting this because I need to tell someone and I feel like no one really understands my ptsd and I actually don\u2019t exactly understand what\u2019s happening to me in specific situations, when sometimes stopped at a red light. \nI was in a car accident over a year ago where my car was t-boned at an intersection. I broke my pelvis in four places, a rib, and had a brain bleed. The most significant, long lasting affect of the accident is the ptsd I have now. I have road rage, and at almost every intersection I pass it\u2019s very scary for me and I often will cry out. I feel pathetic because I\u2019m 26 years old and even with friends in the car with me I\u2019ll cry out in fear uncontrollably. Most of the time in the car I\u2019m a little on edge but am fine, but when crossing intersections or if I feel another driver is acting recklessly near me I\u2019ll get very upset. \nI have this one very weird thing happen to me when I am sitting at a red light. It happens sometimes but yesterday was the most severe, as I happened to get stopped on a red light at the same intersection where the accident was, it\u2019s in a town over from where I live now and I avoid the area so I am not over there much.\nAnyways so when I am sitting at the red light, I start to feel very woozy, and I start to feel like I\u2019m leaving my body or losing control of my body. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m passing out or what exactly is happening but it\u2019s frightening and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll lose consciousness. I\u2019ll usually try to shake my head and kind of wake myself up or open a window, and by the time the light turns green and I can go again then it will pass and it will go away. Sometimes when I stop the car on red the episode will start where I feel like the car is still moving even though it\u2019s not and I\u2019ll press extra hard on the brake and realize I\u2019m not actually moving, then the sickness/pass out feeling starts. Does this happen to anyone else?
