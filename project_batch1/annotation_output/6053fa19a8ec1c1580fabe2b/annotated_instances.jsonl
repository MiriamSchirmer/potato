Background on me: PTSD diagnosed , childhood trauma, I don\u2019t remember a lot of my childhood and continue (as an adult) to go into black out mode when things get tough. I am a virgin who plans to stay one till marriage because of sexual trauma. \n\nI dated a guy for three months who lied a lot. It was the peak of my drinking problem (70 something days sober). I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend. He would drink nothing. I would go in my room thinking I passed out but we would still do sexual things that was not sex. Remember I am a virgin. \n\nOne night I got so drunk I don\u2019t remember making it to bed. He knew how much I drank. He never said anything. If anything encouraged by buying alcohol for me and my roommate. I woke up the next day with awful vaginal pain. When I peed it felt like my insides were ripped and I had blood in my urine. That lasted for three days before slowly fading away. When I asked my ex about it he said he used three fingers and that\u2019s why. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. \n\nI got drunk a few more times but not blackout and we do things again. I try to set boundaries with him about it realizing I needed to and he texted me \u201cI didn\u2019t rape you\u201d I didn\u2019t think anything of it because rape is such a triggering thing. I shut it down super quick. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is rape or not because when I would get drunk I would ask to have sex but he would say no. He knew I wanted to wait and he wanted to be a good boyfriend. But the three finger excuse didn\u2019t make sense because we consensually used that many before and it didn\u2019t feel that way. I didn\u2019t feel torn and I didn\u2019t bleed. Do you think he waited till I was so unconscious to do something? I didn\u2019t bring up rape in the text but he jumped right in like he was ready to defend himself. I understand it\u2019s a rough accusation but I don\u2019t understand why he jumped to it.  \n\nDo you think this sounds like rape?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 17, "end": 36, "span": "I think I was r**ed", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 443, "end": 456, "span": "sexual trauma", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 575, "end": 746, "span": "I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend.

{"id": "1381_ptsd", "displayed_text": "[NFSW] [Vent] [Trigger Warning] Feel like I won't recover It's difficult to believe if you look at me normally, or the way I talk about my family. I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.\n\nI tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.\n\nI just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? \n\nA few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.\n\nI feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. \n\nI think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future.

Sorry!\n\nI've always had anxiety but a little over a year ago I got the courage to solo-travel New Zealand long term. I gained a ton of confidence while doing this, and overcame a lot of my social anxiety. Eventually I got a job in Christchurch, it wasn't all perfect, I had my ups and downs but I was doing pretty well - going for walks frequently, exploring the city, living a 'normal life'.\n\nThen the shooting happened. To be clear, I didn't see/hear/experience anything. My life was never in actual danger, I was just living in the city at the time. At first it was disbelief, then fear (not knowing if they caught everyone) then crippling sadness. I had such a strong desire to run away and just go home but I couldn't right away. One of my coworkers was shot and spent months in ICU. I left Christchurch a little over a week after the attack. It felt wrong, but I had been offered a job back home and had already put my notice in at work.  \n\nAt first when I got back home and started my new job I was mostly fine. I was living with my parents until I could get an apartment in the city closer to work. I moved into my apartment in May and started having issues pretty quickly. Waking up multiple times a night, disoriented and sweaty. Random attacks of sadness and excessive anger over small problems. Being afraid of random people on the street. Wanting/needing to go do something (go to the store for example) and having a mental block. Anxiety over inconsequential things.\n\nI started going to therapy in June and he diagnosed me with PTSD. He gave me an ESA letter to get a dog which has helped immensely. But the therapy wasn't helping, my brain would kind of just shut off and I wouldn't have anything to say and I wouldn't remember anything he would say. It was really just giving me more anxiety so I stopped going.\n\nThe diagnosis just doesn't feel right to me. Maybe because I know I was never in any actual danger. I get intrusive memories of the sadness and aftermath though.  Recently I've been even more hyper-vigilant than usual. I listen to audiobooks at work so my mind doesn't wander but it makes me anxious because I don't always know when someone approaches me, and I jump when they do. I get anxious walking outside when its too quiet, dark, rainy (hood up, peripheral vision blocked) or too crowded, and I cant walk with headphones in. I feel like I am constantly stressed and anxious even though I have no real reason to be. I scratch at arms and hands and have a hard time making myself stop.\n\nI've always had problems with anxiety and mood swings so I'm having a hard time distinguishing from old symptoms and new.

{"id": "1400_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Can PTSD lead to psychosis? Here I am again. I've been posting on reddit before about my severe anxiety and fear of psychosis.\n\nBut still, as a background note:\nI am a 23 year old woman, currently unemployed, with no history of psychosis/schizophrenia in my family, but with history of trauma (bullying, abusive father, parental divorce, neurological illness of my twin brother). I'm currently living with my mother and twin brother.\n\nSo, because of the whole covid quarantine, I engaged in online therapy. I contacted a clinician psychologist  via a mental health website following a video evaluation and a series of tests for diagnosis. \nAfter all of them, I scored very high in most anxiety disorders which are: PTSD (highest), health anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and OCD.\nI also did a psychosis test which came out with 0 points result, meaning that I have no hallucination or delusion.\nShe adviced me to continue talk therapy and (optional) medication but accentuated the talk therapy. \n I'm currently still trying to save some money for the upcoming sessions so right now I can't attend them.\n\nThe thing is this: for the past month I've been dealing with derealization and been stuck inside my head all day.\nI have a huge fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia after accidentally coming across on google while searching for symptoms of dissociation.\n\nAs mentioned, I don't have hallucinations or delusions, but I experience some things maybe related to my PTSD. For example:\n- when my brother doesn't answer my phonecalls I get a panic attack and racing thoughts about something terribly happening to him (he is diagnosed with epilepsy).\n- I tend to avoid songs, places, movies, topics that remind myself of my trauma experiences, otherwise I think they might reoccur.\n- I have a tic that's lip picking, when i'm stressed or bored.\n- I have agoraphobia due to a traumatic event when I passed out 5 years ago (due to hypoglycemia) and always go out feeling tense and stuck in my head.\n- when I get derealization, I struggle to focus on my surroundings and my speech.\n- when I send a text to a friend or say something that might upset them, I think about that a lot of get scared of them wanting to distance from me (it happens only ocasionally, but it's still concerning me).\n- being stuck in my head, I became a bit less responsive to conversations with my family.\n\nMy traumas were triggered when I was 9,13,14 and 18.\nEver since the evaluation, I began to think a little more clear about my mental state but I still have the psychosis themed fear and the idea of losing my mind or losing control of myself terrifies me.\nIn the past year my self esteem has been very affected, I don't feel in control of myself and feel like I lost my independent life; I feel the need to rely on my mother and brother. Before that, I used to trust myself and my mother and brother relied on me too. They still do, but I feel like I'm the one who can't rely on myself.\nAll of this happened after getting the psychosis fear.\n\nI read somewhere that PTSD can come with secondary psychosis in a much higher rate than in general population and it scared me badly considering my phobia.\nI feel like I need more information on this, as my fear convinces me that because I have PTSD, I might get psychosis too.\nAre there any important details about this?

I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still can't get over this betrayal. I'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? Hate? He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I'm grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and that's it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night.

It's like I'm simultaneously trying to avoid it and think about it. I feel like I got left behind in my initial trauma and then time just kept progressing without me when that happened, and now this has happened it's the same thing where I'm just stuk in the moments before it happened onstantly trying to understand why anything ould have happened after that that wasn't aording to my plan that I'd now onvined myself would keep going and just what the fuk happened and until I understand all of these things in my life now I don't give a SHIT about and I also everytime I remember...
