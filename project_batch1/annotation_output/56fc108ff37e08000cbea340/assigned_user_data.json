He keeps telling me about his days and then ending with \"oh sorry, I always make it about me,\" and I know him well enough to know he is not intending that statement in a passive aggressive manner, that's just his way of saying he feels he made another mistake through a text.\n\nI feel so guilty because every strong feeling I had for him immediately vanished, I don't want to hurt him, and (selfishly) I don't want to be so alone again. But now he reminds me of the assault in the spring, I dont know how to move forward or mend this situation. \n\nSorry for the long post, it's my first one and I felt context was necessary, any advice would be helpful.
