I welcomed my biggest blessing my son on feb 4th, then 9 days later that joy turned to the most traumatic thing I\u2019ve ever experienced. \n\nA quick back story: I had my child when i was 21. The birth of my son was very painless and the whole experience was very positive. No painful contractions, no complications with the csection or anything.\n\nBack to the story. after a csection they give you narcotic pain meds. On feb 13th i started weening myself off the pills because i wasn\u2019t in that much pain anymore. That whole day i felt like something was off in my body. I had chills but my body was hot and i felt nauseous. I figured it was the effects from no longer taking the pain meds. After hours of not feeling well my dad took my temperature and it was 104.3. My dad kept my baby while my boyfriend took me to the hospital. \n\nUpon arriving and telling them my symptoms i was immediately swarmed my so many doctors and nurses like the scene of a movie. They asked millions of questions and stuck IV\u2019s and sensors all over me. \n\nFast forward i learn i have sepsis and a blood clot in my ovarian vein.

Wrong. \n\nI spent 2 weeks in the hospital and i barely have any memory of most of it but i remember flashes. \n\nDuring that time i had several blood transfusions, blood drawn every 3 hours everyday for 2 weeks and they stuck me in a different vein every time, got given heparin (blood thinner) for the blood clot which they later realized i was allergic to do they switched me to another blood thinner, got given so many different antibiotics for the sepsis, had 3 different IV\u2019s at the same time and a PICC line, had a foley Catheter and a feeding tube, was in the icu in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator, had to do physical therapy to walk, had to get my lungs drained after catching pneumonia from the ventilator, had to get fluid sucked out of my abdomen via ct machine needle insertion, and so many tests and labs i can\u2019t keep up. \n\nWas sent home with 11 prescription as well as a blood thinner injection i had to give myself everyday.

I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who do have PTSD and struggle with its symptoms. The last thing I want is to go around waving that phrase around carelessly and take away from those who have it.\nSeveral months ago, my fiance had a seizure in my dorm. He has epilepsy so I've always had it in the back of my mind that if I notice anything weird to remain calm, but he is on meds for it and I had never witnessed a seizure before, so seeing him just stare at me and start screeching and convulsing out of the blue one afternoon took me by surprise.  I remained relatively ca and waited it out since he told me before that I shouldn't call an ambulance unless the seizure lasts a long time. I counted less than two minutes, which is fine. When he opened his eyes again, he didn't speak or seem like himself. He was just trying to  get up and climb on furniture while i tried my best to keep him from hurting himself. Eventually, he regained consciousness and asked what happened. I offered to take him to the hospital to get checked out since his dad recommended it over the phone, but he refused. A little later after he was back to normal he was on the phone, and my head rested on his lap. One minute he was talking, then the next minute I heard that awful screech again and jumped up. After two seizures, i decided to just call 911. He went to the hospital and all was well. \nFor a long time, and even to this day, if he's joking around and accidentally makes a sound like he did or moves too suddenly, I panic for a second before realizing he isn't having a seizure. Early in I used to snap and get so angry at him for making weird sounds that sounded like that, but he honestly doesn't know what he sounds like during seizures and didn't mean to upset me, so i have gotten better about being more fair to him. We are long distance right now, and even when other people around me make strange sounds I feel my heart drop and I get so upset thinking that they could be having one even though no one in my family has ever had it. It gets me kind of angry to be frightened like that and ready to spring to action if need be only to find they're just being weird or having other less urgent issues.

{"id": "468_ptsd", "displayed_text": "New to Reddit and this diagnosis // I have questions *Hello, before i start this weird post that i'm pretty sure nobody will end up reading let me get a couple things situated. Hi, i'm Uncomfy and i'm new to Reddit. I made this account because specific people in my life say that i have too many issues and i'm uncomfortable to be around. So i made this account specifically for asking questions about things that relate to mental health, and occasionally things i like to indulge in to keep myself preoccupied from the outside world. Hopefully this will cause my issue of being an uncomfortable person.Before i start i must specify that i am not making anything i say up or am doing this for attention. I have no idea how Reddit works, so i apologize if i don't do things that people may find mandatory. (I would appreciate They/them pronouns if you end up responding to this post please.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it.

{"id": "1191_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Bullying gave me anxiety, anxiety made me an alcoholic and drug abuser, alcoholism gave me chronic gastrointestinal pain, and chronic gastrointestinal pain gave me intense homicidal feelings. I dropped out of school during my last year of high school because of extremely high levels of anxiety. This severe anxiety disorder started nearly a decade ago, because of the bullying I went through in middle school. I suffer from uncontrollable panic attacks (I would qualify those panic attacks as small heart attacks, given their intensity).\n\nMy first real panic attack happened back when I was in 8th grade (in 2007) and my phone got stolen from my backpack during PE. This might not seem catastrophic, but with this phone, I (stupidly) recorded myself jerking off while I was bored a few months prior , and I didn't erased the video (I know that it's dumb, but I was 13 at this time, and teens do stupid shit all the time). I completely forgot that this video was still on my phone's memory card, so when I figured out I got robbed, I was just angry about losing my phone, and about not knowing who stole it. I didn't realized what was about to happen. So I got home, (I lived with my mom back in middle school) told my mom that my phone got stolen, and she called the telephone operator to deactivate the sim card. To me it was no big deal....\n\nThe real drama started the following day, when I got back to school, and got laughed at by literally almost a hundred kids. I didn't understand why everybody was laughing hilariously, and then someone said to me \"I saw you beating your meat dude !\". I still didn't get it, then I remembered about the video I filmed a few months before with my phone, that I didn't erased.\n\nI got ridiculed for the rest of my middle school years because of this, kids called me various degrading names, like faggot, pervert, wanker, weirdo etc.... During this time I began to sweat a lot because of anxiety, so I smelled like sweat all the time, so people humiliated me because of it, for example, one day during a math class, a girl complained to the teacher that I stink, and that she doesn't want to sit next to me, because my body odor makes her gag, of course everybody started laughing at me, even the teacher had a smirk on his face, but the teacher didn't let her move to another place.\n\nI got beaten a lot, because I used to be skinny and short as a teenager, so I was an easy target, I got violently beaten countless times in the locker room during my middle school years, someone spat on me once, It is extremely humiliating to be spat on, I got treated like a pariah, like a punching bag (and I never reported it to the school administration or the police, out of shame, I never even told my parents about it to this day, and I regret not doing it, because there could have been an investigation to find out who stole that phone). The video was shared phone by phone, via Bluetooth, so my entire school saw me choking the chicken (seriously !).\n\nI live in Martinique, an island in the middle of the caribbean. This island is part of France, so I'm French, but Martinique is a very ghetto and rough place. Living here feels more like Jamaica, or Brazilian favelas, than France. I've been to ghetto schools. The schools I went through were very ghetto-ish. The kind of schools where kids do drugs at 11, where a good portion of the girls get pregnant before 18. It is very traumatizing to get beaten by 5 or more kids. It feels like your manhood is taken away from you. People pick up on anxious vibes, and treat you like garbage because of it. Now I have PTSD from all this physical and verbal abuse.\n\nThe bullying greatly diminished in high school, because I went to a high school away from my hometown, where nobody saw this video. I moved from my mom's house to my dad's house, but the damage was already done. In high school, I got teased a little bit because people could notice my severe anxiety, for example people in high school used to tell me that I walk like I have a broomstick stuck up in my ass, and other hurtful things like that, but it was nothing compared to what I went through during middle school.\n\nBecause of all of this, I stupidly became a full-blown alcoholic during high school, to cope with anxiety / depression. I also heavily used drugs. This heavy alcohol and drug use led to all those health problems I have now. I want to commit suicide because I suffer from extreme anxiety, agoraphobia, chronic stomach pains and severe headaches. I went to a GP, I explained to him all my symptoms, then this GP sent me to a gastroenterologist, a neurologist, and a psychologist. The psychologist prescribed Xanax and Klonopin, and I did CBT for 4 months, but it didn't help me. The gastroenterologist and the neurologist got multiple tests done on me: A gastroscopy, MRI, blood tests, etc... but unfortunately they didn't figure out what's wrong with me.\n\nI'm currently unemployed, I live with my father, and he is threatening to kick me out of the house. He has been very patient with me, but his patience is running out. I totally understand that he is not immortal, and he wants me to be independent, I don't hate him or anything, I love him, but how can I hold a job when I'm severely physically sick, and I have no diplomas, because I didn't graduate from high school ? From these years of intense bullying, I developed an extremely severe anxiety problem, and even almost 10 years after this happened, I still struggle with even basic human interaction.\n\nThis made me completely hateful of people, even though I know not everybody is a piece of shit. This left me in a state of perpetual, uncontrollable anxiety. I absolutely hate every single human being on Earth. If I do get a job, I will die from a stroke or a heart attack because of anxiety. I tried to get a disability allowance, but it got rejected TWICE. I lost pretty much all hope, and I feel like going on a killing spree at this point. I feel like going to a place where a lot of people gather, then cowardly killing as many people as I possibly can, The only thing preventing me from going on a killing spree is my belief in some form of reincarnation after death. If I go on a killing spree, there's only 2 options afterwards:\n\nOPTION 1): I surrender to the police, I get sent to prison, and the prison where I will spend the rest of my life is a dirty, severely overcrowded mess. There's no protective custody there. This prison is organized in dorms, each one full of 40 to 50 violent people, high on crack/meth, HIV positive, murderers, thieves, rapists, etc.... I don't want to go to prison.\n\nOPTION 2): I commit suicide to avoid prison bullying, but unfortunately, instead of finding eternal peace, I'll find temporary peace, then I'm going to be reborn as some creature on another planet somewhere far away from Earth, maybe as a penguin-like creature, and instead of having a good time in my next life surrounded by my new penguin friends, I'm going to get gang raped and abused because of bad karma. Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vs1d0fNEsE) poor fellow. What goes around comes around. I can avoid human justice easily, but unfortunately, I can't avoid the Universal justice system. I hate this world.\n\nI hate this life so much, this life feels like a punishment. No matter what I do, I always end up getting fucked over. I fucking hate life. I want to say thank you to anyone reading this long wall of text, and sorry for the eventual grammatical errors, because English is not my main language (I'm French) Sharing life experiences with strangers on the Internet is helping me. I don't really plan on killing anyone, so don't call the cops on me, I'm just venting on the Internet.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 542, "end": 4319, "span": "My first real panic attack happened back when I was in 8th grade (in 2007) and my phone got stolen from my backpack during PE. This might not seem catastrophic, but with this phone, I (stupidly) recorded myself jerking off while I was bored a few months prior , and I didn't erased the video (I know that it's dumb, but I was 13 at this time, and teens do stupid shit all the time). I completely forgot that this video was still on my phone's memory card, so when I figured out I got robbed, I was just angry about losing my phone, and about not knowing who stole it. I didn't realized what was about to happen. So I got home, (I lived with my mom back in middle school) told my mom that my phone got stolen, and she called the telephone operator to deactivate the sim card. To me it was no big deal....\r\n\r\nThe real drama started the following day, when I got back to school, and got laughed at by literally almost a hundred kids. I didn't understand why everybody was laughing hilariously, and then someone said to me \"I saw you beating your meat dude !\". I still didn't get it, then I remembered about the video I filmed a few months before with my phone, that I didn't erased.\r\n\r\nI got ridiculed for the rest of my middle school years because of this, kids called me various degrading names, like faggot, pervert, wanker, weirdo etc.... During this time I began to sweat a lot because of anxiety, so I smelled like sweat all the time, so people humiliated me because of it, for example, one day during a math class, a girl complained to the teacher that I stink, and that she doesn't want to sit next to me, because my body odor makes her gag, of course everybody started laughing at me, even the teacher had a smirk on his face, but the teacher didn't let her move to another place.\r\n\r\nI got beaten a lot, because I used to be skinny and short as a teenager, so I was an easy target, I got violently beaten countless times in the locker room during my middle school years, someone spat on me once, It is extremely humiliating to be spat on, I got treated like a pariah, like a punching bag (and I never reported it to the school administration or the police, out of shame, I never even told my parents about it to this day, and I regret not doing it, because there could have been an investigation to find out who stole that phone). The video was shared phone by phone, via Bluetooth, so my entire school saw me choking the chicken (seriously !).\r\n\r\nI live in Martinique, an island in the middle of the caribbean. This island is part of France, so I'm French, but Martinique is a very ghetto and rough place. Living here feels more like Jamaica, or Brazilian favelas, than France. I've been to ghetto schools. The schools I went through were very ghetto-ish. The kind of schools where kids do drugs at 11, where a good portion of the girls get pregnant before 18. It is very traumatizing to get beaten by 5 or more kids. It feels like your manhood is taken away from you. People pick up on anxious vibes, and treat you like garbage because of it. Now I have PTSD from all this physical and verbal abuse.\r\n\r\nThe bullying greatly diminished in high school, because I went to a high school away from my hometown, where nobody saw this video. I moved from my mom's house to my dad's house, but the damage was already done. In high school, I got teased a little bit because people could notice my severe anxiety, for example people in high school used to tell me that I walk like I have a broomstick stuck up in my ass, and other hurtful things like that, but it was nothing compared to what I went through during middle school.\r\n\r\nBecause of all of this, I stupidly became a full-blown alcoholic during high school, to cope with anxiety / depression. I also heavily used drugs.", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 10s "}}
