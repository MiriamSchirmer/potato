And if I claim that I cut off contact because they are not good for me, does that mean I am blaming the victim? I have been abused in childhood but I also dealt with my abuse in all the wrong ways, and I became abusive myself (not to this person) in the past. However I am completely reformed now, in a lot of therapy, but I am so, so scared of messing up again accidentally by not knowing what is abuse and what isn\u2019t.

I am pretty sure it was mostly due to my own trauma including being sexually assaulted and then the DA office not taking me seriously at all is why I got kinda upset. And I will admit, I haven't worked much on that trauma since I'm also bipolar and those symptoms often take precedence over my PTSD. \n\nBut it's been a few hours since the show and now I'm jumpy as *hell*. My poor nephew thinks I'm mad at him for making noise and potentially waking up his baby sister, but I am just startled as fuck when he is making loud noises unintentionally.

{"id": "1933_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Struggling to cope I've had PTSD for around 10 years now. First, it was all from how traumatic everything was when I saw my dad die and then when some things happened with my ex boyfriend. I'm now married and my husband doesn't believe that PTSD is a real thing. My mother in law just thinks I'm being dramatic about all of it. Last night, I had some bad nightmares and this morning, my husband woke me up by grabbing my arm and getting in my face (new anxiety meds put me in a deep sleep). I told him to get off of me and to stop touching me multiple times and he still kept doing it. It triggered everything and just made me freak out. I ran to the bathroom to be alone but he followed me and banged on the bathroom door calling my name which made everything even more worse. When I managed to get out to take some anxiety meds, he still got in my face and would not leave me alone and eventually ended up throwing my phone at me hard and calling his mom to tell her everything. As usual, he response was that I'm being dramatic and overreacting. \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the nightmares and my husband and his family not understanding what I'm going through.im tired of constantly being told I'm being dramatic.

I'm mostly posting this just to get it off my chest, but any advice you can give me would be super appreciated.\n\nI'm freaking out right now. My rabbit is sick, and we don't know what's wrong. She finally stabilised today, and the vet was frankly shocked that she survived. He's running some tests now to determine what caused this episode (GI stasis and hypothermia, in case you were wondering). Thing is, this is a huge trigger for me and I have no idea why. \n\nThe things that happened to me when I was a child were physical in nature for the most part, the only \"traumatic\" event I can think of that involved a pet was when my mother accidentally reversed over our (very old and deaf) cat while I was in the car. It was upsetting certainly, but compared to the other things that happened it seems \"minor\".\n\nWe lost another rabbit about 6 months ago to a tumor on her heart, and that broke me. I had to take time off work (I still haven't gone back) and that episode finally pushed me to seek therapy. At the time, I saw it more as the straw that broke the camel's back, but now I'm wondering if maybe there's something more.\n\nI fucking hate this all consuming anxiety. I can barely function. I can't eat, I barely sleep, I've had constant nightmares, and I've just burned through my anti-anxiety meds. I'm even doing the hyper-vigilance thing with my other pets now, analysing their every move for any signs of illness. I know intellectually that they're okay, but I can't stop freaking the fuck out about it. \n\nWorse still, my partner is dealing with their own anxiety so I can't lay this all on them either without making them feel awful.\n\nRereading this it looks like I've got some serious trigger bullshit going on here, but I have no idea what it could be.\n\nI'm just ranting at this point, but it feels a little better to have it written down.

{"id": "2306_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Guilt for Having PTSD Hi. I just joined this community because I was feeling alone in my mental struggle.\n\nI was recently diagnosed with PTSD but I feel extremely guilty saying I have it. Mainly, because when I read the things most people who have PTSD have gone through, I feel like I don\u2019t deserve to have it. You are all so strong and amazing and I don\u2019t think I could have survived or functioned through even half of the stuff you guys have.\n\nThe reason I have PTSD is because I experienced loss and change and ups and downs very quickly and simultaneously all at once and I think the whiplash is getting me. But, mostly, I was in a very toxic job and I had two bosses that just sucked the life out of me. They teased me for having anxiety and tried to ruin my chances of ever being hired anywhere else. They were controlling and condescending and two faced and I got to a point where I could barely walk in the work building without thinking I was having a heart attack.\n\nI\u2019m finally out of that job and on to better things, but the PTSD still gets me. I still get really really angry out of nowhere. I cry uncontrollably for what feels like no reason. I remember all the things that were said to me by my previous bosses and I swear it feels like I\u2019m reliving it all over again. I can\u2019t make it go away.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m posting this. I feel weak and dumb for saying it on a forum where, like I said, so many people have it a million times worse. I feel pathetic that just a little job situation has given me diagnosed PTSD ... and I haven\u2019t been in war or gone through abuse ... like how can I even have the right to say that??? I wish I was stronger mentally. I wish I wasn\u2019t frail and scared and pathetic ... and I wish my body and mind didn\u2019t see all this as traumatic to me. I\u2019m mad tonight ... and I feel like my mental progress is like taking 5 steps forward and 7 steps back. And I don\u2019t know ...
