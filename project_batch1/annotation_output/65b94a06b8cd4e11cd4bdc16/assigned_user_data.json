This is probably not the place to ask, but I\u2019ve had a lot of support in this sub from my other posts, so I figured it would be okay. \n\nI have a \u201cfriend\u201d who is essentially a pathological liar and has a history of doing unscrupulous things, and I kept forgiving them in the past, but I was thinking I was ready to stop having that kind of unnecessary bs in my life and just stop contact with them, since it wasn\u2019t doing anything good for my life and could honestly be dangerous since they have a history of suing people, making false accusations, etc.\n\nBut I heard on a post online that \u201cwithholding contact as punishment\u201d is a form of abuse, and I do not know if this applies here. And if I claim that I cut off contact because they are not good for me, does that mean I am blaming the victim? I have been abused in childhood but I also dealt with my abuse in all the wrong ways, and I became abusive myself (not to this person) in the past. However I am completely reformed now, in a lot of therapy, but I am so, so scared of messing up again accidentally by not knowing what is abuse and what isn\u2019t. Can someone help me figure out if this is abuse or is it okay to stop talking to this person?"}, "1935_counseling": {"id": "1935_counseling", "text": "I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her.

This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious\u2014they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.\n   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages.
