Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything. Plotted suicide. \n\nIts been 15 years and it has been replaying in my head ever since. I have difficultly making friends. I stay home most weekends. I feel i will never amount to anything. On the outside I look successful. I work at a great company, I go to night class to further my career, I was a successful amateur boxer, I have a great family and girlfriend. But I cannot shake this event. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living. \n\nI started going to therapy consistently in 2016. I have done talk therapy, cbt, EMDR, energy healing,... I am lost. I hope I can get through this but there are times I feel I will never be confident. I still binge drink and still go through depressive spells. I wonder how my life would be if this didn't happen. It has been 15 years. \n\nIf you have taken the time to read this I really appreciate it. I know time is very valuable and this is a rambled wall of text.

As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything. That worked okay for a few years, although I was really struggling mentally during that time, but then the wheels just came off at some point where I was too messed up in the brain to operate normally in society.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would get these nightmares that were so bad that they wanted to use me as an experiment for a new drug that's being trialed for use by the U.S. Military. I forget what it's called but essentially it's this blood pressure medication, but when you take it you never dream again for the rest of your life. I mean these nightmares were so insane I actually thought I might be possessed by a demon and considered seeking help from a priest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would get this anxiety that got so bad that I could not turn my back to someone or all this other weird shit. I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from. It was like I was being poisoned surreptitiously or something. I thought I was a tough guy but this was like physiological in nature. It made me so sick sometimes that I'd puke for days and not be able to sleep and I'd get dehydrated and have to go to the ER and get saline and a MRI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I went to some therapist because I thought I had an anxiety disorder or something, but they were like no you got PTSD. I didn't believe it at the time, I was like \"yeah right\", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood/brain/skull/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some \"creative\" interrogation or whatever) they never recover.

Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say \"hands kill\" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people.

I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to my little monologue.

I had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger.

My therapist (who I switched to about 6 months ago as my last therapist was useless) told me very bluntly that if I don\u2019t get my shit together that I will die by my own hand before I die of old age. She said people like me often don\u2019t make it. She also said my parents expect that I will die from suicide. It shook me to my core.
