Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it.

The symptoms I\u2019ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I\u2019ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I\u2019m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. \n\nFor example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can\u2019t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn\u2019t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember. For weeks after, the topic of volleyball caused great stress to me. \n\nThe thought of practicing or going to games caused panic attacks. When I thought of the event my core would seize up, heart rate would increase, limbs would start trembling, and sometimes my breathing would speed up or become sporadic. A bit like a mini panic attack, without all the symptoms or duration (these episodes lasted a few seconds, 10 at the most).  \n\nI would avoid the topic of volleyball for weeks after, even stopping reading a book series that mentioned volleyball because it reminded me too much of the event. I would lose interest in volleyball, despite me actually really enjoying it. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years, but thinking of this instance still causes some of these symptoms, to a lesser degree. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had nightmares about this specific situation, but similar events have had negative influences on my dreams in the past. \n\nI\u2019ve provided examples of these symptoms in relation to /just one/ event, but keep in mind this still occurs for all of my most stressful experiences which are numerous. \n\nIdk.

I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers", "displayed_text": "Some thoughts on dissociation?

But no, I wasn\u2019t overweight and he FORCED me to workout. By my senior year of high school his obsession grew even grater. He was weighing me every morning and making me do more intense workouts to lose weight. I ended up weighing 117 lbs by the middle of my senior year. I was so skinny that I looked unhealthy, my collarbones would pop out. I wouldn\u2019t eat much around friends because I was afraid that if I did eat like a normal person, I\u2019d gain weight so I just told my friends excuses like I wasn\u2019t hungry or I had already eaten earlier.

I would only get my phone/car/friend privileges back if I weighed 117 lbs the next day. Weeks would go by and I would be stuck at 118-119 lbs, and even though I was doing all the workouts he made me do and barely eating, my weight would fluctuate, especially during my time of the month.

I suffer from diagnosed anxiety, depression and PTSD from my childhood up until my early adult years. He still hasn\u2019t apologized for anything that he\u2019s done, nor realizes that he\u2019s the main reason I have those disorders. I\u2019ve tried to tell him repeatedly that what he did and what he continues to do is not right (no physical abuse anymore, just emotional and mental), including making me feel guilty for things or bad about myself. He also blames everyone else for getting arrested the day he hit my mother. I don\u2019t know what else to do to help him change or to at least recognize what he\u2019s been doing has truly damaged me. Every time I notice that he\u2019s trying to be a better person and try to mend the relationship with me, a fight happens and the unhealthy cycle starts again."}, "2220_incel": {"id": "2220_incel", "text": " Naw, i stay with mother.
