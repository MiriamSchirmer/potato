{"id": "2526_counseling", "displayed_text": "My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now.  Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another.  That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed.  The next two days were a repetition of the first day.  On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house.  I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple.  It was very hard for us.  His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had.  I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home.  There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot.  Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month.  After that, it was a downward spiral.  We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families.  We kept having the famous \"you're doing it wrong\u2014do it this way\" argument.  After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started.  One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me.  I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one.  He told me to let him leave or he would hit me.  He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it.  He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me.  I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now.  I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children.  We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly.  He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change.  Now he just wants me to understand why he does it and how I don't ever make the effort to try to be okay.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1501, "end": 1728, "span": " He told me to let him leave or he would hit me.

{"id": "2534_ptsd", "displayed_text": "My toxic relationship with my dad is still affecting me As a young girl, my father was always hard on me... a little more than my brother. Always strict with my grades (understandable), but he also had a control problem. He always had to control everything relating to my family, even controlled my mother to the point where she wasn\u2019t allowed to spend any money from her own paycheck or wear any makeup to work. He was also emotionally &amp; mentally abusive to her, and emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive to my brother &amp; I on a daily basis (again, I always got it more than him). \n\nWhen I was a sophomore in high school, I was 5\u20195\u201d and a healthy 135-140 lbs. I was a small in tops and about a 6 in jeans, so I was never really considered fat or even overweight, just healthy. During this year, my dad became weirdly obsessed with my weight. He would force me to run and do at home exercises daily, he would also weigh me about once a week. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I feel like if I were the slightest bit overweight/unhealthy then maybe he could of approached differently, like suggesting to eat better or maybe join him in some of his workouts. But no, I wasn\u2019t overweight and he FORCED me to workout. By my senior year of high school his obsession grew even grater. He was weighing me every morning and making me do more intense workouts to lose weight. I ended up weighing 117 lbs by the middle of my senior year. I was so skinny that I looked unhealthy, my collarbones would pop out. I wouldn\u2019t eat much around friends because I was afraid that if I did eat like a normal person, I\u2019d gain weight so I just told my friends excuses like I wasn\u2019t hungry or I had already eaten earlier. They would always tell me that I was too skinny and if everything was okay with me. I would end up telling my parents and my dad would respond with \u201cthey say that because they are jealous.\u201d \n\nIf I didn\u2019t weigh 117 lbs every morning- for example, if I weighted the SLIGHTEST bit over 117, like 117.4 lbs then he\u2019d take my phone away for the day, it would also cause him to get mad at me for gaining an extra 0.4 lbs which would usually end up in a verbal fight and then him hitting me (at 18 years old- and even though I was technically 18 he still controlled everything in my life... my phone, the money that I made at my part time jobs, my car).  I would only get my phone/car/friend privileges back if I weighed 117 lbs the next day. Weeks would go by and I would be stuck at 118-119 lbs, and even though I was doing all the workouts he made me do and barely eating, my weight would fluctuate, especially during my time of the month. So I would go weeks without my phone even though I was driving from school to work/cheerleading practice, so if something were to happen while I was driving I had no way of calling for help. \n\nI remember not having a phone to take pictures with my friends on graduation day because I weighed the slightest bit over 117. This obsession continued into my freshman year of college when he forced me to live at home and commute to still have every bit of control over me. So, it was another year of weighing me every morning, physical &amp; emotional abuse if I didn\u2019t weigh what he wanted me to. I remember one day weighing 120 lbs and he looked at me like he was disgusted by the 3 pounds I had gained and called me fat, and would point out and say that my legs were already bigger from the day before even though I physically still looked the same, but my weight would change because, like I said, it is normal for your weight to fluctuate a couple of pounds. This minor change in weight could be cause by lots of things like retaining water. This continued up until the July before I started my sophomore year of college. \n\nThat July, he was mandated to leave my house because him and my mom were fighting and he hit her in the face and she told me to call the police, so I did. When he was getting escorted out by the police, I remember him turning to me and saying \u201cyou\u2019re the devil. I hate you.\u201d But what else was I going to do? He literally HIT my mom in the face, let alone the lifetime of physical abuse he caused to my brother and I. Fast forward 4 years.... I live with my mom, and my dad and I have a rocky relationship. I love him because he\u2019s my dad. I know he\u2019s always wanted the best for me but due to his narcissistic and controlling ways, he\u2019s had an awful way of showing it. I suffer from diagnosed anxiety, depression and PTSD from my childhood up until my early adult years. He still hasn\u2019t apologized for anything that he\u2019s done, nor realizes that he\u2019s the main reason I have those disorders. I\u2019ve tried to tell him repeatedly that what he did and what he continues to do is not right (no physical abuse anymore, just emotional and mental), including making me feel guilty for things or bad about myself. He also blames everyone else for getting arrested the day he hit my mother. I don\u2019t know what else to do to help him change or to at least recognize what he\u2019s been doing has truly damaged me. Every time I notice that he\u2019s trying to be a better person and try to mend the relationship with me, a fight happens and the unhealthy cycle starts again.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 795, "end": 5230, "span": "During this year, my dad became weirdly obsessed with my weight.
