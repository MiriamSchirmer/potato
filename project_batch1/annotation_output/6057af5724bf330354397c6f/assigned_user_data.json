She decides she wants to use protection and not have my kids now and came out of the blue with it and that hurt.  Then she didnt want me going to her kids school stuff. \n\nI went from being able to talk to this girl about anything and touch her whenever I want, all the way to she wont touch me and she wont talk to me without being cold and defensive.\n\nI didnt understand anything and I was getting hurt by all this.  I do alot for her and she knows that.  I never hold it over her at all.  I just want the intimacy and relationship back that we had.\n\nFinally the other day we had the biggest fight and everything was on the table.  I felt used and lied to.  I felt hurt by what was happening.  I've given her my all and I thought we were in love.  \n\nFor some reason she finally said something that helped me understand that it wasnt me.  It's not that she isnt attracted to me.  It's not that she doesnt love me.  She is dealing with something in her head that she isnt ready to tell me or cant even describe.  \n\nI want to be there for her.  I want to be with her.  How do I be supportive in the best way.  I dont want to suffocate her or make her feel pressured.  Is there a way for us to work through this and get back to where we were?\n\nI may have missed a few details but I'm writing this on the fly, any actual advice is welcome and appreciated."}, "601_incel": {"id": "601_incel", "text": " Im against sex.

A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn\u2019t stand with out pain.\nFor the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I\u2019d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn\u2019t go in I\u2019d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn\u2019t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.\nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time\n\nIv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can\u2019t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don\u2019t really talk in therapy session and the reply\u2019s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school\n\nThere\u2019s an emotion I feel when I\u2019m in a state sometimes, it\u2019s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.

And usally I cant find an explanation for what I\u2019m experiencing and I\u2019m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can\u2019t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state.
