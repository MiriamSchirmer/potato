I know he didn't have a great childhood and has struggled with addiction, anxiety and depression most of his adult life. He is 48 and we have only been together 6 years. I don't know what the trauma was that caused it but to be honest, I really want to ask. I'm not sure if I should ask though.

I wanted to share here because this sub looked so supportive and because something has been plaguing me for a while. I just decided to make a new account since I couldn't hold this in any longer.  \nTrigger warning for some; child sexual abuse, crude jokes  \nI recently went through an involuntary hospitalization (related to perceived suicidal ideation) and some of my typical behaviours and quirks caused a psychologist to take me aside and ask if I potentially had PTSD. I assumed she wanted this information to diagnose me or put it on my precautions sheet\\*. While curious, I prompted her to share why she thought so, and she replied with, \"I noticed you've been very startled at loud noises throughout the day. At times, you would stare into space and that concerned me.\" Now, I was curious. Although I had a fair share of PTSD-knowledge, I mostly comforted myself with the fact that a lot of them are veterans and just...nullified the possibility of me having it.   \nNow, the quirks I demonstrated were, as aforementioned, me jumping at loud noises and loud voices, being sensitive to touch, and also a strange blanking out. I don't remember what one would call it, but it strikes me as a whelming of thoughts about my \"trauma\" (which I'll explain below) and I can't help it when I'm in it. I feel like I'm there, but I don't hallucinate about it. It's just all the feelings of it, and it feels *terrible* when I have these spouts. I don't know if flashbacks are like this, but I'll read more around this sub and try to pinpoint the exact definition of whatever a flashback feels like.   \nSo, my trauma. To put it short, I was raped by two guys (one over the age of consent, and the other almost there) at the age of 11. When I was 13, I was molested by an uncle. I'm 16 now. I've just been trying to deal with it by...joking. That's the only coping mechanism I have. I, at times, even joke about my trauma. Once, I joked about how I \"need to keep my grades up, otherwise, I'd just be a sex doll.\" It hurts, though. I can't stop thinking about how the incident was and sometimes I'm a ball of tears because of it.   \nSo, what do you guys think? Should I just get over it, or do I have PTSD?

{"id": "69_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Paranoia about Being Bullied Again So I took CBD today and it calmed me down mentally to allow me to be more conscious of all the thoughts I have. I realized (what I already knew, but now more so than before) that I always feel like people are laughing at me and judging me. I noticed that when I was walking on the sidewalk today that I had all this mental dialogue going on (almost like schizophrenia) hearing all the imagined voices of the people driving past me making fun of me and laughing at me. Laughing at what I wore, laughing at my face, laughing at my walk. I was afraid that one of them would be someone I knew or worse, one of the people who bullied me.\n\nSo for the first time I truly acknowledged my anxiety and asked why I felt this way....by doing so I confirmed a belief I previously only partly held.\n\n*It is that because I was bullied by so many people (like 15) (ostracized, yelled at, made fun of and told constantly that no one liked me) that it must have been my fault, or else why would so many people mistreat me and even the ones that didnt partake just allow the abuse to happen and even become friends with these people? If they were really doing something wrong surely no one would willingly befriend bullies or not stand up to them when it happened everyday right? Because everyone knew it was going on, they all saw. It must be my fault of this allowed to happen. So I thought that since I caused it, there is something about me that will cause this to happen with other people aswell. Thus i see everyone as a potential bully, and no self talk changed the anxiety when I was out today***\n\nI saw someone I knew and though she smiled at me I shut down and after our conversation I just wanted to go home and I wasn\u2019t even present the entire time, my mind kept going back to memories of being yelled at and made fun of the whole conversation even though she was laughing with me. I kept going numb because I felt like if I emotionally checked out, then any bullying that I expected on her part wouldn\u2019t affect me because I wasn\u2019t emotionally there in the first place. All of which I became aware of is something that always happens but cbd made me more conscious of it, it made me more conscious of things that had already been there but I just ignored/I had been denying because I didn\u2019t want to accept that I was mentally ill. \n\nSo how do I, I guess stop thinking that I was at fault for being bullied, or even if I WAS doing something wrong that they just exaggerated my flaws and that I am not a monster that will just be rejected and made fun of by everyone across the board?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 215, "end": 275, "span": " always feel like people are laughing at me and judging me.

{"id": "48_ptsd", "displayed_text": "How can i help my 16year old friend with PTSD Hey folks so heres the deal,\n\nBackground: my 16 year old friend just came out about sexual and physical abuse from her asshole father 2 months ago. There is an ongoing complex intense court battle between the 2 of them and her family (who admittedly have always been distant) have chosen to side with the father and isolate/ostracize my friend. She has been on and off again homeless, and because of this, she made the healthy decision to move in with me and has become apart of my family. \nI love my friend, she desperately wants to overcome this but is struggling with a lot of symptoms, and myself and my parents want to learn how to help her any way we can. \nShe has these dreams where she wakes up panicking and sweating. Last time she told me that she couldnt stop going over what happened in her head, and although i stayed with her, it took a long time for her to fall back asleep.\nShe also has flashbacks where she goes in and out of the present and past. For example last week after volleyball she was triggered by the noisy change room and ended up standing in the corner unresponsive to anyone repeating the words \"its my fault\". I ended up getting her alone away from the rest of the team but i need strategies on how to get her out of the flashback. Ive noticed that when shes a present the hypersensitivity kicks in and everythings crazy loud for her but then she cant hear anything when shes back in her flashback. Sometimes it helps to give a hug or hold her hand sometimes it terrifies or irritates her. I dont know how to get her out of it and i hate to see her that terrified. \nThe hypersensitivity can be super hard too around the house, sometimes shes able to say that something like the dryer is too loud otherwise we'll find her in the corner of her room with her head between her legs in a panic attack. \nWe desperately want strategies to help bring her out of a flashback/dissociation, panic attack, night terrors and just the general feeling of loneliness and betrayal she deals with daily. Also note we just started her with a counsellor who she says is helping a lot, this is just for at home and school.
