I found something that works for me, and I thought I would share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm currently unemployed and not in school. I am taking a pause on life to get better after years of unsuccessfully trying to outrun this thing. And, at first, the pause was doing more harm than good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've found that volunteering at the humane society has been a game changer. It gives me something worthwhile to do, puts me in the community, and I get to talk with little kids who come in. I will spent up to 3 hours there, spending 95% of my time petting kitties. Today one cat, who is in isolation and is terrified of all people, finally let me pet her. She licked and rubbed up against me. I feel like I've actually accomplished something since I've been on break. I've made a small difference to that cat with my compassion and patience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is just a trigger-free space for me. Most of the time I am alone with the cats, and only sometimes am I joined by little kids. It is really wonderful, and I would recommend it to all of you. It is like a little break from the past. It is a place where I can be present in life without being in pain."}, "25_ptsd": {"id": "25_ptsd", "text": "Job drama causing flashbacks So I got in trouble at work today.

Hi everyone,\n\nI've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. \n\nI developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all.
