{"id": "1939_ptsd", "displayed_text": "OD PTSD Sorry long story of overdose ..  I need some advice about something I exeprienced in which I cant really find anything similar to my personal account of seeing someone overdose elswhere online to try and get some answers, other perspectives...\nalthough im still on the younger side, i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse just everything in which i am grateful for because it has made me very tough and able to relate with others.. i was dead sure i could handle anything but this . this has turned my world upside downn. it happened last july and i am much better mentally now but i still struggle with ptsd and triggers... i met this kid wonderful heart but misguided (not an addict)  and still has that feeling of invincibility..anyways we were in my room and the first incident we were on my bed and he was holding himself up on top of me kissing me and then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless . ill admit my first reaction was wrong, i was scared, and didnt realize his breathing and heart were stopping i was just shaking him yelling his name.. luckily he popped up and was like what happened wherr am i.. but quickly fell back into his high .. i knew from there something wasnt right so i was on high alert  (he had apparently taken stuff before he got to my house that i was guessing but wasnt sure).. after that he  snorted one in front of me i begged him to stop but he wouldnt and i couldnt force him to stop in that mindset he had . he then went in to use my bathroom (separate toilet room from shower area) and i was like okay ill just keep calling his name to make sure hes okay.. ( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right\u00bf but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone \"stops breathing\" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn ..", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 292, "end": 342, "span": "i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2656, "span": " just the vision of him basically dead in my arms..", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 38s "}}
{"id": "2155_ptsd", "displayed_text": "*tw: sexual assault* my story, and a few questions **Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault**\n\nokay so this is gonna sound weird so i'll start from the beginning\n\nSo, it started two years ago when I met a girl we'll call Jamie. So Jamie and I had a lot in common, and immediately became friends. I was new in town and she was my first friend.\n\nThe trouble started a year later, (I was 12 at this point, yup I know I'm young) when she started making some horrible comments. For example I told her I was bullied at my last school and she smirked and said \"Oh, so you're an easy target\" It felt weird, I wasn't sure how to react.\n\nLater, when school started again, she kept making comments like those or about my body. I definitely was an early bloomer and she was as well, but she really bugged me about some things about myself.\n\nThen, she molested me. Several times.\n\nAt first it was subtle touches, and she told me she was just physical with friends. I thought it was weird because she wasn't that way with other people.\n\nThen it got worse, like a lot worse. Not rape, but intense making out etc.\n\nSo that happened at the end of the school year and I didn't see her over the summer.\n\nIt was the worse summer of my life, and when school started I was extremely suicidal. At this point, I told a close friend. They helped me a lot.\n\nJamie took it way too far a few days ago. I'm shaken over it. I just want to get her out of my life.\n\nJamie is still abusing me.\n\nBut here's my problem. I want to report Jamie, I really do. But I feel like I can't for two main reasons\n\n1. She's popular at my small school, everyone knows her. It's a private school, so everyone knows each other anyways but she seems like such a nice person on the outside.\n2. I don't want to go to a hospital/inpaitient. I'm terrified of that.\n\nPlease, if someone knows what I can do say something.

{"id": "114_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Meet the criteria for PTSD, but feel like what I experienced shouldn\u2019t cause this much stress. I\u2019m a 22 year old female. My mom has always had significant health issues and will likely die of her diseases, although when is not clear. This is something that causes me a lot of grief and distress but I have gotten good at compartmentalizing. \n\nA few months ago, we learned she had a heart murmur, most likely due to a heart condition that would require surgery. At the time I worked a stressful job and had been backstabbed by my company. (80 hour work weeks, lying boss.) he wouldn\u2019t give me time off to care for her so I quit. Then we learned it was a mitral valve prolapse, and she definitely needed surgery. \n\nMy mom has a personality disorder and has emotionally abused me at times throughout my life, especially when she\u2019s stressed. So during this time she ostracized and bullied me, and banned me from going to the hospital for her surgery. \n\nIn this time she kicked me out for 2 weeks. I stayed with two shitty people who did shitty things. I also got a horrible stomach virus (we all did) and got to a point where I thought I may need to get IV fluids. I have health anxiety so this was really hard for me. I ended up coming back after those 2 weeks. \n\nI got updates from my dad while she was hospitalized, there were a couple times it was touch and go and they thought it might be time to say goodbye, but she pulled through. Every night I was scared to sleep for fear that she would be dead when I woke up. Gradually I began eating and sleeping less, until one day, a couple weeks or so after her surgery, I didn\u2019t eat or sleep for 3 days. Two doses of Ativan in the ER made no effect. I had a psychotic episode (I\u2019m assuming?) that I don\u2019t remember in which I physically fought the nurses and cussed out my friend. They gave me haloperidol and knocked me out. \n\nI was put in psych for 3 days in a terrible psych hospital where I received no therapy. The MD met with me once and said I have PTSD, but he thinks it\u2019s from an experience I had as a teenager. \n\nBackstory on that: my freshman year of high school, I pissed a girl off and she and her friends cornered me and tried to beat me up. I don\u2019t remember much of it, the adrenaline was in overdrive. The only mark on my body was a bleeding cut above my eye from being thrown onto a table. \n\nIt was about 6 months after that that I began having constant panic attacks. Anxiety and depression deeply colored the next 4 years, as did benzo addiction. \n\nHowever, I never felt fear when I recalled the event. I had no flashbacks or nightmares. I didn\u2019t avoid any reminders of the event. Basically, I didn\u2019t fit any PTSD criteria, except the anxiety and hyper vigilance. \n\nNow, I fit the criteria for it. \n\nI avoid reminders of that time period from the time my mom kicked me out until I got out of the psych ward. \nI won\u2019t watch tv because that\u2019s all I did (unless I\u2019m with someone) \nMy house gives me anxiety because it reminds me of being there alone and afraid. \nI am terrified to sleep alone- I\u2019ve only slept alone in my bed a handful of times since then and it\u2019s always so scary to me that I cry if I have to do it. \nI feel empty and like my life will never get better, I can\u2019t see a future. \nWhen I\u2019m alone I am very afraid. \nI have a loss of identity. \nI feel disconnected to most people. \nI have panic attacks almost daily. \nI struggle to feel emotion, and when I do, I\u2019m either sobbing or wanting to die or hurt myself, I imagine stabbing myself or slitting my wrists to satisfy the urge. \n\nAll the psychiatrists I\u2019ve called are booked out 6 months.
