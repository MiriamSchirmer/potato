{"id": "1016_ptsd", "displayed_text": "From ok to 0 in about 2 seconds I have a bunch of traumatic things that have happened to me while I was growing up (sexual abuse from family members, a long-term emotionally abusive relationship that has thankfully ended, and continually high pressure from my family to perform and has been very verbally abusive).\n\nPreviously I\u2019ve been able to cope extremely well and sort of swept all of this under the rug. I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life\u2019s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.\n\n2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I\u2019m seeing therapists but they haven\u2019t put down a diagnosis yet) as I\u2019m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I\u2019ve had to stop work for the moment because I can\u2019t cope.\n\nI am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner\u2019s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.\n\nIt\u2019s father\u2019s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven\u2019t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it\u2019s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don\u2019t resolve any issues. And it\u2019s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn\u2019t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it\u2019s taken a full toll on me.\n\nThe relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn\u2019t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father\u2019s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad\u2019s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn\u2019t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I\u2019m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I\u2019m terrified about my future and whether I\u2019ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I\u2019m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn\u2019t that good to start with. My parents don\u2019t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).\n\nRight now I don\u2019t feel safe and I don\u2019t know what to do.

She told me this early on in our relationship but it has never been mentioned since. \n\n\nBut I feel that it is still affecting her everyday life in a very significant way. She doesn\u2019t sleep from\nnightmares, she\u2019s hyper vigilant at all times, often descends into the deepest sadness for days at a time, says the most awful things about herself, she gets faint, sometimes disassociated or shuts down completely, and is so incredibly anxious most of the time. She just isn\u2019t happy or enjoying her life at all. I have in the past gently suggested that she talk to a therapist, not with direct reference to C-PTSD but because she has told me she wants to die, or because of self harm, and this is met with quite a lot of hostility, saying that I thought she was crazy or just shifting my responsibility as a boyfriend on to a therapist, and it has almost lead to break-ups, so I haven\u2019t suggested it in a while.\n\n\nAnother part of it is that within our relationship when I have made mistakes, nothing that I felt was too major - getting a bit cross, or being late to a meet up, it\u2019s been world shattering for her, sent her spiralling down for days. She told me that sometimes she almost cries when she sees me because of the relief and safety it makes her feel. I was so touched that she felt that way but it also made me realise the responsibility I have, how careful I need to be to not make any slip-ups, and why she finds it so hard to forgive little things - if they\u2019ve made her feel this awful I don\u2019t really blame her. And it also made me realise that I actually never talk about how I\u2019m feeling or if I\u2019m upset, because of fear of upsetting her. There have been times when I\u2019ve felt more like a carer than a boyfriend, I feel awful for saying that but it is how it\u2019s felt. It is beginning to really affect me too and I don\u2019t feel that that is sustainable in a relationship. \n\n\nI think that I need to encourage her to seek help,  but to be more upfront and talk about the C-PTSD and how I see her feeling, and to say that I don\u2019t think things can continue with the way they currently are, with her whole world being dependent on me. Because I\u2019ll inevitably slip up from time to time with little things as people do, and I don\u2019t want her to have to feel so so sad when I do. But I do want to be with her, I love her and I want most for her to be happy. But I know that me suggesting this will not go down well. She doesn\u2019t see the symptoms I mentioned as anything more than just situational - she doesn\u2019t like work or she\u2019s just tired. But while the situations have always changed the feelings haven\u2019t. \n\n\nWhat I was hoping was if anyone with more experience of the condition might be able to make clearer is whether I am doing the right thing by suggesting getting help, and if so whether there are specific things I should avoid saying that could make the CPTSD worse, or if there\u2019s a best way to go about it. I don\u2019t want to bring up her old trauma with her anymore than I need to, I really don\u2019t want to upset her with this, but I just don\u2019t feel things are sustainable as they currently are.

{"id": "2193_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Was in a traumatic car accident last week I don't know what I'm trying to gain from posting this, I think I just need to talk about it. Maybe hear similar stories. I've been trying to not talk about it too much to my friends and family because it was traumatic for them, too, and I'm sure they're sick of hearing about it. I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I know it's gonna be long. I apologize in advance. \nI was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically. \nMy mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us. He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake. I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react. \nHis mini van hits us right on my door. I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state. \nIt happened exactly like it does in the movies. In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself. I expected the car to just stop. I keep replaying that moment in my head. Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window. The window shatters on me, the airbag goes off, my door caves in on me. Everything goes red then a pale orange. \nOur car spins what feels like a million times and when we stop everything smells like smoke. I hear screaming and it takes me a while to realize it's me screaming. My mom gets out before I even realize we've stopped moving. I can't get out, my door is caved in. I feel like the car is going to explode and I can't do anything. I'm sure that I'm going to be set on fire. My whole face feels wet and I notice blood dripping onto my jacket. I can't open my right eye. Maybe I was just too scared. I don't know. My mom pulls me out of the car from the drivers side. \nFrom the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming. One woman, who I later learned had medical training of some sort, got a clean towel from her house and put it over my eye. Her daughter was on the phone with 911. She was trying to help me breathe but I was hysterical. I ask if everyone in the other car is okay. She says they're all okay, I'm the only one bleeding. \nAt the hospital, they take two pieces of glass out of my eye, right below my eyebrow. By some miracle, all I have is a concussion, the stitches from the glass above my eye, lots of bruising and some cuts from the glass. I'm gonna be out of work for 1-2 weeks. The general consensus is that I'm very lucky I didn't die. I have lost about 6 of my old classmates to car accidents alone this year. \nOn one hand, I do feel lucky. I should've been in worse shape. On the other hand, to be honest, most days I wake up, I wished it killed me. I feel like I'm trapped in my own life now. Being in cars now is suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box underwater. Loud noises, the smell of smoke, seeing headlights, walking too close to the road, the sound of car horns. Fireworks. Doors closing too hard. Everything scares me. The drives to my doctors appointments are excruciating. I think about what it might've been like if I just died. \nI feel completely out of control of everything. I obsess over everything I can't control now. Natural disasters, house fires, accidents of any kind. I don't want anyone to leave my sight because if I can't see them in front of me, then I don't know they're safe. It feels so unfair this guy just got to rip away my peace of mind. I've become so preoccupied with control. What I can control, what I can't control, what others around me can control. \nI have PTSD already, from childhood abuse and a sexual assault that happened two years ago. I also have OCD which is probably responsible for my new obsessive thoughts. \nMaybe it's dramatic. My injuries are minor compared to what could've happened. But I feel completely broken. I want to stay positive but I'm really struggling with the idea of this being my reality forever.

{"id": "1789_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Everything but PTSD Up until my diagnosis this year, I had no idea why I was the way I was. There exists only four years of my 30 year life not touched by trauma. \n\nA list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.\n\nExtreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.\n\n\nFainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I\u2019m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children\u2019s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)\n\n\nInsomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn\u2019t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. \n\n\nVivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it\u2019s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. \n\n\nSocial Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn\u2019t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)\n\n\nDepression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I\u2019m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn\u2019t make me sad or upset, it\u2019s not like I wanted those things because I don\u2019t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn\u2019t close to my dad but wasn\u2019t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn\u2019t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn\u2019t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)\n\n\nIrregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I\u2019m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)\n\n\nConcentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) \n\n\nA few other things I experienced but I don\u2019t feel like going into:\nEating disorders\nAlcohol and drug abuse \nPromiscuity \n\n\nAll of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I\u2019m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. \n\n\nJust now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 278, "end": 485, "span": "Extreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 822, "end": 903, "span": "I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2877, "span": "Heart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23.
