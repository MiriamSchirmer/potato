And nothing terrifies you more than wondering how long it will take for there to just be one voice left? \n\nEverything in my world, every person, every event, every action, every idea, every desire, can only say one of two things: 'Give up,' or 'Keep trying'. Problem is, it's harder and harder to hear hope. Every decision I make it either to give up or keep trying. Every single one. It's not a decision of whether to go to work or stay home; it's a question of whether I'm giving up today. I never have to decide whether I'm going to do the laundry or not; I have to choose whether to keep trying or not. \n\nOf course, it's not quite that simple, is it? Because every choice has a cost, and that cost is pain. Sometimes trying hurts more. Sometimes giving up hurts more. But it always hurts to know that there's no sense or order to it at all. No matter what I choose, it will hurt. I'll be more tired tomorrow than I was today, it will be more difficult the day after that. So why 'keep trying'? It's a question I have to 'keep trying' to answer, isn't it? Because trying or giving up is not ultimately a question of survival, but of sacrifice. \n\nSuffering is worst when it is meaningless. A man can absorb a universe of pain for a noble purpose, but a prick of senseless suffering can bring him to his knees. At least it's true for me. Perhaps it's an inherent weakness. Perhaps it's a failure of character. Does it matter? I suspect it might have, once, but now that pain has scoured so much of me away I have my doubts. What difference would it make if I was alive or dead? \n\nOf course, the truth is, death would be an immeasurable improvement for me. But in the depths of my soul I know that my life has never been about me. In fact, that barest shred of self-forgetfulness, of selflessness, is the only thing keeping me alive. I wish it was because I was primarily motivated by my care for others, of how devastating my selfish death would be to them, but I suspect it's not. Brutally and truthfully, to deny the reality of my derivative and dependent existence would be to obliterate the last anchor-hold of meaning to life at all. There's little sense in wading through the philosophical underpinnings of the conviction, but there it is all the same. If life is about me, it must be meaningless. If life has never been about me, it is because an objective purpose exists that, by its weight and significance, orients all lives toward itself. \n\nMy pain has banished me into darkness, blinded by suffering to the noonbright hope and meaning that lights my way unseen. But I am not the gravest thing in my universe; hope has far more gravity than I, and my world is trapped in its orbit, however much I stumble and crawl in my blindness. \n\nI wonder if anyone knows how it feels to feel life screaming at you to GIVE UP at every turn. Every voice. Every person. Every interaction. Every hurt. Every pleasure. Every failure. Every season. Give up. \n\nDemons can give voice to things, you know. Quiet, innocuous things take on a beastly aspect. Snarling, sniveling, malicious, monstrous lies, though obvious for their fiendish nature, can be bound up in so much rage and sinew that their roar drowns out their foulness. Familiarity is, after all, just another form of blindness. A man can see a lie for what it is the first time he sees it. 'Give up.' He recoils in disgust at the squirming, grimy thing, and wishes that someone would stamp it out. But if all his world becomes crowded with lies, if they squeeze out of holes in the ground and pile up, growing larger, feeding on pain and fear, until they blot out the son and tower over him with claws and horns, smiling wickedly--well, he must go on about his business. Everyone expects him to, anyway. Perhaps the devils aren't really there. No one else seems to notice them, anyway. But try as he might, he cannot ignore them forever. They fade into the background. They become part of his world, part of the canvas instead of the painting. Nuisances long ignored become companions in time. But the screaming. Oh, the howling of hell that can be heard so loud by the soul of one man yet be silent to all others. The loneliness of it all is enough to drive a person mad. \n\nYou're not supposed to give credit to devils, after all. Focus on the positive, they say. It's not the darkness but the light that will triumph, in the end, so is it not as if the darkness was never there at all? It has no power to drive out or drive back its nemesis; so hope, dear boy! Carry your light and live not in fear of the legions that assail you day and night, but especially the night. \n\nBut they never tell you how naked you are in your dreams. How I wish that angels would visit me instead of demons. Words can't describe what it's like to have nightmares for four years straight. Devils can make you dream about anything they like. Frightful nights once in a long while can only trouble young children. But when demons invade the solace of sleep, it's like your enemy taking up residence in your home. They just wait for you to come home; you can't stay away forever. You can't stay awake forever. There's no refuge from that kind of torment. The more your sleep suffers, the more you need it, the more you suffer. I never expected to understand so well why people kill themselves.", "displayed_text": "Just shouting into the void Do you know what it's like for someone to ask about your summer plans, and for your first thought to be, 'I don't even know if I'll be alive by summer.'?\n\nDo you know what it's like for all the noise in the world to boil down to just two voices? And nothing terrifies you more than wondering how long it will take for there to just be one voice left? \n\nEverything in my world, every person, every event, every action, every idea, every desire, can only say one of two things: 'Give up,' or 'Keep trying'. Problem is, it's harder and harder to hear hope. Every decision I make it either to give up or keep trying. Every single one. It's not a decision of whether to go to work or stay home; it's a question of whether I'm giving up today. I never have to decide whether I'm going to do the laundry or not; I have to choose whether to keep trying or not. \n\nOf course, it's not quite that simple, is it? Because every choice has a cost, and that cost is pain. Sometimes trying hurts more. Sometimes giving up hurts more. But it always hurts to know that there's no sense or order to it at all. No matter what I choose, it will hurt. I'll be more tired tomorrow than I was today, it will be more difficult the day after that. So why 'keep trying'? It's a question I have to 'keep trying' to answer, isn't it? Because trying or giving up is not ultimately a question of survival, but of sacrifice. \n\nSuffering is worst when it is meaningless. A man can absorb a universe of pain for a noble purpose, but a prick of senseless suffering can bring him to his knees. At least it's true for me. Perhaps it's an inherent weakness. Perhaps it's a failure of character. Does it matter? I suspect it might have, once, but now that pain has scoured so much of me away I have my doubts. What difference would it make if I was alive or dead? \n\nOf course, the truth is, death would be an immeasurable improvement for me. But in the depths of my soul I know that my life has never been about me. In fact, that barest shred of self-forgetfulness, of selflessness, is the only thing keeping me alive.

I recently came to understand indirectly that my closest friend might be experiencing some symptoms of PTSD for a trauma that might not have seen any resolution. They're a very private person in general and I understand why they would not have wanted to disclose what they did. But their coping mechanisms had gotten pretty disruptive to our friendship, so I found myself asking after what was up and accidentally put them in a position of having to disclose some details to me in order to answer all my questions.\n\nWhile they have never mentioned PTSD specifically, it seems like a strong possibility to me as an outsider. My other best friend has talked with me in depth about his own experiences with PTSD, so perhaps the thought started there in my mind. I don't want to pretend I'm diagnosing her, but I am looking to suggest therapy in general without being insensitive or trigger them by accident.\n\nThey cited extreme dissociation and emotional numbness and specific flashbacks as things interfering with our friendship and their life right now, and while I recognize that I shouldn't and will not come in to their space claiming to know how to do best for them, based on what they mentioned as their plan to deal with this ongoing stress, I am very concerned that they're entirely avoiding the possibility of professional therapy.\n\nEven if they do numb the negative emotions after the next few months of cutting themself off from others for a bit, I'm worried that that could mean there will still be a lack of healthier mechanisms in place.\n\nI definitely don't want to come off to them like I'm digging into their past. This is their fight in the end, but this person is very dear to me. I stated when I first found out that I would be there for them if they needed me, of course, but I know they're not in a place to reach out actively to me.

I recently came to understand indirectly that my closest friend might be experiencing some symptoms of PTSD for a trauma that might not have seen any resolution. They're a very private person in general and I understand why they would not have wanted to disclose what they did. But their coping mechanisms had gotten pretty disruptive to our friendship, so I found myself asking after what was up and accidentally put them in a position of having to disclose some details to me in order to answer all my questions.\n\nWhile they have never mentioned PTSD specifically, it seems like a strong possibility to me as an outsider. My other best friend has talked with me in depth about his own experiences with PTSD, so perhaps the thought started there in my mind. I don't want to pretend I'm diagnosing her, but I am looking to suggest therapy in general without being insensitive or trigger them by accident.\n\nThey cited extreme dissociation and emotional numbness and specific flashbacks as things interfering with our friendship and their life right now, and while I recognize that I shouldn't and will not come in to their space claiming to know how to do best for them, based on what they mentioned as their plan to deal with this ongoing stress, I am very concerned that they're entirely avoiding the possibility of professional therapy.\n\nEven if they do numb the negative emotions after the next few months of cutting themself off from others for a bit, I'm worried that that could mean there will still be a lack of healthier mechanisms in place.\n\nI definitely don't want to come off to them like I'm digging into their past. This is their fight in the end, but this person is very dear to me. I stated when I first found out that I would be there for them if they needed me, of course, but I know they're not in a place to reach out actively to me.

I couldn\u2019t shake this feeling of just feeling yucky and gross and used and ashamed and embarrassed.  I kept thinking why did he say that? He\u2019s supposed to be my friend, why did he make it weird? I kinda just wanna curl into a ball and cry and I don\u2019t know why. Like it\u2019s not a big deal but maybe if I had done something differently he wouldn\u2019t have said that? I just can\u2019t get over it and I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I\u2019m just overreacting. But it\u2019s really made me feel awful and confused. \n\nThanks for listening."}, "36_ptsd": {"id": "36_ptsd", "text": "Boyfriend is REALLY angry over flashbacks and panic attack Im sorry this is probably barely going to be ebglish because I really cant tell what's real or not right now\n\nIt's been months since ive had any flashbacks but he knows about my triggers and getting angry when i'm too tired/sick for sex is basically #1 and he got really upset when i  ouldnt provide tonight and i tried to wrap myself in a blanket and go to a dark room and snuggle my dog but he just got SO ANGRY about that and now is telling me i have to leave because i cant handle the relationship\n\nI called the suicide prevention hotline but they couldnt understand a word i was saying over the sobbing i can't stop right now because all i can see is flashback\n\nHe has ptsd from his childhood i thoight he inderstood things like this but he says i'm pushing him away and this relationship is all i have, he's my full time caregiver i cant just leave like he says", "displayed_text": "Boyfriend is REALLY angry over flashbacks and panic attack Im sorry this is probably barely going to be ebglish because I really cant tell what's real or not right now\n\nIt's been months since ive had any flashbacks but he knows about my triggers and getting angry when i'm too tired/sick for sex is basically #1 and he got really upset when i  ouldnt provide tonight and i tried to wrap myself in a blanket and go to a dark room and snuggle my dog but he just got SO ANGRY about that and now is telling me i have to leave because i cant handle the relationship\n\nI called the suicide prevention hotline but they couldnt understand a word i was saying over the sobbing i can't stop right now because all i can see is flashback\n\nHe has ptsd from his childhood i thoight he inderstood things like this but he says i'm pushing him away and this relationship is all i have, he's my full time caregiver i cant just leave like he says"}, "87_counseling": {"id": "87_counseling", "text": "You as the child in the middle of your parents' problems is the worse position to be in.\u00a0 I can only imagine your hurt, pain and confusion on what to do.\u00a0 Honestly, this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age, your parents' ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the end.\u00a0 One thing I would like to note....your parents may be in the same house but if your mother is cheating, they have already gone their separate ways.\u00a0 ", "displayed_text": "You as the child in the middle of your parents' problems is the worse position to be in.\u00a0 I can only imagine your hurt, pain and confusion on what to do.\u00a0 Honestly, this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age, your parents' ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the end.\u00a0 One thing I would like to note....your parents may be in the same house but if your mother is cheating, they have already gone their separate ways.\u00a0 "}, "97_incel": {"id": "97_incel", "text": "Last year, I saw a news report on our regional TV channel.
