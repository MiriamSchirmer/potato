How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential.  For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint. I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing.

I hope some well agree disagree and some will give me more advice then what I have. One thing I learned from my mindset is to stop or to never engage in the victim mindset. Meaning what is done is done, dwell on it for a few I agree your a human being.  but to fond and to idolize what was done or what happened has been always a no no.  I learned that I couldn\u2019t control people or their actions I was a kid but I couldn\u2019t control people. It\u2019s not your fault don\u2019t blame yourself.( I can sit here and say what happened but I\u2019m not.) because one it\u2019s done with nothing can honestly change it, and 2 the goal with this is to idolize yourself and to help you get on the Road of recovery.\nVices, Pride and Ego\n All these things cooked me. It\u2019s not a weak thing or weak to ask for help  it\u2019s actually a great thing.

The world is big it\u2019s not small it feel small when you trap yourself in a cycle of negative thoughts. It was uncomfortable I agree at first and I failed at times but i got the second time coming.  \nFailures:\nAt times you will fail like every human being does but when you have ptsd it feels like the end of the world like relax man it\u2019s not.

Because I saw and felt what it does to you, at times of conflict or out of randomness it occurs.

It\u2019s okay I always tell myself and it is true I am okay I have no medical illness or diseases. \n \nMy mindset has always helped me and I hope by telling you the reddit community. I hope some well agree disagree and some will give me more advice then what I have. One thing I learned from my mindset is to stop or to never engage in the victim mindset. Meaning what is done is done, dwell on it for a few I agree your a human being.  but to fond and to idolize what was done or what happened has been always a no no.  I learned that I couldn\u2019t control people or their actions I was a kid but I couldn\u2019t control people. It\u2019s not your fault don\u2019t blame yourself.( I can sit here and say what happened but I\u2019m not.) because one it\u2019s done with nothing can honestly change it, and 2 the goal with this is to idolize yourself and to help you get on the Road of recovery.\nVices, Pride and Ego\n All these things cooked me. It\u2019s not a weak thing or weak to ask for help  it\u2019s actually a great thing.
