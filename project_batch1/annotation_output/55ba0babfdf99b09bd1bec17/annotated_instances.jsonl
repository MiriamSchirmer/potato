But I don't seem to be able to carry all of it and sometimes it comes crashing down at me. I end up crying and downwards spiraling in my thoughts. I have trouble remembering stuff, I have trouble concentrating and it doesn't feel like I will ever get to where I want to be. I'm afraid, scared and it seems that I have gotten used to the feeling of it that I don't even notice anymore. My head is failing me and it was one of my best qualities about myself.  \n\n\nI grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too. We were poor, there never was a ray of sunshine because new clouds of shit always came around.   \n\n\nMy earliest memories is me running from home, because my mother yelled at me to do so - because my dad was going to beat her. She told me to run to my aunt and make her call the police. I remember running, but not arriving there.  \n\n\nI became the quiet kid, the kid that tried to fix everything and not cause any trouble. But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  \nI had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either. I remember being in school, and people were complaining about things that seemed like nothing but I never could tell anyone.  \n\n\nI remember feeling so horribly sad, and I went to talk with my mother. And she was high on the pills, because she said she saw angels but it was just light flashes from the cars driving by our window. And that hurt so much.  \nI was crying and she didin't take care of me.   \n\n\nWhen I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother. Everytime they came around, they always brought problems home. Always turned to a scream-fest and me being stuck infront of my PC - hoping that they don't come here.  \n\n\nI never got beaten by my dad, but my dad beat everyone else. ( I can't remember how severe it was, but I don't think that anyone got hospitalized. ) And my mom told me that I should feel glad/lucky that he never did, because I was his son.  \n\n\nI finally got to meet a therapist, I cried and did what I thought was nessecary to get past this.  \nBut it won't let me go, I just want to be healthy and be a normal person. I want to stop crying everyday, I want to feel good enough and not being so fucking pitiful. I was so strong, I thought.  \n\n\nThen I tried cannabis, and I realised that not all drugs are bad and.. It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.  \n\n\nThen.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze. I took some punches, told the truth and they wanted to beat someone else now.  \n (But it backfired in two hours and they wanted to meet me and prob beat me more.)  \n\n\nWhen I left, I was glad that I had not pissed myself or started crying. But my head was racing, I had never been so alert in my life. Adrenaline.  \nI did not realise that.. That was probarly the beginning of my PTSD. I became paranoid, I moved 2 days after that.  \n\n\n7 months later, I was in the military. I was not forced, but I thought it was a good idea and a nice life experience.  \n2,5-3 months in, it hit me. I started flinching, I started dreaming nightmares, I became dull in my head, I once grappled with a dude and.. I became so furious, and he had to hold me because, if he had let me go earlier than he did. I maybe would have done something rash. ( I can get angry, but I -never- act on it.. I did when I was a teen, but very rarely. )  \n\n\nI had to drop out, I felt that I was a failure. I came back to my country where I was born. (Neighbour country.)  \nI started living with my GF and.. That is where everything turned to shit.  \n\n\nI have stopped crying while writing, so that's nice. But I must have been occupied.. Less than a hour, but more than 20 minutes.   \n\n\nI have forgot to mention so much. Such as, I stopped being happy after the military. My symptoms worsened.  \nI did not know what was wrong with me back then, now I do.  \nIt felt like I was at fault, but I know now that it's just a illness or whatever you may call it.   \n(English is not my primary language.)\n\n  \nI'm going to talk to a therapist again, I'm waiting for a call. (Within 10 days.)  \nI try to be transparent how I feel with my GF but it's hard and sometimes I want to just fight it through without her help, because I don't want to take even more from her than she already gives me.\n\n  \nI found this sub yesterday, I was looking for a place to ventilate. I can't keep crashing and crying infront of my awesome girlfriend, I -must- get better because I don't want to lose her. (She really is the best, my gf during military cheated twice. Nice.) Anyhow, I read a post and.. The person writing felt the same way I did, I could see myself in several other posts, people who have it better or worse. And I felt glad, that I'm not crazy and you people also feel like I do.  \nI know, it's f\\*\\*ked up but thank you for feeling like this and thank you for sharing!", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2305, "end": 3285, "span": "nd that hurt so much.  \r\nI was crying and she didin't take care of me.   \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother.

Saw the judge, explained why I left and let him know I\u2019m ready to do whatever it takes to get this out of the way of my life.  \nIt went well, but I have two other counties to appear at in the near future.  Everything went better than expected. \nSince we came back home It\u2019s like a switch was flipped and everything feels out of control.  I don\u2019t feel safe anymore.  I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and I\u2019m having a really hard time coping with the reality that I\u2019ll probably be locked in a cage again at some point. I found myself curled up at the foot of my bed yesterday crying with my entire body convulsing as I remembered very specific events that have taken place over the last 10 years.  \nI can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t handle my daughter when she cries, I keep flipping out in anger over the smallest triggers.  (Wife burned her hand on a hot plate, screamed in pain, and I flipped out.  Yelling at her and had to leave the house for a walk to cool down.). \nAnyway I\u2019m wondering what I can do to stop myself from emotionally hurting the people I love during this time.  I\u2019m not violent, never physically hurt anyone, but I\u2019m so afraid of ruining the life I\u2019ve built while I learn how to process all of this and move forward.  It\u2019s so strange to me because right now I\u2019m totally fine.  I can think of all the worst memories or possible outcomes and be totally willing to go through it, but my episodes have been triggered so quickly and randomly that I don\u2019t see how I can stop myself in the moment.   \nIs it normal to be able to recall memories and be fine with it one day, and then have a completely insane reaction throughout my entire body over the same thoughts another day?   \nAgain, I\u2019m not worried that I\u2019m going to do any physical damage to anybody, I just don\u2019t want my family to see me like this and remember it for the rest of our lives together.  I don\u2019t want to scare them or cause their own traumas and issues in life because of my inability to rationalize this.  \nI have my first emdr session coming up on Thursday and I\u2019m going back to work in the morning so I think that will help.

Her foster family didn't care for her either. She never had a safe childhood. i knew she was a little off when we first met, but it only started to get worse.

I have a great deal of trauma attached to my birth name which I no longer use and they put very little effort into understanding this and not using it when talking to or about me. I also have trauma associated with my upbringing and my family's behaviour to me as a child.\n\nThe conversations were over email and it felt as if they had begun to be more understanding of this. Recently my Mother came to visit me and after about an hour into her being here, I noticed I had begun to feel extremely nauseous, very anxious and uncomfortable, to the point where I really struggled to focus and maintain socialising for the rest of the day and for the rest of her visit. I had a really hard time falling asleep because these feelings did not subside and instead had gotten worse, leaving me up overthinking to the point of crying and feeling like I needed to throw up as if I had something stuck in my throat.\n\nEven though they have not purposefully me any wrongdoing and that I still love them as family, I feel as if I would be putting myself through more than it is worth and more than I can deal with if I continued keeping in contact with them. I feel great deals of guilt when considering cutting them out of my life but I honestly don't know if there is a better option at this point other than doing this and seeing a therapist.\n\nPeople say that you are meant to remove from your life things that are triggering for past trauma, but what do you do when this trigger is a person, especially a family member or members?\n\nI am really stuck here, sometimes I feel as if I am being over sensitive and nasty about this, but other times I feel justified and this is the right thing to do for myself.
