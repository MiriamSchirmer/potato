I had to keep going through the motions.  It\u2019s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.\n\nWhat used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I\u2019ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven\u2019t done that since 06\u2019. \n\nAm I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That\u2019s still there right now.  But I\u2019m up.  \n\nI\u2019m doing choirs.  I\u2019m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it\u2019s been since I can remember.\n\nI\u2019ve read over what I\u2019ve written for about 20 min.    \n\nI guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:\n\nI still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I\u2019ll never be \u201cOk\u201d\n\nBUT\n\nThe pit is less deep and it\u2019s easier to climb out. \n\n\n\n"}, "151_counseling": {"id": "151_counseling", "text": "My partner lives in Canada while I live in the US.

It felt like he was on top of me for hours but I'm guessing it was more like 15 or 20 minutes. Nothing more happened, he got off me and fell asleep somewhere in the apartment, but it left me anxious and depressed for months.  I felt dirty and guilty. I couldn't look men in the eyes and any romantic attention from men felt even more threatening than it did for me already, even if I knew that they were probably very nice guys. Because of this I have never had a boyfriend. Never slept with a man. The first and last time I had sexual contact with a man was when I woke up to someone who I thought I could trust sucking on my neck and putting his hand under my blanket. I am nearly 25 now. Its embarrassing to me and I am afraid that, at this point, if I manage to move past the anxiety of male attention that I will scare away any man with my lack of experience.\n\nThat was the first one. The second event, which blew everything up, was when I was jumped walking home at night. I am a runner and a lot stronger than I look as a small woman and managed to get away. It left me so traumatized, though, because I tried really hard to get help and no one would help me. The security guard at my apartment building told me to stop talking and tell the female security guard who was only going to be working 4 days later, and the police laughed at me when I described what happened. (Might sound unlikely but I was living in another country at this time and this isnt uncommon behavior there).\n\nAt this point I would physically start to shake if I was hanging out with a man and he got touchy. Panic attack symptoms minus hyperventilation. \nI would feel my body go cold and my muscles seize up. There was a situation when I was trying to get over this all and had been on a few dates with a guy. He kissed me and all was fine until he touched my thigh and I started having a panic attack. I was so embarrassed and humiliated because he immediately left the room to tell him roommates. Yes, I know, I found myself an asshole.\n\nThat left me with really unhealthy views of men (even more than before) and I genuinely believed for a very long time that men did not feel love and that any appearance of love was purely a form of manipulation. These experiences along with an unfortunate mother (who would tell me things like \"all men cheat\") caused me to be so scared to fall in love because to me that would mean being a slave.

I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7\" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2\" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.\n\nFast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  \n\nAnother episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.\n\nI know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.\n\nSorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.\n\n**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**\n\n\n", "displayed_text": "I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**\n\n\n\n**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.

To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  \n\nAnother episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.\n\nI know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.\n\nSorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.\n\n**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**\n\n\n"}, "277_counseling": {"id": "277_counseling", "text": "I'm sorry for what sounds like a frustrating situation.For how long has your daughter lived the way you describe and did it start all of a sudden or more gradually come on?What you write sounds like a major depressive disorder and this can start for a variety of reasons and improve in just as many different ways.Start with how you are feeling about the situation. \u00a0Ask yourself for how long you will be able to tolerate the way your daughter lives and if you feel any satisfaction in your mother daughter relationship.If she is of legal age, and you don't want her to live with you, \u00a0you've tried convincing her to get medical care for its own sake and to more clearly see her emotional and psychological health, and she is unwilling to take care of herself, you can discuss your options with the adult protective services agency in your state.The first step is to know what exactly is her problem so you can decide if its own you are willing to take care of or not.", "displayed_text": "I'm sorry for what sounds like a frustrating situation.For how long has your daughter lived the way you describe and did it start all of a sudden or more gradually come on?What you write sounds like a major depressive disorder and this can start for a variety of reasons and improve in just as many different ways.Start with how you are feeling about the situation. \u00a0Ask yourself for how long you will be able to tolerate the way your daughter lives and if you feel any satisfaction in your mother daughter relationship.If she is of legal age, and you don't want her to live with you, \u00a0you've tried convincing her to get medical care for its own sake and to more clearly see her emotional and psychological health, and she is unwilling to take care of herself, you can discuss your options with the adult protective services agency in your state.The first step is to know what exactly is her problem so you can decide if its own you are willing to take care of or not."}, "1328_ptsd": {"id": "1328_ptsd", "text": "Veterans and Anyone who needs support https://www.facebook.com/100004377877090/videos/917712418384679/\n\nWrote this song.

But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  \nI had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either.

It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.  \n\n\nThen.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze.

We've been together for just over a year now and he's amazing and so supportive, but I do still have some small issues.\n\nBut on Saturday, I was walking back from shopping in the town centre with my boyfriend, and I walked past him. He looks exactly the same as he did years ago, and I'm pretty sure he noticed me, and did that stupid hair flip that he always used to do. \n\nIt was so weird, I just grabbed my boyfriend and walked past very quickly. I told him a couple of minutes later and he hugged me and told me it was okay etc, but I just felt so stunned.\n\nI didn't really feel upset or anything, it was really strange, I'm still not sure what to think about it. \n\nHave you ever seen your abuser in public randomly?

It may not seem like those lies she told did much, but it was everyday and eventually it took a toll on my mental health. I'm now depressed, paranoid, I have anxiety, and PTSD. My sister got worse with how she treated me. She started physically fighting with me. If we got caught fighting she would fake cry and blame it on me. Our parents were the type to give spankings. I got those a lot, because of her. My parents always believed her because she's almost five years older than me. I remember the first time I tried to kill myself, it was after she got me in trouble one morning. I have this loose ceiling fan in my room. I was always a smart kid, but sometimes not in a good way. I was five, and I thought if I hang myself with my jump rope from my ceiling fan then if the jump rope breaks the fan will probably fall and kill me. My mom walked in the room and saw me tying a jump rope to my fan. She yelled at me and took the jump rope. I wasn't allowed near jump ropes for six years. Two months ago I had cut myself for the first time, because my sister lied again. I had flashbacks to all the other times she had hurt me in someway. I had a breakdown, and things have just been getting worse ever since. I've had the urge to cut again. Luckily I haven't, yet. I'm trapped in this house. I'm too young to leave, and my sister won't move out. I think I'm going to die here, so to everyone who reads this I want you to know what I've been wishing to have for a while now. I wish that I could have someone in the world to love. Not just someone who will show me they love me. I want to have someone that I can give all my love too. Someone I can hug, talk to, cook for, watch movies with, play videogames with, someone who I can be there for when ever they need me. I don't care about feeling loved, I want to make someone feel loved. Sadly I don't think that I'll ever get to do that. So to anyone who feels that they aren't loved, just know that if I could, I would be there for you. I'm sorry I can't be there, but just know that I care. I'll always care, even if I die. I won't stop trying to make my wish true even if it kills me in the process. I'll only be happy if I make someone else happy.
