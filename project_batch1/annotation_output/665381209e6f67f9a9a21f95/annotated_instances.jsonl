Hello everyone, as the title states - this is my first post here.   \n(I might have not done it right.)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-NSFW- PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE CAREFUL, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T READ THIS. -NSFW-  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI haven't got anywhere yet, and this is tough, just trying to ventilate something.  \n\n\nI'm in my early 20s, I'm a male, I live in Europe and I have a girlfriend that tries to support me.  \nI am struggling today with studies, my everyday mental state and doing what I think is required of me. But I don't seem to be able to carry all of it and sometimes it comes crashing down at me. I end up crying and downwards spiraling in my thoughts. I have trouble remembering stuff, I have trouble concentrating and it doesn't feel like I will ever get to where I want to be. I'm afraid, scared and it seems that I have gotten used to the feeling of it that I don't even notice anymore. My head is failing me and it was one of my best qualities about myself.  \n\n\nI grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too. We were poor, there never was a ray of sunshine because new clouds of shit always came around.   \n\n\nMy earliest memories is me running from home, because my mother yelled at me to do so - because my dad was going to beat her. She told me to run to my aunt and make her call the police. I remember running, but not arriving there.  \n\n\nI became the quiet kid, the kid that tried to fix everything and not cause any trouble. But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  \nI had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either. I remember being in school, and people were complaining about things that seemed like nothing but I never could tell anyone.  \n\n\nI remember feeling so horribly sad, and I went to talk with my mother. And she was high on the pills, because she said she saw angels but it was just light flashes from the cars driving by our window. And that hurt so much.  \nI was crying and she didin't take care of me.   \n\n\nWhen I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother. Everytime they came around, they always brought problems home. Always turned to a scream-fest and me being stuck infront of my PC - hoping that they don't come here.  \n\n\nI never got beaten by my dad, but my dad beat everyone else. ( I can't remember how severe it was, but I don't think that anyone got hospitalized. ) And my mom told me that I should feel glad/lucky that he never did, because I was his son.  \n\n\nI finally got to meet a therapist, I cried and did what I thought was nessecary to get past this.  \nBut it won't let me go, I just want to be healthy and be a normal person. I want to stop crying everyday, I want to feel good enough and not being so fucking pitiful. I was so strong, I thought.  \n\n\nThen I tried cannabis, and I realised that not all drugs are bad and.. It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.  \n\n\nThen.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze. I took some punches, told the truth and they wanted to beat someone else now.  \n (But it backfired in two hours and they wanted to meet me and prob beat me more.)  \n\n\nWhen I left, I was glad that I had not pissed myself or started crying. But my head was racing, I had never been so alert in my life. Adrenaline.  \nI did not realise that.. That was probarly the beginning of my PTSD. I became paranoid, I moved 2 days after that.  \n\n\n7 months later, I was in the military. I was not forced, but I thought it was a good idea and a nice life experience.  \n2,5-3 months in, it hit me. I started flinching, I started dreaming nightmares, I became dull in my head, I once grappled with a dude and.. I became so furious, and he had to hold me because, if he had let me go earlier than he did. I maybe would have done something rash. ( I can get angry, but I -never- act on it.. I did when I was a teen, but very rarely. )  \n\n\nI had to drop out, I felt that I was a failure. I came back to my country where I was born. (Neighbour country.)  \nI started living with my GF and.. That is where everything turned to shit.  \n\n\nI have stopped crying while writing, so that's nice. But I must have been occupied.. Less than a hour, but more than 20 minutes.   \n\n\nI have forgot to mention so much. Such as, I stopped being happy after the military. My symptoms worsened.  \nI did not know what was wrong with me back then, now I do.  \nIt felt like I was at fault, but I know now that it's just a illness or whatever you may call it.   \n(English is not my primary language.)\n\n  \nI'm going to talk to a therapist again, I'm waiting for a call. (Within 10 days.)  \nI try to be transparent how I feel with my GF but it's hard and sometimes I want to just fight it through without her help, because I don't want to take even more from her than she already gives me.\n\n  \nI found this sub yesterday, I was looking for a place to ventilate. I can't keep crashing and crying infront of my awesome girlfriend, I -must- get better because I don't want to lose her. (She really is the best, my gf during military cheated twice. Nice.) Anyhow, I read a post and.. The person writing felt the same way I did, I could see myself in several other posts, people who have it better or worse. And I felt glad, that I'm not crazy and you people also feel like I do.  \nI know, it's f\\*\\*ked up but thank you for feeling like this and thank you for sharing!", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1116, "end": 1271, "span": "I grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too.

It may not seem like those lies she told did much, but it was everyday and eventually it took a toll on my mental health. I'm now depressed, paranoid, I have anxiety, and PTSD. My sister got worse with how she treated me. She started physically fighting with me. If we got caught fighting she would fake cry and blame it on me. Our parents were the type to give spankings. I got those a lot, because of her. My parents always believed her because she's almost five years older than me. I remember the first time I tried to kill myself, it was after she got me in trouble one morning. I have this loose ceiling fan in my room. I was always a smart kid, but sometimes not in a good way. I was five, and I thought if I hang myself with my jump rope from my ceiling fan then if the jump rope breaks the fan will probably fall and kill me. My mom walked in the room and saw me tying a jump rope to my fan. She yelled at me and took the jump rope. I wasn't allowed near jump ropes for six years. Two months ago I had cut myself for the first time, because my sister lied again. I had flashbacks to all the other times she had hurt me in someway. I had a breakdown, and things have just been getting worse ever since. I've had the urge to cut again. Luckily I haven't, yet. I'm trapped in this house. I'm too young to leave, and my sister won't move out. I think I'm going to die here, so to everyone who reads this I want you to know what I've been wishing to have for a while now.

I don't care about feeling loved, I want to make someone feel loved. Sadly I don't think that I'll ever get to do that. So to anyone who feels that they aren't loved, just know that if I could, I would be there for you. I'm sorry I can't be there, but just know that I care. I'll always care, even if I die.

It\u2019s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  \n\nI hid it from the court, because it\u2019s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.\n\nAfter a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.\n\nIn my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.\n\n10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to \u201cjust climb out\u201d.  That fucking pit...\n\nTold the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I\u2019d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. \n\nThankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t want to deal with these people around me who didn\u2019t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn\u2019t want them to feel like me.  It\u2019s one of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you\u2019re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.\n\nTo avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It\u2019s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.\n\nWhat used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I\u2019ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven\u2019t done that since 06\u2019. \n\nAm I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That\u2019s still there right now.  But I\u2019m up.  \n\nI\u2019m doing choirs.  I\u2019m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it\u2019s been since I can remember.\n\nI\u2019ve read over what I\u2019ve written for about 20 min.    \n\nI guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:\n\nI still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I\u2019ll never be \u201cOk\u201d\n\nBUT\n\nThe pit is less deep and it\u2019s easier to climb out. \n\n\n\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 180, "end": 231, "span": "a marine I was in the same squad with killed himsel", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 27s "}}

{"id": "413_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**\n\n\n\n**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7\" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2\" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.\n\nFast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  \n\nAnother episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.\n\nI know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.\n\nSorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.\n\n**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**\n\n\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 163, "end": 284, "span": "I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 287, "end": 1263, "span": "I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).

{"id": "639_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I feel like a fake and like my PTSD is not valid. (Sexual assault trigger warning) Writing this on my phone and it's hard to tell how  much I am actually writing. Sorry if it's super long.\n\nTL;DR History of sexual assault. I feeI like a fake because people have had it so much worse than me and yet my ptsd runs my life. Feel embarrassed by my lack of experience with men which is a consequence of PTSD.\n\nI have struggled with this for a long time and I have avoided posting about it because I have been afraid of people confirming these feelings. I have been on medication prescribed to me for PTSD for a few years now and this has been my only way of allowing myself to feel valid. I don't tell people about my PTSD but when I have to I feel like I need to somehow slip the fact that I am medicated into the disclosure so that I will be taken seriously. When I say \"have to\" I am referring to situations such as the time I signed up for a self defense class and I needed them to know not to get on top of me in any way (will make sense later) and that I needed a female teacher. I needed to mention the PTSD for context. \n\nA little background: I have always had a fear of men and I can't really pinpoint when it started or why, but it was always more severe than the unfortunately common intimidation that many women tend to feel. I remember feeling this way as early as 7 or 8. I would avoid men in general. Experiences such as being cat called and followed in my early teens made it worse. \n\nThe experience which really caused my PTSD happened just after i moved away from home for college. I was at a friends house one night and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up in the middle of the night with a guy 'friend' straddling me and giving me hickeys and trying to take off my clothing. I told him to get off me multiple times and he didn't. I curled up into a fetal position until he gave up and left. It felt like he was on top of me for hours but I'm guessing it was more like 15 or 20 minutes. Nothing more happened, he got off me and fell asleep somewhere in the apartment, but it left me anxious and depressed for months.  I felt dirty and guilty. I couldn't look men in the eyes and any romantic attention from men felt even more threatening than it did for me already, even if I knew that they were probably very nice guys. Because of this I have never had a boyfriend. Never slept with a man. The first and last time I had sexual contact with a man was when I woke up to someone who I thought I could trust sucking on my neck and putting his hand under my blanket. I am nearly 25 now. Its embarrassing to me and I am afraid that, at this point, if I manage to move past the anxiety of male attention that I will scare away any man with my lack of experience.\n\nThat was the first one. The second event, which blew everything up, was when I was jumped walking home at night. I am a runner and a lot stronger than I look as a small woman and managed to get away. It left me so traumatized, though, because I tried really hard to get help and no one would help me. The security guard at my apartment building told me to stop talking and tell the female security guard who was only going to be working 4 days later, and the police laughed at me when I described what happened. (Might sound unlikely but I was living in another country at this time and this isnt uncommon behavior there).\n\nAt this point I would physically start to shake if I was hanging out with a man and he got touchy. Panic attack symptoms minus hyperventilation. \nI would feel my body go cold and my muscles seize up. There was a situation when I was trying to get over this all and had been on a few dates with a guy. He kissed me and all was fine until he touched my thigh and I started having a panic attack. I was so embarrassed and humiliated because he immediately left the room to tell him roommates. Yes, I know, I found myself an asshole.\n\nThat left me with really unhealthy views of men (even more than before) and I genuinely believed for a very long time that men did not feel love and that any appearance of love was purely a form of manipulation. These experiences along with an unfortunate mother (who would tell me things like \"all men cheat\") caused me to be so scared to fall in love because to me that would mean being a slave. It took me a very long time to realise that men do feel love. People will probably be wondering this: my father is in my life and he is a good man. One of the most honest and loving people I know. No issues there.\n\nAnyway, here I am years later. I have been through therapy, take antianxiety/antidepressants and have managed to cut down my PTSD meds to \"as needed\". So, Prazosin when I have nightmares, and that's all. I still get incredibly uncomfortable with men touching me and i am terrified of sex and it stops me from pursuing men I like. I am so worried that they will not be patient with me and that i am embarrassing. \n\nIt's also hard to know when to bring this up with a man because I dont want to scare him off but at the same time I dont want him to scare me off by going at a pace I cant handle. \n\nTo bring it back to my post title....I feel like a fraud. There are women who have been through experiences infinitely worse than mine and yet here I am complaining about it. It's so hard to like life.
