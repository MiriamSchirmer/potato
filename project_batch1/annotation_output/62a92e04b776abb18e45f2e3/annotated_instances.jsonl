From the age of 5 till the time I was 13 my cousin would  touch me and his sister. Fingering us \u201cplaying doctor\u201d telling us that since it hurt it was our fault and something was wrong with us. See my cousin was caught with his sister but since I was so embarrassed I never said a things leading to her getting the help and therapy she needed while I dwelled with this self hatred for allowing it to continue so long.  I finally snapped and was hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I opened up to the psychiatrist as much as I felt comfortable doing. Which wasn\u2019t much. Anyway I bounced between plenty of  therapists before giving up on therapy all together I\u2019ve never really learned a good way to cope. (I had my first thoughts of self harm again recently and that\u2019s scary to me I don\u2019t want to fall back down that path) \nI recently got into a new relationship and I\u2019ve never had a problem with this until recently. My mind likes to play this game where it twists the truth and so it has lead to a trust issue between me and my boyfriend. Which led to the flash backs returning, and it\u2019s at very hard times like when we\u2019re going to get intimate break down and start crying. Which makes me feel like complete shit as my boyfriend doesn\u2019t deserve it.  he\u2019s very patient and understands since I opened up to him about what happened. He stops right away to make sure I\u2019m ok I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s fair to him (or myself)  Anyway I guess what I\u2019m asking is how do I go about releasing this pent up trauma and how do I help myself cope?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 152, "end": 344, "span": "From the age of 5 till the time I was 13 my cousin would  touch me and his sister.

{"id": "1673_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Things get easier. My experience of getting better. Brief mention of abuse without getting into details (also start and end are pointed out) This post was supposed to be a rant. \nI was feeling a bit gloomy after a flash-back, but as I kept writing I started to calm down. Hence the change in the tone.\n\nAlso, I wanted to point out that what I'm talking about is obviously just a small part of the process of getting back on your feet, but still it felt essential to me. Everyone's experience is different and this is just my personal perspective. \n\nSorry for my broken English, I hope this can be helpful to someone. \n\nI guess I have improved a lot in the last year. \nI really don't want to go back to the hole of despair I was trapped in, but sometimes I get scared I might let myself slip off into it again.\n\nTo prevent that, I make sure to bury any thoughts about my past very deep as soon as I sense them arise, of course some of them manage to sneak out and they get back at me in spades.\n\nI still get glimpses of moments I had successfully forgotten about. \nIt makes me feel like I'm still there, but it happens less and less frequently and every time it gets easier to snap back. \n\nUp until a year ago, I was leading a life that was split in half between the present and the past. \nThe present seemed to be so dull, as if I were half-asleep, while the past felt so much more real and threatening.\n\nI used to be so angry, I don't know how else to describe it other than it felt like fire was running through my veins. It was the only thing I felt and I couldn't help but cling to it, since it seemed to be my life's sole purpose and sustenance.\n \nI kept reliving the events of my trauma, going through them in my head over and over again. Each time getting angrier and angrier. \nI didn't mind it at all, I was actually glad for this blind rage. As if it fueled me. \n\n**START OF TRIGGER WARNING**\n\nI had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. \n\n**END OF TRIGGER WARNING**\n\nAfter I escaped, ordinary life was simply idle.\nHadn't it been for this anger, I would have just gone numb.\n\nAlthough comforting, I came to realize that I would have never been able to move forward without letting go of it all, the anger, the constant replay of gruesome scenes in my mind, the pointless questions that would never find any answers.\n\nThings were also getting out of hand, to the point where I involuntarily broke my friend's arm as I was startled by her giving me a hug unexpectedly. \nI was horrified at what I had done. \nI'm a petite girl but I've been fighting professionally for a long time and I couldn't bear the thought of harming someone whose only fault was getting caught between my messed up brain and me. \n\nIt's a hard process to forget about the abuse I had been through as a child and then again as an adult, but I'm managing and it does get easier. \nI had never thought it to be true, but time really does heal all wounds.\n\nBut most importantly it's the people you love. Keep them close. Even if you feel the need to cut everybody off and confine yourself in your pain, don't. Don't let this trauma induced sentiment prevail.\nIt's not what you or your loved ones need. \nThe ones we care about are the only thing that keeps us grounded to reality, to the present. \nYou can take small steps, there's no rush, you don't have to let everyone in on everything you are feeling unless you want to. Just try, as difficult as it is, to be open to their affection. \n\nBeing passionate about something is hard after you have survived trauma and readjusting to everyday life is particularly disorienting when you don't have a purpose, you just feel hollow. A good place to start is making it a point to be able to take care of the people you love. Having to be someone your dear ones can rely on, eventually makes you get back on track and you are going to become even stronger than you were before. \n\nIt's ironic how being a survivor makes you feel so dead inside, it might feel like you have lost all control over your own body and mind. \nBut please know this kind of feelings are only temporary. You have gone through a nightmare and made it out alive. You will overcome these feelings as well. \n \nYou won't have to look back at the person you were before in sorrow, you are growing to become someone you will learn to love. \nYou will have suffered greatly and still been able to pull yourself back up, you can accomplish anything you put your mind to. \n\nLife only gets better and better from here, it's tough but so are you.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1928, "end": 2148, "span": "I had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. \r\n\r\n", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 54s "}}

And note that I am currently in a safe environment and in no way am in danger. The only issue is the mental issues. Also here's my trigger warning if you're reading to read.\n\n               I've been having a lot of issues recently. I... need a public place to vent where things can stay anonymous. It's been getting worse recently but I've had what I can only assume is depression anxiety and PTSD which left untreated for the last 7 or 8 years as I do not have a good way to get to a doctor. I self harmed for years but stopped after Thanksgiving (American holiday) in 2017. But since before that I've been having an issue where occasionally I would have violent flashbacks of my abusive father and self harm and feel like I'm back in those moments and then to only get shot back into reality starring into nothing while in the midst of a panic attack. It didn't happen all the time and would usually be a few days up to a few weeks apart but recently it has become common and happens 1 or 2 to 3 or 4 times, if bad, a day. This mixed with a constant depressive feeling of dread, depression, and regression has made everything incredibly hard to deal with and I've start to crack recently and break down more often. \n\n                 I... don't really know what else to say.

{"id": "1786_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Significant other of 17.5 years has been diagnosed with PTSD for a year now due to traumatic event (he\u2019s a civilian). I\u2019m at a loss. Some background information. He (32 m) and I (31 f) have been together almost 18 years now. We moved to our current location after I accepted a job position about two years ago, and he had his little brother move down about four months after that. We all got really close. Flash forward to October 2018.\n\nHe and his brother work out of town, on the morning of the incident his little brother was killed right in front of him for absolutely no reason, seriously, no reason. He blames himself, has been in and out of rehab centers (he uses illicit drugs, and most recently, alcohol) to numb himself and avoid reality. Our family lives about 14 hours from us, so really it\u2019s just him and me. \n\nPlease understand I am not trying to portray myself as a victim. I just honestly don\u2019t know what to do. He doesn\u2019t want to face what happened and work through the trauma, he just tries numbing it. Everything gets taken out on me. I listen, boy do I listen, to every detail of what happened that morning. I understand it is good for him to get it out, but I am not a licensed therapist. He refuses to see a professional. Lately, his drinking has increased so much he drinks straight liquor like it\u2019s water and I become his verbal punching bag. He blacks out every night not remembering what he said/did. It\u2019s getting to be a lot. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t him, that it\u2019s his PTSD. I don\u2019t want this to be the end of our relationship, but in all honesty, I\u2019m at such a loss. It\u2019s a lot on my shoulders to take care of everything that isn\u2019t related to him and his PTSD and then adding that on top of my regular responsibilities. I have no support from his family, it\u2019s kind of like an out of sight out of mind ordeal. \n\nHonestly, at this point, I\u2019m just looking for some help or guidance. Like I said, I don\u2019t want the relationship to end, and his brother wouldn\u2019t want his death to result in the either. But there is only so much I can do to help him without him getting the actual help he needs, professional help. What am I doing wrong? Are there things I could be doing different? Is it selfish to want to put \u201cme\u201d first in my own life?\n\nSorry for the rambling.

{"id": "1509_ptsd", "displayed_text": "A couple weeks ago I randomly remembered about 1.5-2 years I guess I forgot. I repressed most of my childhood and I like it that way, but I didn't realize I was missing adult years. Anyone else lose large amounts of time as an adult? I'm not sure how to explain this. I'll start by saying I moved out right at 18, but ages 19-21 have always been hard to remember. I'm 37. Before now, I could tell an occasional story about those years but I couldn't ever get a timeline to make sense for me and never wanted to delve too deep into it. Mostly I think my memory loss is a protective measure and I appreciate and enjoy it. \n\nAll of a sudden, out if the blue, it hit me like a ton of bricks and the full extent of my repression was glaringly apparent. It was to the point where up until recently, the information about where I thought lived during part of that time would have even been wrong. Now I'm being flooded with memories of a time I now know I didn't want to remember. I don't want them. \n\nIt also makes me question my reality. For example: A couple years ago something happened at a bar where I was sexually assaulted. I always thought I was roofied because that time is just gone. I don't know what happened, just that I was missing for a while after going outside, and I got out of someone's grip pulling my arm really hard in the alley behind the bar. I was covered in bruises and could barely walk for days afterwards. Talking it over with some friends, I'm not sure I'm missing enough time to have been drugged, and no idea what happened in that alley. \n\nBasically, I feel insane because of my memory loss.

What would you do?  \n\nIam 24 years old and for more than a decade iam suffering. My current situation is really difficult. This year i wanted to go to university again, but my medical condition is a living hell. My problem is my body is 24/7 in an \"emergency situation\". That means it feels to me like my own body is a prison/enemy to me. I can barely breathe, i dont sleep well (for years) and my stomach is so hard to the point i feel emotionless. It feels to me this is taking 80% of my energy. Over the year  \"being depressed\" became the new normal for me.\n\nThe relationship to my parents is really difficult. I experienced a lot of abuses. Want some examples?\n- At age 7 i was trying to sleep in a room with my brother in the evening. I was scared of \"monsters\" under the bed, so i asked my little brother if he could come to sleep beside me (children), so i dont need to be scared anymore. A few moments later my fundamental religious father came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground. Then he started to beat my little childrens body with his foot. My stomach hurt was hit by his foot. 1 Minute later my mum came to him, but she just observed and didnt do anything. Then it began to hurt so much, i was thinking i would die. So i crawled on my knees to my mothers feet and told her  \"mommy please tell him to stop\". But he kept going by this time punching me in the face, so blood came out of my nose. As he noticed the blood, he grabbed me by my t-shirt and pulled me like a dog to the bathroom, where he forced me to wash my blood. I was so little i couldnt reach the water so he gave me something to stand above. While cleaning the blood i was crying and most importantly my body was vibrating enormously.\n\n- At age 8 i should take my little brother to play with my friend outdoors. Like most children i wanted to play with my own friends and don't want to ( Alone the fact letting a 5years and 8 years old playing for several hours alone on the street is crazy). Then my father saw me coming down the street and asked where i was, i said \"i was on the playground\". As he knew i didnt take my brother with me, he was so aggressive i got scared of him. I literally was so scared i began to run away from him. I ran the street down and now comes the crazy thing. He began to run wild after me and i screamed as loud as a i could \"HELP\", but nobody noticed. As i couldnt run anymore, i instinctively put my hands before my face, in fear he would punch me in the face. \n\n-At Age 6 i behave badly in the opinion of my parents and they scared to beat me, so i left the building block and waited infront of the bus stop for several hours in the cold. I Brief the whole time and each time a bus come by (every 20 minutes) i started to control it, so no stranger noticed me. Every two minutes i looked to the door, to look if they let me in again.\n\n- At age 16 i was really hungry and cooked a little meal for myself. My father told me i should share it with my brother. I told him no, there is enough left he can cook for himself, he is old enough. He was so angry he took my plate with the food on it and threw it in front of me into the garbage. Then he became more aggressive and and destroyed the plate with a spoon in front my eyes and forced me to clean everything up. At this time school already was really hard for me emotional, so i cried silently desperate while cleaning everything.\n\n- One day at age 15 or so he came in a aggressive mood in my childrens room ( dont remember why), we had a discussion and then began to threat me by coming really near to me, holding his fingers between his teeths saying \"iam craazy\".", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1053, "end": 1910, "span": "A few moments later my fundamental religious father came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground.
