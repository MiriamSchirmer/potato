Although beginning deceptively normal, it quickly and suddenly spiralled into a cycle of abuse, crudely disguised as love. It began with my communication with her having to be constant, unfaltering; this was preferable to the threat of her becoming upset and ignoring or guilt tripping me - or really using any emotional manipulation tactic that you can think of. \n\nWithout me really being able to grasp what was happening, I had been fully isolated from my friends and family, and really, the whole world. She had dragged me into a delusional foli\u00e9 a deux, in which I constantly faced the threat of rejection, shame, dread, isolation and a whole selection of other rotten, empty feelings. \n\nIn addition to the emotional abuse, she coerced and manipulated me into engaging in sexual acts with her, despite me outlining specifically that I did not want to do so. \n\nSex became the only way for me to feel as if I was good enough for her, and bore some of the only moments at which she seemed happy and pleased with me. It was exhausting and bestowed on me deep, deep guilt, but if I were to refuse she would emotionally blackmail me and because deeply upset. \n\nShe escalated these sexual encounters to the point of extremity, forcing me to buy condoms when I was on the verge of tears. After these sexual encounters i would often cry, and grow increasingly dislodged from my own body, as it was my only coping mechanism to escape the abuse.  I did everything I could to avoid the same occurrence again; dropping change so we wouldn't have the \u00a32.90 for the condoms, refusing to leave the house if I knew that was her intent, fabricating lies about whatever I had to. \n\nI remember once, after telling her I didn't want to, the look on her face in a moment of brief lucidity which interrupted her brigade of plastic emotion, when she mentioned casually that if she got me to agree, then it would essentially be rape. \n\nThe further our relationship progressed, the more distant from reality I became, the further I grew from my family and the further my timid self retreated inwards, in hiding.\n\nMy travelling to France during the holidays exhibited some of the worst torment I had faced, despite not being in person. Her behaviour was amplified and she still had me almost completely under her illusion, although she was slowly losing her grip.\n\nShe would demand to have the passwords to all of my social media, and dig up conversations from months, years prior to dig up as evidence of cheating and disloyalty, only to ignore me for as long as she deemed appropriate and make me feel as guilty as she knew how to.\n\nWeeks before the end of our relationship, she joined me on a family caravaning holiday, which was, in hindsight, hell on earth.

I, of course, had no idea where on earth she was (she had a nasty habit of doing this) and in my delirious, desperate, confused state, my brain fabricated these tall, black figures who had taken her, as if to create a reason where it was not provided anything remotely attached to reality. Upon being found by my father, urgently pacing around looking for her, hysterical, she expressed no sympathy or concern, but simply offered an empty, dry sorry. \n\nThere are countless other situations I could site, but I think that these I have documented here serve the purpose of explanation well enough. \n\nIn august of last year is when it hits it peak and when I finally severed my ties with her. A barrage of insults following an exhausting, draining, empty argument was my breaking point, and in my desperation I reached out to my present family and family friends, who pointed out to me the reality of the situation. \n\nUpon reflection, it is clear to me that her actions were a result of her own past trauma, and I hold nothin against her. I have learned that holding anger in your heart does nothing but create more pain and sorrow. I also realise that I was so susceptible to her manipulation, as my mother struggled and is struggling with mental health issues, which lead to her being admitted into hospital for spells of time from when I was about 10-13.

I was still trying to get it back together because I couldn't explain it at the ER and I didn't want insurance make me have to face him in court. I should have seen it coming. Three months before that, he screamed in my face and grabbed me by the shoulders. I ignored the blazing red flags. I still experience daily pain. Roughly twelve hours before that he'd shoved me over the couch (I have a serious back injury which I finally had my spine fused for recently, and that has long been a huge no no for me) and yanked my pants down to try to fuck me while his 4 y.o. daughter was in the bathroom. He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly. I was shocked because he hadn't done anything like that in the 11.5 months we'd been together, but as a testament to my prior experiences with abuse, I saw it as nothing terribly abnormal.

He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly.

The dog was special needs which usually means he was dog aggressive which he was. What this boils down to is that I took him out to play in the morning, and again in the afternoon.  The Pit had seen a dog next door and lost it. I went through protocol to redirect his attention to me so that we could continue to play, but when none of that worked sp I squirted water onto his neck.\n\nAll that agression redirect to me, and he gave me no indication that he was going to attack so it surprised me when he jumped up going straight for my throat. Luckily I reacted and punched him in the face. Here I am moving cars and trash cans using them as buffers between me and the dog until he brings me down, and goes ham on my leg almost to the point of breaking it.\n\nLong story short it's been five months since this event, and my official diagnostic of PTSD. Isn't getting any better even with the help of my therapist. Nightmares always escalate to where the Pit snapped my neck. \n\nI just needed to post this. I was too afraid to put it on my normal social media accounts because the back lash from pit bull sympathizers,  and to me it dosen't matter it was a pit bull it could have been any dog breed. It just makes life hard when even the smallest of dogs prevent me from enjoying life, and when I feel conflicted about my love of dogs especially when I live in a highly populated dog area."}, "872_counseling": {"id": "872_counseling", "text": "I have been married for 11 years.
