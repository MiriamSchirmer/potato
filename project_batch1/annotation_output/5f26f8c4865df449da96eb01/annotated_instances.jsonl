I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life\u2019s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.\n\n2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I\u2019m seeing therapists but they haven\u2019t put down a diagnosis yet) as I\u2019m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I\u2019ve had to stop work for the moment because I can\u2019t cope.\n\nI am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner\u2019s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.\n\nIt\u2019s father\u2019s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven\u2019t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it\u2019s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don\u2019t resolve any issues. And it\u2019s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn\u2019t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it\u2019s taken a full toll on me.\n\nThe relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn\u2019t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father\u2019s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad\u2019s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn\u2019t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I\u2019m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I\u2019m terrified about my future and whether I\u2019ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I\u2019m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn\u2019t that good to start with. My parents don\u2019t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).\n\nRight now I don\u2019t feel safe and I don\u2019t know what to do.

I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent/ramble/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)\n\nI had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. \n\nI've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. \n\nNope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. \n\nAnd then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then \"wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?\" \n\nAnd then the floodgates started to open. \n\n*  \"Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable\"      \n* \"Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.\"      \n* \"I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me. All two of the physical fights I have been in, have been with him when he was in the house and I snapped after he wouldn't leave despite me begging mom to have him leave\"      \n* \"What are the other symptoms of ptsd? (googles) ... disturbed sleep? ...\" (i am a violent sleeper. i dont put sheets on anymore as they 100% always are ripped off as i thrash in my sleep\"     \n* \"and... shouting in your sleep? ......\" (no conscious memory, but apparently every night i shout out things. my mom doesnt mention it much anymore unless it was a bad night, but whenever i share a hotel with someone I wake up to \"why were you shouting \"stop go away stop\" at 3 AM?\")           \n* \"what else cou- nightmares too?\" (never related to trauma in a way i can discern, but have nightmares that wake me up screaming in about 1/3 sleeps)             \n* \"exaggerated startle response? Does that mean what I think? ... Yes. ... fuck...\" (its not quite as severe anymore but i used to invariably freak out if someone touched me without me seeing it. My dad(never hit me, never abused me, was the chill parent) used to poke me in the car at random, just jokingly. I would flinch and recoil every time. Eventually I got to a point where I would sit pushed against the passenger side door to try and get away from it. He asked me at the time why I flinched and got scared, he never hit me. I didnt know why I did that but I couldnt stop. Now I dont do well with people touching me at random, surprising noises, loud bangs, sirens and fire alarms)   \n\nIt was like I was looking at a connect the dots, and the dots were all in a straight line in numerical order. I got deeply confused. Why hadn't I ever talked to my psychiatrists about this? Why didn't I realize I have flashbacks weekly or more? Why didn't I realize hearing aggressive shouting is very prone to do this, even from strangers in public, or in film/tv? Why didn't I realize my reaction to the memory or presence of my moms abuser far exceeds what is normal? Why did I not connect my hatred of his face, Heineken, the smell of spilled beer, or his cologne with this? How did I never admit this? Any of this? Why did I always deny I had trauma issues or dodge the question so deftly, all the while completely unconscious of what I was dodging? What the fuck do I do now? \n\nI feel like I wasn't hurt badly enough. I wasn't the direct target of any of his violence until I was an adult. It wasn't sexual or combat related. It didn't ruin my life(depression did that for me) like my friend, who I knew disassociates for hours and wakes up multiple times nightly from the nightmares. I feel guilty for even considering it, but I detect too many characteristics that line up for me to ignore it. I'm making an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I've been seeing psychiatrists for 9 years by now and I've never done this. \n\nMy sense of self and my understanding of my mental health has been destroyed. I feel like I was assembling a jigsaw puzzle of myself, was mostly done, and perhaps 40% of the puzzle just got torn off, mixed up, and the pieces thrown across the floor. I've always felt that if nothing else, I knew what happens to my brain. I thought it has been the same for years now. That there wasn't more to discover, just need to work more therapy and cope better. But there's been a giant red neon sign saying \"THESE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS YOU DOLT\" here the whole time and I've been blind to it. What else could I have missed? How deep does this trauma stuff run? How am I supposed to self evaluate when I can apparently never be objective about these things? What use is talking about ones symptoms if I managed to perfectly lie to myself and to my doctors and therapists for all of these years?\n\nIt's so plainly obvious, I think I must have subconsciously been refusing to accept it. To protect.. something. That's why I think I was able to take off the blinders about this when I was uninhibited through the drugs I took to calm down. Its my only thought I've managed to come up with regarding why I never saw the plainly obvious truth, and instead unconsciously denied and avoided, with expert skill, connecting the symptoms to trauma. Even the flashbacks. I always just thought I was being dramatic and emotional. I never had a thought about them beyond \"oh just ignore it\". Even though I knew what PTSD commonly presents as. Even though I didn't think I was hiding anything or that I would hide anything like this. \n\nI'm talking to my psychiatrist soon. I don't look forward to it at all. I have a feeling it will be awful trying to say any of this. I don't even know what's next. I am not able to reduce my exposure to my triggers. I can't control him. My mom thinks I should like him and has never understood how upset I get. Even when I (of all people, never hurt a fly, never wanted to fight anyone, ever) have been so upset by his presence, combined with hearing his inescapable voice in my bedroom, that I attacked him. Two different times. I can't even type this post without crying from this. Talking. Ugh. :(\n\nSorry for this huge wall of text. I'm just. My brain feels like scrambled eggs. So many questions. Feel so lost about who/what I am as a person and what my mental illness means and how they affect me. It's seemingly all gone out the window and I'm put back at the start.

{"id": "1265_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. \n\nGoing to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. \n\nI was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.\n\nI dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. \n\nI dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.\n\nHonestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.\n\nI feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. \n\nIt's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. \n\nBut still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. \n\nI'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.\n\nI know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. \n\n**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks.

When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.\n\nI just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at.

I only recall this once but is this okay? I've heard many of my friends say that they've been hit too (as it's sort of asain culture). I remeber I was in trouble because I lied to my mother due to being afraid of being caught and hit again.\n\nIs this okay?\n\nI feel like I did something to deserve it in a way\nAnyways when she was yelling at me I only heard a ringing noise and my vision started to turn black. I wasn't really able to see her but I heard her clearly. I remember that I didn't say anything cause I was too scared admit it to her and getting into more trouble.\nRight now I haven't been spanked (or hit) but I just remember it vividly and I don't have the guys to tell my mother about it. I remember my mother saying how \"liars go to hell\", \"why'd you lie about your grades? I would have found out anyways\", \"why do I take you to tutor when you'll just get B's?\", \"look at me\" and \"why are you crying?\"\n\nAnyways I feel guilty... I recently heard she had rheumatism (I think) right after I was born. I'm the only child right now and I just feel like I have to get good grades so I can do something...

{"id": "2229_ptsd", "displayed_text": "OD PTSD Sorry long story of overdose ..  I need some advice about something I exeprienced in which I cant really find anything similar to my personal account of seeing someone overdose elswhere online to try and get some answers, other perspectives...\nalthough im still on the younger side, i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse just everything in which i am grateful for because it has made me very tough and able to relate with others.. i was dead sure i could handle anything but this . this has turned my world upside downn. it happened last july and i am much better mentally now but i still struggle with ptsd and triggers... i met this kid wonderful heart but misguided (not an addict)  and still has that feeling of invincibility..anyways we were in my room and the first incident we were on my bed and he was holding himself up on top of me kissing me and then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless . ill admit my first reaction was wrong, i was scared, and didnt realize his breathing and heart were stopping i was just shaking him yelling his name.. luckily he popped up and was like what happened wherr am i.. but quickly fell back into his high .. i knew from there something wasnt right so i was on high alert  (he had apparently taken stuff before he got to my house that i was guessing but wasnt sure).. after that he  snorted one in front of me i begged him to stop but he wouldnt and i couldnt force him to stop in that mindset he had . he then went in to use my bathroom (separate toilet room from shower area) and i was like okay ill just keep calling his name to make sure hes okay.. ( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right\u00bf but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone \"stops breathing\" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn ..", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 292, "end": 342, "span": "i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2233, "end": 2807, "span": "ould see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best)", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 46s "}}
