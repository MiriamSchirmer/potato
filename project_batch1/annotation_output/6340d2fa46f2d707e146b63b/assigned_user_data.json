We felt like having a little bit of fun, but only took one tab each so that I could still drive and we could just cruise around all night tripping. So skip ahead some time and at this point it was around 3am. We were driving on some back roads in a country area. We felt this was a good place to stay because it wasn't populated and no one else was on the road. There was also no police that came by this area usually. We took a turn on a road and started heading down it. This was a road we haven't been on before. It was very dark, no street lights. When we turn a corner I see blinking lights from a car and then I see that the car was smashed into a tree. I was tripping balls at this point, but I felt I couldn't not go and see if anyone was hurt or not. I pull up behind the car and my girlfriend begs me to not go.

Why would you not want to get it over with? You are going to do it.\u201d Then the sound of him shooting himself replayed in my head echoing. The 2nd person, wasn\u2019t anyone I knew. It was a kid I saw hang himself on morbid reality, after the suicide I developed an almost sexual obsession with observing death. This was the first time I saw it happen on the internet, the same feeling echoed through my brain. The kid told me that it was my turn to be watched by the public. Then the video replayed in my dream with the sound of him struggling for air and finally passing. The third one was my ex husband, who was probably the worst. In the dream, he kept telling me to do it as he cut himself deeper and deeper in his arm. Then he said I\u2019m gonna do it, all because of you too. You deserve to die, then at the end of the dream he kept holding me down to put a knife against my throat and said this is how it ends, just do it yourself.\u201d\n\nI am also looking into talking to someone I can somewhat relate to on this, talking to your friends about this typically doesn\u2019t help me.\n\nThank you for listening."}, "781_ptsd": {"id": "781_ptsd", "text": "We are not a statistic (I hope you don't mind me posting this -- \\*\\*\\*TRIGGER WARNING\\*\\*\\*)\n\nPutting this out to the universe in the hopes that the universe responds.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRape, sexual assault, and PTSD do not know fame, race, or gender.
