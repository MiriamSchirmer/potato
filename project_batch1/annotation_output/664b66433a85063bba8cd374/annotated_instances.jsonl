{"id": "246_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Sleep Paralysis and PTSD: Unwelcome Truth Realized Hey everyone,\n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD because I grew up in a very abusive home with drug addicts and alcoholics. My family is very twisted so I avoid them at all cost but my mother recently revealed that I \"may have been\" (her words) sexually assaulted by my uncle, who molested her. I witnessed him attempt to molest her when I was younger, so I don't doubt this.\n\nHe was a very abusive to my family (we lived with him on/off till I was 15) because he was a mean drunk and would cut phone cords and start physical fights with my grandparents and my mom. I remember he used to tie me up with duct tape and cover my mouth and would keep me in his room. I don't remember if anything happened but after my experience with sleep paralysis - I'm kind of messed up and feel like I do remember now. \n\nI hope I am making sense because I am on high-alert right now.\n\nI felt my mind wake up but I couldn't move my body. I felt like something was in the room and it was trying to confine/take me with blankets. I felt it actually trying to confine me. I felt its hands touching me. At first, I thought it was little gremlins, but then I thought of my uncle, and I attempted to scream for help. I kept trying to move my body but I was stuck.\n\nIt's been 4 hours since that happened and I am terrified and I feel violated and sick. I'm not sure what is going on. But I feel alone, sad, scared, and like I don't want to try anymore. I just feel so sick and confused and like an epiphany exploded in my head. \n\nI don't know what I am expecting but I don't have anyone to talk to who will understand.   \n\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 635, "end": 638, "span": "tie", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 639, "end": 641, "span": "me", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 642, "end": 644, "span": "up", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 645, "end": 649, "span": "with", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 650, "end": 654, "span": "duct", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 655, "end": 659, "span": "tape", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 660, "end": 663, "span": "and", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 664, "end": 669, "span": "cover", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 670, "end": 672, "span": "my", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 673, "end": 678, "span": "mouth", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 689, "end": 693, "span": "keep", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 694, "end": 696, "span": "me", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 697, "end": 699, "span": "in", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 700, "end": 703, "span": "his", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 704, "end": 708, "span": "room", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1119, "span": "hands", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1128, "span": "touching", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1131, "span": "me", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 59s "}}

So, my brother is 25 right now and I am turning 17 in May. When I was 7 he r*ped me and I didn\u2019t tell my parents until October of 2018...Since then all that has happened it a switch of rooms because he used to have to walk through my room to get to his. He still lives with us because he has high functioning autism and can only really work at a grocery (as he is now). My parents don\u2019t want him to work too much or he will no longer get disability and they\u2019re scared he\u2019ll have a fit at work and get fired even though he\u2019s been working there for like 2 years and been fine.\nWe don\u2019t have enough money to get him an apartment. My parents don\u2019t think he could survive on his own, so I\u2019m stuck living with him. \nSince I told he doesn\u2019t talk to me or look at me. I do the same towards him. This was until maybe 3 months ago when he had an outburst and screamed at me saying I\u2019m a \u201cjunkie lair who should finish what she started and kill yourself\u201d (I used to smoke weed and have attempted suicide before). \nHe\u2019s had an outburst like this three times now where he yells at me while I lock myself in another room. Talked to my dad about it and he said unless he sexually touches me or punches me hard (not light shoving) they aren\u2019t going to kick him out.\nA week ago I was sleeping on the couch because it\u2019s right by my parents room and makes me feel more sleep. He then went into the living room in the middle of the night and slept in the middle of the floor.\nHe\u2019s being creepy. He yells at me like once every week and half calling me a lair etc. Being in a house with him without going to school or to friends makes me feel terrible.\nI would stay at a friends but my mom has severe COPD so I can\u2019t because of the virus.\nI don\u2019t think I can do anything. I\u2019m only allowed to leave the house for a 2 hour walk every other day. I\u2019m unable to function well enough to get my schoolwork done. I feel terrible.

I don\u2019t want to hurt myself but I almost want to go to a psychward so I don\u2019t have to be here! Or run away and live under a bridge! Or something! I feel so fucking trapped.\nIf you read all of this please at least comment \u201cthat\u2019s fucked up\u201d so I know I\u2019m not crazy for feeling so terrible because my parents are acting like it\u2019s not big deal while also saying they believe me and it\u2019s making me feel nuts. \nSorry this is so long and badly written.

{"id": "594_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I think i cured my violent sexual trauma and \"fetish\" by getting it to happen to me again. Is this possible? Is it sick? Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it \"rape\" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.\n\n\n At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).\n\n\nI hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be \"real raped, choked\" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.\n\n\n2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming \"OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP\" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.\n\n\nOver the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???\n\n\nTL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick \"fetish\". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 149, "end": 157, "span": "sexually", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 158, "end": 164, "span": "abused", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 165, "end": 171, "span": "almost", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 172, "end": 177, "span": "daily", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 178, "end": 180, "span": "as", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 181, "end": 182, "span": "a", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 183, "end": 186, "span": "kid", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 541, "end": 546, "span": "raped", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 548, "end": 557, "span": "strangled", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 558, "end": 561, "span": "for", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 562, "end": 563, "span": "2", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 564, "end": 571, "span": "minutes", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 598, "end": 602, "span": "gave", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 603, "end": 605, "span": "me", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 606, "end": 611, "span": "shots", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 612, "end": 614, "span": "of", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 615, "end": 622, "span": "alcohol", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 811, "end": 820, "span": "violently", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 821, "end": 826, "span": "threw", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 827, "end": 829, "span": "me", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 830, "end": 832, "span": "on", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 833, "end": 836, "span": "the", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 837, "end": 843, "span": "ground", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 878, "end": 882, "span": "arms", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 883, "end": 887, "span": "were", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 888, "end": 894, "span": "around", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 895, "end": 897, "span": "my", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 898, "end": 902, "span": "neck", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 3m 6s "}}
