I'm not exaggerating.  I was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when I was in middle school.  His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom\u2019s house, and I was so awe-stricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time.  Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs.  My mom went to prison for that and lost her caf\u00e9.  We live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and I was bullied because of who my parents were.  My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison. \n   My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person\u2019s house.  My parents did not get along at this point.  We were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out.  He got out of the car, went to the driver\u2019s side, and punched my mom in the face.  I got out and told him not to hit my mom.

I think a lot of it is that I can't bring myself to forgive him.  My mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, I moved in with my dad\u2019s mom (the one who lived just down the road) because I trust her, her house is stable, and she's more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents.

Help Long story, but read if you can. \n\nI came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. \n\nAbout a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. \n\nLots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. \n\nThe day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear \"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said \"one sec\" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. \n\nDuring this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. \n\nSince I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. \n\nIt got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. \n\nDo I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. \n\nI miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. \n\nanything will help. ", "displayed_text": "I am a college student and I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment.

After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7\" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2\" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.

I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.\n\nI realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.\n\n**Background**\n\nGrowing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she \"made it to where I didn't have to testify\". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.\n\nI had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by \"quickly and physically ending the disagreement\". After hearing that I got out of his car, said \"goodbye\" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for \"leaving\" them.\n\n**The Videos**\n\nI started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought \"Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first.\" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled \"1996\" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying \"no\" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?\n\nI was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from \"1996\" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks \"right?\" to my sister and she says something like \"only mom and dad think \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is a brat.\" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.\n\nI gave myself a couple days after that footage. I was afraid I'd see something worse. I decided to watch my sisters birthday party in 1996. It was on another tape labeled \"1996\". My sister is turning 5 and we are at the local pool with some childhood friends and some family. I see my cousin and I see my childhood friend. I instantly remember inappropriate things happening with those boys. My cousin used to pretend we were \"married\" when we were around that age. He would make me go into a bathroom after our \"marriage\" and undress with him. He always locked the door. He is about 2 years older than I am. I remember feeling like it was wrong but that he was older so it must be ok. I don't remember much of what happened in the bathrooms when this stuff used to happen. I know for sure it happened in 2 places. I know I was crying at one of them and my sister was knocking on the door. It was a family vacation. He has a daughter now and she is about 5. I hate him.\n\nMy childhood friend I mentioned, he also made me take my clothes off because of what \"grown ups do when they get married\". This must have been at the same age as my cousin incident. I remember something weird he did once he made me lay on top of him, he said we had to touch nipples....then I remember his mother walked in on us. I felt instant embarrassment and guilt, but being so young, I didn't know exactly what was wrong. She never said anything or did anything. This friend is still in my life and also has a brand new daughter. They were at my wedding and so was that cousin. I feel sick thinking about this. How could his mother not have done anything!!?? I saw her face in that video too and felt even more sick. Once we were in the high school ages, we spent more time together. He talked me into cheating on my boyfriends because \"kissing isn't cheating\". He'd feel me up and I told myself it was ok because we weren't having sex. I hate myself for this.\n\nI hate seeing these people on my video tapes and remembering these things. It makes me feel like my family isn't real. It makes me question if things really happened even though I know certain things definitely did. I continue to doubt myself and pretend I'm ok. I'm not ok. I'm having a very hard time with these new things and I feel physically sick reliving these things.\n\n**Can having abusers in life be a pattern for some survivors?**\n\nI have had far too many moments in my life where my innocence was taken from me or I was hurt in different ways. I was raped by an ex for years. He took photos of me after he drugged me when he took me out of the country. He was so much like my father. So many red flags and I should have ran screaming, but he was SO manipulative. He told me no one would ever love me like he loved me. He exposed me to HEP-C for years and never told me. He cheated on me. He would tell me I was overweight and that my style was boring. He told me I didn't \"do anything\". He would force me to have sex with him every day multiple times a day. I was fresh from treatment, he was sober and had been for years. I thought he was safe. He even convinced my mother he was great along with other family. He has thousands of nude photos of me from the age of 18-22. He refused to destroy them when I begged for many years. He'd always convince me to come back when I'd leave him or when he said something painfully horrible. He'd show up at my apartments while I was in college in the middle of the night yelling at me. He was a 3x felon. He was an addict and when I left for good, he started drinking again and then using drugs. No idea where he is now, but I pray it's prison. He had his 3 strikes.\n\nI also have been in a friendship where a guy in college became obsessed with me and stalked me. I had to go to the Dean of Students because he had signed up to be in every one of my classes. This was after he had left things at my doorstep, stood outside my front door at 3am whispering my name and sending me paragraphs about how he wanted to \"practice having sex\" with me \"because we are best friends\" and he \"felt like I would give him feedback\" *WHAT THE FUCK!?* \\- Guess what - the college only asked him to change classes. That's it. The Dean told me they would kick him out of the college, expel him from classes that semester or ask him to change his classes. I had to tell all my professors on my own because the college didn't have my back. He even showed up in NY when I moved after college, and I moved across the country.....I finally got rid of him when I moved from NY.\n\nThere was a guy in college who raped me because I was too drunk to drive home one night. He offered his bed and he slept on the couch until he joined me in bed later that night. I woke up and he was having sex with me. I remember he noticed I woke up and put a condom on. I was frozen. I didn't know what to do. I left when I could see the sun was coming up. I wouldn't talk to him and he acted like he didn't know what was wrong. He'd even send me texts if he was on the same bus to tell me he was behind me. I'm still confused by that.\n\nI'm sorry I spilled this mess here. I have a lot in my head and I don't know how to get it out. I have no one to talk to. No one understands unless they've had these things happen. I'm tired of sharing with someone I feel I can share with and they tell me they don't believe me, or ghost me completely. I had began to keep it all to myself for a few years in college and now I'm busting at the seams with flashbacks and panic attacks. I had a flashback when I was skiing with my husband this year. My father did things to me once when he was teaching me to ski as a kid. I was in the trees and it all came back. I don't know how to talk to my husband about these things. He doesn't understand. He means well and he's good to me, but he will never understand what I feel and what happened to me. I've never been able to really heal from any of this and I'm just now remembering things. I feel like a pile of used, damaged crap. I'm in a new city now, and I don't have any close friends here. I feel lonely and these flashbacks have affected my social abilities. I'm always on edge and I just thought I could share on here and someone might be able to tell me I'm not crazy and that I'm not bad for what happened. I feel I am though.", "displayed_text": "PTSD and digitizing childhood vhs tapes Hi, I need to talk about this because I don't have anyone I'm comfortable sharing with.\n\nI am going to bring up a couple things that I'm struggling with and share some background so this makes sense. I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.\n\nI realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.\n\n**Background**\n\nGrowing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she \"made it to where I didn't have to testify\". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.\n\nI had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by \"quickly and physically ending the disagreement\". After hearing that I got out of his car, said \"goodbye\" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for \"leaving\" them.\n\n**The Videos**\n\nI started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought \"Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first.\" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled \"1996\" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying \"no\" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?\n\nI was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from \"1996\" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks \"right?\" to my sister and she says something like \"only mom and dad think \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is a brat.\" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.\n\nI gave myself a couple days after that footage.
