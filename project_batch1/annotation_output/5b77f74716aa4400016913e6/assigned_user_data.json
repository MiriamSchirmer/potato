Now, I'm not going to say she was wrong. These were years ago. More than a decade. Nearly two decades in one instance. And every time you remember something, you make an imperfect photocopy of it. My perception, built up over the years as I somehow drifted further and further from my parents, may not be perfect.\n\nShe then went on to ask me if I remembered one time that she definitely did hit me - I said I didn't. She explains an instance where she slapped me, because I was misbehaving, and she was mortified afterwards. 'See, you're remembering it wrong, it's all made up.' I felt like we were approaching something, because at least here she was admitting, of her own accord, to some wrongdoing.\n\nThen, she said 'It was probably even just the shock of it then, I didn't hurt you.'

I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I know it's gonna be long. I apologize in advance. \nI was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically. \nMy mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us. He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake. I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react. \nHis mini van hits us right on my door. I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state. \nIt happened exactly like it does in the movies. In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself. I expected the car to just stop. I keep replaying that moment in my head. Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window. The window shatters on me, the airbag goes off, my door caves in on me. Everything goes red then a pale orange. \nOur car spins what feels like a million times and when we stop everything smells like smoke. I hear screaming and it takes me a while to realize it's me screaming. My mom gets out before I even realize we've stopped moving. I can't get out, my door is caved in. I feel like the car is going to explode and I can't do anything. I'm sure that I'm going to be set on fire. My whole face feels wet and I notice blood dripping onto my jacket. I can't open my right eye. Maybe I was just too scared. I don't know. My mom pulls me out of the car from the drivers side. \nFrom the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming. One woman, who I later learned had medical training of some sort, got a clean towel from her house and put it over my eye. Her daughter was on the phone with 911. She was trying to help me breathe but I was hysterical. I ask if everyone in the other car is okay.

The general consensus is that I'm very lucky I didn't die. I have lost about 6 of my old classmates to car accidents alone this year. \nOn one hand, I do feel lucky. I should've been in worse shape. On the other hand, to be honest, most days I wake up, I wished it killed me. I feel like I'm trapped in my own life now. Being in cars now is suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box underwater.

I obsess over everything I can't control now. Natural disasters, house fires, accidents of any kind.

Maybe hear similar stories. I've been trying to not talk about it too much to my friends and family because it was traumatic for them, too, and I'm sure they're sick of hearing about it. I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I know it's gonna be long. I apologize in advance. \nI was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically. \nMy mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us. He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake. I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react. \nHis mini van hits us right on my door. I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state. \nIt happened exactly like it does in the movies. In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself. I expected the car to just stop. I keep replaying that moment in my head. Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window. The window shatters on me, the airbag goes off, my door caves in on me. Everything goes red then a pale orange. \nOur car spins what feels like a million times and when we stop everything smells like smoke. I hear screaming and it takes me a while to realize it's me screaming. My mom gets out before I even realize we've stopped moving. I can't get out, my door is caved in. I feel like the car is going to explode and I can't do anything. I'm sure that I'm going to be set on fire. My whole face feels wet and I notice blood dripping onto my jacket. I can't open my right eye. Maybe I was just too scared. I don't know. My mom pulls me out of the car from the drivers side. \nFrom the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming.
