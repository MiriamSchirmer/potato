I don't like going into details about this but when I was 15/16 my school friend went missing (we had a very small school, maybe 10 people per class? It was for ppl with mental health problems I had/have pretty severe depression and anxiety) it was just when we had finished secondary school so lots of us assumed she'd ran away from home. She hadn't and her body parts were later found and her step brother arrested for it.\nAfter this I completely shut myself off from my friends, I didn't even talk to my therapist about it (I was with CAMHS) I didn't let myself be sad about it at all. Now that I'm 20 i feel like everything reminds me of it. I can't watch anything true crime/murder related without feeling weird and everything remind me of what happened. Even GoT has been a bit much with beheadings etc... And I know I could just avoid watching stuff like that completely but you'd be surprised how often murder comes up in basically any TV show. I can't deal with dissociating everytime I think about it and see something that makes me think about it. I don't know what to do, I'm already on medication for my depression /anxiety (100mg sertraline). I just feel like I can't talk to anyone about it because not only is it horrible for me people never know what to say.\nAgain sorry if this is the wrong place to put this, all in all I'm just asking if anyone has coping methods for certain triggers I guess?"}, "1215_ptsd": {"id": "1215_ptsd", "text": "Forcing myself to throw up Hello.

It is how both of my parents have always been, and I feel like I'm doomed to that life also. It makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because I\u2019m too nice. It causes me depression and brings me down.

I'm diagnosed with depression, general anxiety and ocd and take medication. I've had very brief therapy experience and am not currently in therapy but I'm wondering if I should see someone about the possibility of trauma. Sorry if this is a long one but here we go. \n\nAs a child I had a debilitating chronic illness which came on very suddenly and meant I had to leave school and I became bedbound with a lot of pain and mystery symptoms. 'Suddenly' as in my life changed basically overnight. Took a loooong time to diagnose too. I was never admitted to hospital long term but did an extensive pediatric tour and being a kid, didn't really know what was happening, if I'd ever get better, etc. and became almost totally isolated from all my old friends too. I also saw the effect my illness had on my family which was really rough. I've been depressed since childhood but only sought help at age 20 because as a kid I was scared if any doctors knew cps would take me away (reports of kids with depression + my condition being wrongly perceived as a result of abuse) plus I didn't want to cause more pain to my family... Then the secret had been kept too long to spill I guess. I'd always been an anxious child too. I also don't remember much of my childhood but I don't know if there's an abnormal lack of memories. \n\nI get angry hearing other people with the illness talk about it... I panic and get upset when I think about how I was... The times I've been forced into talking about it/remembering being ill I get very emotional... No one who I've made friends with after getting better knows about my illness and I plan to keep it that way. But I've only heard of medical trauma in like, kids who had cancer or really serious stuff. I don't know if this is a trauma or I'm just oversensitive? and I feel like I can't even tell how much this is affecting my life if that makes sense because I don't want to think about it. I'm used to being extremely repressed but finding the right snri has made more actual emotions creep back into my life lol.
