I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up.

Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go.

But thats what is getting back to me now cause I dont have a healthy view on how to get better.\n\n\n\n\nAs you see Im constantly questioning myself, I just dont know what would be appropriate for someone in my situation. How do you guys handle this stuff? What do you do to get productive and how do you handle the stress of a deadline when there is so much going on in your head? Have you taken a longer time of work to deal with your mental health and how did that work out?\n\nThank you so much for reading this, I am very new to all this and its a bit of a thing for me to ask advice cause it means admitting I need help.

I initially started going because I felt like I generally needed support with being almost entirely closeted outside of the net and needing help with getting the support of my parents.

She's on leave right now.\n\nI ended up describing some difficulties I was having with relationships and even just general socialising and it lead to us doing the adult attachment interview. In the course of that, I was describing stuff with my parents. I described some particular incidents where I remembered being pushed against a hard plastic prop in a theme park when I was a kid, another when my mother screamed at me and threw my own shoes at me, and another where I remembered her grabbing me, spinning me around and shoving me onto a curb before storming away. In each of these instances, I had been annoying them prior in some fashion, or misbehaving. There's probably a few others, but those stood out.\n\nI told my therapist about how I would remember these events, rather vividly, every few weeks or so and that the more I talked about my parents over the sessions - which took some effort, as I would avoid the subject earlier on - the more frequently I thought about them. And apparently that, uh...apparently that's not normal? Prior, I had just assumed it was normal to keep remembering stuff like that. We got to the end of the interview, over the course of 3 sessions because I kept crying during it. High on anxiety, high on avoidance. Congratulations. It's a Fearful-Avoidant.\n\nWe continued talking about these things, still do. It was the first time someone referred to what I went through as incidences of abuse. I would always just say to myself, before this, that I couldn't have been abused because my parents cared about me, or it didn't count as abuse because it was inconsistent, because I was never routinely or ritualistically beaten, or that it didn't count because I deserved it.\n\nA few weeks ago, my mother accused me of disrespecting her after not responding to some asinine suggestion. I ended up being made to sit in front of my parents and made to tell them why I will talk about things to a therapist without telling them. So I was upfront about it - 'you have a history of treating me with anger and violence'.\n\nI was immediately met with incredulity. I was made to outline the events. I named them. One of them - the shoes - she said she didn't remember.  Two others - spinning me around and put to the curb, and being shoved against a prop at Legoland - she says I was misremembering. The former, she just pushed me away because I was being (her words) 'such a horrid thing', the latter, she says I fell and they were helping me up (I have cerebral palsy, balance issues - results in overprotective helicopter parents, to boot). Now, I'm not going to say she was wrong. These were years ago. More than a decade. Nearly two decades in one instance. And every time you remember something, you make an imperfect photocopy of it. My perception, built up over the years as I somehow drifted further and further from my parents, may not be perfect.\n\nShe then went on to ask me if I remembered one time that she definitely did hit me - I said I didn't. She explains an instance where she slapped me, because I was misbehaving, and she was mortified afterwards. 'See, you're remembering it wrong, it's all made up.' I felt like we were approaching something, because at least here she was admitting, of her own accord, to some wrongdoing.\n\nThen, she said 'It was probably even just the shock of it then, I didn't hurt you.' My face fell. She admits to actually hitting me once, then justifies it with simultaneous 'you deserved it' and 'it wasn't even a real hit'.\n\nThat's the thing that kept me grounded. That wasn't okay. It wasn't okay to justify it. It wasn't okay to effectively corner me and make me spill the beans over what's going on in therapy because I'm seen as property.

What if I'm remembering it a certain, innaccurate way, and it's colouring my perception of everything else?\n\nEven if my memories are wrong, though, the effects are there. I struggle with relationships. In bad days I dread getting up and seeing my parents. I feel anxious at mealtimes when I have to be near them. I am very apprehensive about the notion of going on vacation with them. I had trouble talking about them in therapy and when my therapist suggested a roleplay for tackling a subject, I just locked up and couldn't do it. That shit just doesn't come from nowhere, right?

First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time.

First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce.

And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   \n\nI injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  \n\nWell the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  \n\nLuckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. \n\nI looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) \n\n When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  \n\nI went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a \"cookie cutter\" plan.\n\nThey explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. \n\nAfter going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  \n\nThey truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  \n\nThey also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    \n\nWith their help I have been clean 3.5 months.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. \n\nSo today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.\n\nFor the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.

And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   \n\nI injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  \n\nWell the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  \n\nLuckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. \n\nI looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) \n\n When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  \n\nI went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a \"cookie cutter\" plan.\n\nThey explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. \n\nAfter going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  \n\nThey truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  \n\nThey also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    \n\nWith their help I have been clean 3.5 months.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. \n\nSo today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.\n\nFor the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future....
