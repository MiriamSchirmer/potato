{"id": "1664_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Experiencing flashbacks and dissociation? Hi, my name is Liz and I'm a 30 year old woman with a lot of past trauma. Specifically, most of the trauma happened when I was a child living with parents who were abusive to one another and myself. I seem to be having flashbacks to things that have happened in my current relationship though. My partner likes to drink and I do not. I have no problem with anyone drinking around me, it's just that I don't find pleasure in it myself. He has acted in very scary and mean ways while drinking, and even though it has been over a year since he has done anything like this, I seem to be having issues. I lay in bed and sometimes have memories (that prior I didn't remember, or hadn't thought of in a long time) and they feel real. For example: he screamed in my face one time, and I had a memory of it the other night. I felt his voice causing my whole body to shake and rattle. I felt my life being possibly threatened. It took quite some time to shake the residual feelings and go to sleep. \n\nAfter experiencing the flashbacks, or experiencing something he has done, I tend to dissociate. At least I think it's dissociation. I actually welcome it and LIKE the feeling. I just kind of go away. I can't see what's in front of me or hear what people say. I go on autopilot or just stare into nothingness. It almost feels like maybe I'm going cross-eyed, lol. But no one has confirmed this for me. Although, as a child, my teachers would accuse me of \"daydreaming\" all the time. I would try to explain to my mom that I wasn't \"thinking\" of anything. I was just in a daze. She said, well whatever it is, just cut it out, lol. \n\nI like this feeling of being numb or calm and unaware. Is that unusual? Are these signs of PTSD? I really am not sure and just looking for some answers and possibly some people out there who are going through the same.  Most of the time I hear people describe dissociation as an unwanted or unpleasant thing. So, I'm a little confused as to why I welcome the sensation. (Most of the time, unless I'm trying to do something important)\n\nI really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I hope you are doing well during these difficult times.

I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. Like my mother fucking pINCHED HER ARM and held it as tight as she could when she wasn\u2019t walking fast enough to her liking at a gas station. I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn\u2019t until I said something that she stopped. I think it\u2019s just because I\u2019m an adult now and she knows she can\u2019t scare me into shutting up when I see something shitty. \n\nNot even the worse part of the day? For me at least. Poor N probably is just tired of feeling like everything she does is wrong. Maybe I\u2019m projecting. I don\u2019t think so though. \n\nWe were out to eat with S who I haven\u2019t talked to in months. I texted her months ago when I was in a deep depression and basically went off on her about the dent in the back of my skull. It wasn\u2019t a lot. We were in an argument when I was probably 16. I turned around to walk away and she grabbed a can of food and just started hitting me over and over again in the back of my head. It hurts to this day. Every time I think about it I cry. \n\nANYWAY, out at dinner. First time I\u2019ve seen in S in months. M has convinced me to try and mend the relationship. I start off by saying I\u2019m sorry. I was immature about the way I went things and I should of just tried to talk to her about it because she\u2019s my sister and I love her. The entire time I\u2019m saying all this she\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m the most disgusting person on the planet. I finally stop and ask if everything is okay. Honestly I don\u2019t even remember what she said. It\u2019s fucking cliche but it\u2019s literally all a blur. This always happens. Whatever she said is just not even a memory. Whenever I\u2019m in conflict of any kind I can\u2019t remember what was said. My body like shuts down. I can barely hear my own thoughts. My vision has blurred in and out before. Lately when I\u2019m panicking I can\u2019t hear anything. It\u2019s scary. I don\u2019t know if these are symptoms. I got diagnosed with PTSD and haven\u2019t been back to the doctor since. It\u2019s fucking terrifying. \n\nI remember what I said before I walked out of the restaurant. Something shitty about her creepy ass boyfriend? (I only feel this way about him because he tried to fuck me when I was 16 and he was 20. She knew this. Is now living with him) \n\nI just stood at the back of the restaurant and trembled. I called my husband and just balled and asked him to pick me up. Felt like 5 minutes had passed but it\u2019d been 20.  My mom texted me my niece was upset so I went back in because I honestly hate that she even witnessed this disfunction.  \n\nI don\u2019t even know anymore. I just miss my family, but I hate them. I\u2019ve had so many traumatic experiences in my life and almost all of them (including being molested) were caused by FAMILY. It fucks with me.

{"id": "1469_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Suffering Suffering, Losing My Twin Brother TLDR: Fill your well of sorrow with natural, wholesome joys.\n\nThis story is tragic, and I\u2019m omitting personal details for a lot of reasons, but my experience is, in sharing my story, that others have found solace. Last summer, after a family event/argument led to domestic violence at home, I decided to move out of the house, where I was living with my twin brother. He had suffered from depression for most of his life, but towards the end, he became increasingly violent and manic. I was scared, and confused, and did what I thought was best for me and my partner at the time, and moved down the street to a new apt. The next day, after working, and not hearing from him, I started to get a sick feeling in my stomach. I ignored it for a few hours, drinking water and laying down, but the sick feeling grew into something else that I can\u2019t describe. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard stories of twins sensing each other, especially in times of distress. It\u2019s rare, but I\u2019m telling you, that shit is very real. So I walked over to our house, and he didn\u2019t answer the door. It was a Tuesday night. He was 32. We were 32.\n\nMy actual experience is something too horrible and sad to describe in detail, but I did find him, and I\u2019m the one who went in, and raised him up, and took him off of that rope. That tangible, physical experience, mixed with the tragedy of losing my twin brother, my best friend, who I spent my entire childhood with, has left me deeply traumatized. There\u2019s an element to it that took part of my identity itself, as a twin, I\u2019m now now longer part of a set. I\u2019m half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How do I continue to be a twin without my match? Is a set still a set, once you apply subtraction? Am I still a twin now that he is gone?\n\nMy trauma experience is a nightmare, literally. My dreams manifest things I don\u2019t even want to go into, and I\u2019ve never been so aware of how many times suicide is mentioned in films, television, even comedy. It\u2019s everywhere, and the suicide rates among young people are at unprecedented levels. My triggers induce a deep breath in me, at the mention of the word, or image, or a roped off front yard, Dad attempting to make the grass grow. Or a bread tie. Or a dog collar. It\u2019s weird how things manifest like that. Unfortunately the mystery leaves me vulnerable to crying episodes in public, or leaving social gatherings early, and unannounced. I attempted to continue to suck it up, and be social, but my loss made me nervous, confused, empty. It left me empty. But, like the dry chalice might be considered to be empty, perhaps the purpose of the chalice, is to be filled. And so it flows into me...\n\nIt taught me to see truth a little clearer, but this has been hard. Truth requires self reflection first, self truth, whatever that means to you. I had to look hard at myself in order to deal with my grief and my guilt, and I know I\u2019ll struggle to understand these issues for the rest of my life. I\u2019ve been writing and reading about suicide, bipolar disorder (which he had), consciousness, empathy, truth, friendships, spirituality, and sorrow to try to process all of this. \n\nI never could have imagined being in this place, on this island. At first, many were supportive, but slowly I became more and more isolated, feeling like no one possibly could understand what I was going through. I slowly lost most of the people in my life, not because they didn\u2019t care, but because they didn\u2019t have the capacity to show it, they just didn\u2019t know how. Who could blame them? I was confrontational, angry, sad, confused, and hoping someone was going to make it better for me. But it wasn\u2019t about anyone else, if I was going to ever feel good again, it was going to be ME who made that happen. It\u2019s amazing how everything can turn on a dime, and never return. It\u2019s like, when he died, he took this..  thing... from me. What it is, I can\u2019t name, but it\u2019s gone for sure, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not coming back. So what do I do with it, this emptiness? I walk with it. Literally. I walk and walk the trails on this island all day. It\u2019s winter now, so it\u2019s much colder, and my walks are filled with less pauses, but I persist. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy, sometimes several times a week. I do not consume alcohol or hard drugs. I use particular psychedelics with a therapeutic intent, and have experienced profound revelations that have been helpful in moving my mind in a more conscious and positive direction. I take natural herbal supplements for energy and mood balancing, but I find that exercising in a natural environment is the best thing for me therapeutically. I\u2019m lucky to be young enough to be so mobile. \n\nI\u2019ve slowly shed all social media, FB, IG, etc, because I found it to contribute to my anxiety, my isolation, and resentment. I was constantly trying to openly share, self examine, and had hopes that others would reciprocate. But people don\u2019t really want to do that. It\u2019s super uncomfortable, and most would rather be distracted by the game, or their phone, or a drink. Finally, after a point in which I felt like what I was saying fell on deaf ears, I decided to no longer share with those who couldn\u2019t hear it anymore. My therapist brought to mind the biblical concept \u201ccast ye your pearls before swine\u201d.  Of course I\u2019m not saying my words are gospel, and in fact, I offer no advice to anyone, this is all purely my experience and expression. \n\nIn fact, I\u2019m in distress a lot, and I\u2019m not saying that any of this made me a \u201cbetter person\u201d, I\u2019m saying it made me wake the fuck up to myself, and what I was doing. Things don\u2019t get easier, they just get different. Tragedy sometime can birth strength, but often times, tragic events do not make people better, stronger, or more aware, in fact it often makes us more disconnected, more isolated, feeling like we\u2019re unique, and our pain is unique. Victims of trauma can\u2019t be put into order in a filing cabinet, there\u2019s no sense to be made of it. Some are resentful of those thriving, saying \u201cthat\u2019s not my experience\u201d. Of course it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just yours. And this is just mine. And although my situation and personality are unique, I find my pain isn\u2019t. The whole world is suffering suffering. My pain might just disappear, like a drop becomes the ocean, in the great vastness of collective consciousness, if I can release myself of the burden through empathy. Might any of us be strong enough to let the ocean completely envelop us? \n\nSo it\u2019s been a few weeks now since I\u2019ve been free from Instagram and Facebook, and my urge to check a screen, my addiction to check in on these carefully manicured presentations of digital life, has faded. Leaving me again, more room to be filled with the good things I enjoy in life. Playing my guitar, and reading Melville in the bathtub, meditating outside, walking the sandy trails with the rabbits, listening to my favorite records, and most importantly, spending time with my loving and compassionate partner, who is the most selfless, understanding soul in my whole world. Without love, I would have perished along with my brother, but it\u2019s love that kept me alive, and keeps me going. If I can learn to love myself truly, I know I\u2019ll survive. \n\nI hope to someday find a way to have a PTSD service dog, although it seems unlikely, due to the cost of training one properly (about $20K). I absolutely love dogs, and I think about adopting one frequently, but again, it\u2019s so hard for me to initiate important things, I can\u2019t even imagine starting this process. A good friend of mine has a couple hounds who love me, and make me super happy, so sometimes, when I\u2019m really down, I just go lay on the floor over at his house, and let the dogs go to town licking me and climbing all over me. It\u2019s so sensational and wonderful, I smile just writing about it. A pure, simple, wholesome joy. \n\nI\u2019m not past the pain, I\u2019m just finding out better ways in which to navigate it. Some days, the seas are choppy, but at least the sails are full. The shores of the seas of my mental landscape, are lined by a great, \u201cmental forest\u201d. My twin brother was a great tree in my forest, and hard he fell, but that break in the canopy has given my forest new growth. Exotic species sprout from the sunlit patch spontaneously, and they invite me in, and we become one, and I enjoy the sun with them while I can. \n\nAre you in pain?

First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to \"listen to her point of view because she had listened to me.\" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our \"conversation.\" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.\n\nAt some point in this \"conversation\" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say \"No\" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said \"nice talking to you guys.\" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.\n\nIn the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way \"there\".  \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways.

My mom committed suicide. Do not pity her. She did this specifically to screw with me, that's how vindictive she was after years of physical and then more years after that of emotional and verbal abuse. I took it and did it proudly because it protected my little brother and I would do it again 50 times over. When my mom went absolutely insane a couple years before her death, I took care of everything, she was in jail, I visited her I would say every week except missing when I was too sick with migraines to drive or with bad roads. Anytime I missed I could expect a letter about how much she hated me. After she was divorced I stored all her things in the basement. I let her have unlimited access, she stole from me. She liked to torture me over suicide with multiple failed attempts and asking if I had her stepladder only to after me giving it to her have her text me about how she was about to kill herself, knowing I would be there because it was my duty. Her last day alive, she asked for access to her things, said that was fine but I was at work so it would probably have to wait for the weekend, she proceeded to tell me how awful a daughter I was, deserving of hell, how much she hated me etc. I told her (finally) to get over herself, she hung herself that night while I was searching for her. \n\n\nAfter, I thought I had to be the matriarch. I had to be strong for everyone, including my brother. So at 22 I planned my first funeral 7 days after my 22nd birthday and 7 days before Christmas.
