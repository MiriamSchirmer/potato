My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I\u2019ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they\u2019d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn\u2019t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. \n\nWhen I was 18 (I\u2019m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.\n\nOn my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me. We met up and drove around, hung out at his place and divulged in deep conversations for hours on end. \n\nAfter a couple of times he became very flirtatious and made a pass at me. \nI was pretty sexually inexperienced and he knew that, in hindsight I feel as though  he fetishized my innocence (he casually) brought it up countless times. When we first started hooking  up , it was pretty vanilla and ..normal I guess.\n\n\nOvertime he began to become really aggressive and rough , he was kind of coercive and disregarded some of my boundaries. He would choke me so hard to where I would run out of air and the next day my neck would be riddled with bruises (I was okay with choking but not that extreme). I have a visceral memory of how dark and sinister his eyes looked while he would do this. \n\nOn one occasion he did something  I did NOT consent too and it really upset me, I consented you\u2019re sex but not what he did in the midst of it(I don\u2019t feel comfortable being less vague ) it wasn\u2019t I\u2019ve isolated thing, but during that instance I remember spacing out until it was over with..was paralyzed and couldn\u2019t think.

{"id": "2036_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Could I have PTSD? Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.\n\nSo after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.\n\nAs I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.\n\n\nSo here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:\n\nSome years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.\n\nAll this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.\n\nThen after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.\n\nSome time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.\n\nBefore all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.\n\nNow after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. \n\nSo my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1467, "end": 1597, "span": "We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups.

{"id": "2271_ptsd", "displayed_text": "My parents actively kept me from getting the help I needed early on and the anger and resentment are eating me alive Not getting into details aside from the fact that my PTSD is CSA-related. I never told my parents (that I remember, it happened when I was 5-6 and my parents have always treated me like a dramatic liar so maybe I did tell them and forgot)\n\nLast year (I was 25 or 26) my mother told me that when I was a child I used to be happy and curious and full of life, and that it suddenly changed \"for no reason\". I have no memories of ever having been anything other than a sad, sometimes angry child. She can be quite abusive emotionally so I'm not really sure what she wanted me to take away from that, it felt a little accusatory like she believes 5 year-old-me decided to become bitter just to flex on her.\n\nIt reminded me of when I was 13 and I went to a doctor for my insomnia. After talking with her and testing a few things she wanted to talk to my parents so they came with me to the next appointment. he told them that there seemed to be no physical problem but from our conversation she could tell that I probably needed therapy. My father basically told her that I was a dramatic idiot who made things up for attention and we left.\n\nNow the trauma is resurfacing, new memories are coming and I can barely function. Not to mention the added trauma of having grown up without effective coping mechanisms and the abusive relationship I got into and stayed into because I didn't know I was a human being who deserved to be treated as such. I'm so angry and I can't stop thinking about where I would be now if they had allowed me to get help 14 years ago, or better yet 22 years ago when they noticed something had drastically changed.\n\nI don't know what I want by posting this, feels good to get it off my chest among people who can understand.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 611, "end": 649, "span": " She can be quite abusive emotionally ", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 32s "}}
