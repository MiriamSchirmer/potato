C honestly never cared about any of us and just wanted our fully devoted attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm 21 now living in a different country and this happened to me when i was around 13/14 yrs old. i was at a party with a friend and we and a couple others had a sleep over together afterwards. the next morning i awoke to my friend (let's call her C) lightly caressing my private part down below. i thought i just had morning wood and ignored it until i was certain it was actually C doing it. i didn't really know what to do i mean i was never taught about sex (due to our school system failing us) and it felt sort of good but also sort of weird. this went on for about 20 min. and then i held her hand and C put her hand down my pants and did things for a bit then abruptly stopped. C had a partner and C told me C felt like C cheated and i reassured C that it was ok and that we don't have to talk about it ever again and we can pretend it didn't happen and this relieved C.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthen a couple of years later i decide to end it with some of the people in the group, including C, because they're toxic. C then, after telling her this, tells me that I r\\*ped her that night and told everyone imaginable that i was some rapist monster. everyone shunned me and i was completely alone. C told their relatives and they wanted to talk so then i told my parents and it was the most embarassing thing to have to explain. we eventually moved away and i'm starting to find peace but being told i r\\*ped somebody when really i was the one who was sexually and mentally taken advantage of has given me severe PTSD (i've seen a therapist about this for about a year now) and also developed into a host of other problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe biggest problem i have is that i fear so much to go out in public. i fear that everyone knows and thinks i'm disgusting and ontop of all that i feel disgusting. my body was basically used and thrown away by C and even after C did this to me and told the school i was a r\\*pist, one of our mututal friends who still talked to me told me C said that i \"had a nice d\\*ck\" like what the fuck. i feel so much shame and  violated, uneasy, disgusting, etc. and i've felt like this for almost the majority of my life now because i had no way to cope with it or deal with it healthily until seeing a therapist recently. i feel so damaged and i blame myself honestly for even getting into that situation to begin with. i wish i could've gotten away but it seems like C will always loom over me and have power over me because C is a \"victim...\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif anyone has any helpful advice of how i can move past this please help. it's becoming unbearable to deal with. thank you and sorry for the long, drawn out story", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 700, "end": 745, "span": "lightly caressing my private part down below.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1526, "span": "ells me that I r\\*ped he", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1599, "span": " rapist monster.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1967, "span": "eing told i r\\*ped somebody when really i was the one who was sexually and mentally taken advantage of has given me severe PTSD", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2358, "end": 2465, "span": "i was a r\\*pist, one of our mututal friends who still talked to me told me C said that i \"had a nice d\\*ck\"", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2502, "end": 2542, "span": "hame and  violated, uneasy, disgusting, ", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 44s "}}

This is my first time in a while posting in a forum about this. I was pretty badly beaten for a few years by a partner. I have monthly nightmares about him throwing things at me, cursing at me and threatening me with objects, he did much more but for some reason I usually just dream about the anger and intimidation prior to the actual acts themselves. I think because it was that stage that lasted the longest (an hour or two), it hurt me more mentally than the usual 30 seconds to a minute of when he did hurt me physically, Idk maybe easier to block out than the awful screaming and personal attacks.\nI also get nightmares of the cheating and of being an inadequate woman. \n\nI also have noticed I tend to flinch pretty dramatically when things are thrown or tossed at me when I'm unaware. My depression and anxiety have gotten so bad and I started seeing a counselor last year, and started medication. I've gained  20-30 pounds because i just feel like it's pointless to care about my appearance half the time, my self confidence is really jacked up now. I use to be such a happy person. I always had depression and anxiety but it feels amplified now. It's like I just have a pit in my stomach all the time.\n\n I use to wear fun dresses and high heels. I use to go on spontaneous adventures. I use to be so carefree and trusting. I'm a fat shell of who I use to be, and it really hurts me when people bring up how fun I use to be. I don't like being unfun, but it's been so hard to dig myself out. I also have 2 young kids which doen't help either lol. I do try,  I try to self care and do what use to make me happy but it just doesn't work.\n\nI recently started therapy and meds for depression and anxiety and it took a few visits to bring it up , I felt dismissed , she said \"he was young\". No I wasn't talking to you to fucking justify it but being on state health insurance it's hard to find good ones out of the few approved therapists in your area. \n\nShit when I told my separate doctor that prescribes them that my anxiety didn't feel any better she only had 1 other med to try and then basically said if that didn't work then I just wont have an anxiety medicine that works for me.

Hopefully someone can help or at least understand what I'm struggling with.\nI've been through major trauma 8 years ago, as I was walking home from school a man attacked me. He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.\nHe eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.\nWhat followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. \nI've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.\nMy family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). \nI couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.\n\nI kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost. I couldn't hold memories for a while and if you ask me about my last year in high school it's pretty confusing, I just remember parts and not in order. Depression, anxiety, fear or strangers, panic attacks and dissociation would come and go. \nSometimes I'd just not feel anything, and sometimes I'd be angry at people for not understanding me.\nI started doing therapy and slowly healing but still found it hard to deal with my emotions.\n\nEventually, I went to this Buddhist temple and started meditating, which really helped me and brought me back to reality. I stopped having panick attacks and was able to not think about it so much.\nGoing to college also helped, cause it felt like a new stage of life and I quit therapy because I felt no need to keep going.\n\nNow, I've been doing pretty well in my life and most of the time don't even think about what happened. But the other day I read on the news about a 3 year old who was sexually abused, she was found with her diaper full of blood. Just typing this makes my eyes well up.\nI can't stop thinking about that, about how fucked up the world is, and keep having flashbacks of what happened to me. It's making me depressed, affecting my relationships, my sex life and daily life.\nI'm living far from my family, and I don't wanna tell them what's going on because they will just feel upset and powerless.\nI try to forgive myself for not doing anything like running or kicking him, or just paying more attention because I didn't even see him approach me.. \nI guess now I'm just having a mix of emotions, I don't wanna live in the past but I'm not feeling connected to the present no matter how hard I try.\n\nI feel very lonely because the people who love me can't really understand my feelings and I know they hurt too, but in a different way. I feel helpless.\nI'm not even sure this is just PTSD or something else, if there is anything I can or should do... \n\nThank you for reading.

{"id": "2142_ptsd", "displayed_text": "What am I actually supposed to do? Early years: Removed from school/kept from people by age 8, endured emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, medical neglect, exposure to domestic violence, exposure to police raids/arrests, exposure to drugs including meth, exposure to alcohol abuse, made to take care of fetal alcohol syndrome children while myself a child, exposure to dangerous/drunk/high driving, experienced multiple car accidents including one that resulted in the car catching fire, witnessed other people being abused, witnessed animals being abused, threatened with abuse of other people/animals to gain compliance, forced to stay in an evacuation/disaster area during a hurricane, made to do lots of manual labor/farm work, periodically not allowed to sleep at night and made to \"stand watch\", etc. etc. etc. Never taken by CPS somehow. Texas also does not care if children are or are not in school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2016: The hellhouse explodes in the middle of the night while I'm inside, catches fire, and burns down. No insurance. Bunch of animals die. Sad. Those were basically my only friends. I run away in the middle of the night and don't tell my family. Got 850 miles away. Drove from South Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, to Eastern Nebraska in two days. Stayed in my car. Stayed on the couch of someone I only knew from the internet. Rented a room in a house with strange guys from craigslist. Got screwed out of that and given the wrong date for move out. Had to leave asap. Rented a room in another house sight unseen. Hoarder lady. Cat shit in a room. No cat. Doors don't lock on the house. Random people show up and drop things off for my landlady. I have no idea who they are, they just walk in and leave shit. Can't find/afford anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2017: Finally manage enough money for an apartment. Worked 6 days a week. Worked sick. Get apartment. Calm down. Have safe/private space. Hate Nebraska though. Feel anxious. Tornadoes in the summer. Hail every spring. Ice/snow in winter. Icy roads I'm not used to driving on. Scared of the environment all the time. Car engine dies that fall. Sink my savings into having to buy another car off craigslist. Can't afford to be without a car. Had gotten a better paying job at a call center during this year, but still struggling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2018: Start trying to recover savings. That fall apartment building gets struck by lightning while I'm inside. Lightning. It also burns down. Insurance doesn't cover everything. Now in debt. God is pursuing me with fire. Reality isn't real. I am destined to die. I am being pursued. Something is after me. Why is this happening again? Brain goes to space world. Resume brief homelessness and stress of recovering after fire #2. Red cross offers no help to even transport me anywhere because I have 2 dogs. My phone is in the burned building. I have no family or friends nearby. I don't even have shoes on. Mental state falls apart. Can't take time off work long due to money. Cause problems with boss/at work due to emotional instability/unwillingness to take a schedule change. Boss says I should bring him a doctors note saying I have problems after I oversleep one day due to having a panic attack the night prior. Ignores that he gets medical insurance in this company and I don't. Tells me he thought he had been very lenient by letting me have 5 days off after the fire. Never get doctor's note. Live in fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2019: A chaotic mess. I want to leave Nebraska so bad. I am scared all the time. I am scared every time it rains/storms. I am scared every time a machine in the wall hums weirdly. I am scared when I hear sirens or alarms and sometimes mistake phone rings and stuff for them. I hallucinate smoke when I walk into rooms sometimes. I am scared when I have to drive, and terrified when it is in snow. I am scared of my bosses. I am scared of losing my job. I am scared of calling in when flashbacks and panic attacks interrupt sleep. I am scared of becoming homeless again. I am scared of wasting time feeling miserable only to die before anything gets better. I am indignant and frustrated that I cannot motivate myself to try any harder to get out of here. I am angry I do not have any parents to fall back on or ask for help or money. I am angry there is no way for me to easily get to Oregon. I am angry I feel as tired as I do and people are still mean. I am angry my job doesn't give me insurance. I am angry I make too much for assistance despite how like a stupid feral child I am, but seemingly not enough to afford consistent care. Don't want to do call center work but don't know what else to do that I can survive on.

Diagnosed with PTSD 2 years ago. \n\nSo last night around 1am, I was in bed getting ready to sleep and I heard keys jangling outside my door, and I  just assumed it was my neighbours. I live in private student accommodation, so we have 24 hour security, I generally feel very safe. But then, after hearing these keys, my door began to open and a security guard walked in. I jumped out of bed to speak with him, apparently he'd had a noise complaint, my TV was on but it wasn't loud enough to be heard from where the complaint was, so he apologised for disturbing me and left. After he was gone I just broke down, it scared me so much\n\nThis morning I found out he filed a report himself because he's new to the job, and had thought that my flat was one with a communal living space, ie. A flat he would be allowed to enter without knocking. He had no idea he was walking into a studio flat, essentially my bedroom.\nI know that this guy made an honest mistake, I'm not upset about that. It just upset me so much to have someone walk into my space like that with no warning. I don't necessarily want to go into my PTSD diagnosis on this post, but I'm so shaken up by this event.\nI really don't feel like being in my apartment at all, and I can't sleep because I feel like someone could just walk in. I'm so on edge and I'm so tired. I feel like I'm overreacting, but when I think about it I start shaking. I just don't feel like anyone understands, so I guess that's why I'm here, I wanted to get it off my chest to people who would understand.\n\nSorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile and I'm pretty sleep deprived.
