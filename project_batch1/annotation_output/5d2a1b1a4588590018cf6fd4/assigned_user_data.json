When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.\n\nThe dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating.

I have monthly nightmares about him throwing things at me, cursing at me and threatening me with objects, he did much more but for some reason I usually just dream about the anger and intimidation prior to the actual acts themselves. I think because it was that stage that lasted the longest (an hour or two), it hurt me more mentally than the usual 30 seconds to a minute of when he did hurt me physically, Idk maybe easier to block out than the awful screaming and personal attacks.\nI also get nightmares of the cheating and of being an inadequate woman. \n\nI also have noticed I tend to flinch pretty dramatically when things are thrown or tossed at me when I'm unaware. My depression and anxiety have gotten so bad and I started seeing a counselor last year, and started medication. I've gained  20-30 pounds because i just feel like it's pointless to care about my appearance half the time, my self confidence is really jacked up now. I use to be such a happy person. I always had depression and anxiety but it feels amplified now. It's like I just have a pit in my stomach all the time.\n\n I use to wear fun dresses and high heels. I use to go on spontaneous adventures. I use to be so carefree and trusting. I'm a fat shell of who I use to be, and it really hurts me when people bring up how fun I use to be. I don't like being unfun, but it's been so hard to dig myself out. I also have 2 young kids which doen't help either lol. I do try,  I try to self care and do what use to make me happy but it just doesn't work.\n\nI recently started therapy and meds for depression and anxiety and it took a few visits to bring it up , I felt dismissed , she said \"he was young\". No I wasn't talking to you to fucking justify it but being on state health insurance it's hard to find good ones out of the few approved therapists in your area. \n\nShit when I told my separate doctor that prescribes them that my anxiety didn't feel any better she only had 1 other med to try and then basically said if that didn't work then I just wont have an anxiety medicine that works for me. (We've only tried 2 so far). \n\nI just wish I wasn't like this. I wish I never went through it,  I wish I could be who I was before everything.

I was clear with her of my goal for her in our relationship: to be happy and healthy.\n\nHer family life is almost non existent, and she has moved around most of her life. She severed ties with (some of) the abusive relationships in her life about 2 years ago. We moved in together because we spent most of our time together and we wanted to save money. It\u2019s been almost 2 years living together (after only 8-10 months of dating). Cracks are beginning to show.\n\nWe have two roommates, who I like very much. She always got along with them until recently. Our apartment is 2 couples, M-F / M-F. It\u2019s a two bedroom, so yes, it gets a little cramped, even though its a big place, one bathroom is a constant pest. \n\nLately (past 6 months), the girl living with us has made it clear about keeping things clean, using our own appliances.. usual passive-aggressive roommate stuff. I\u2019m used to it, I do NOT take it personally from the girl, we still chat in a very friendly way frequently, and I\u2019m good friends with her boyfriend. I see these grievances as small troubles, roommates setting boundaries, etc.\n\nWe have lived with this couple for the entirety of us living together. Problems just started to arise about 6 months ago. The girl would get pissed at messy bathroom, moldy stuff in fridge, etc. NEVER became vocal about these problems. Began to show some passive aggressive behavior: Slamming bathroom door, leaving notes, sending TWO texts, JUST TWO over a few months.\n\nI see this stuff as normal, my girlfriend is losing her mind. The slamming of bathroom doors led to her having flashbacks of her shitty father. I spoke with the roommate, and explained the situation. It stopped happening. The girl asked that my GF start using her own electric kettle due to overlapping morning schedules. My GF\u2019s electric kettle was given to her by one of her attackers at her last apartment. That was hard to explain to girl, so we gave it away to avoid more triggers for my girlfriend.\n\nNow, my girlfriend is being triggered by the girl loudly doing her own dishes. This, I had to make a stand on. They were not my gf\u2019s dishes. She had no dogs in the fight. Yet she blamed her INCREDIBLE anger where she stormed into our room and stayed for the night, on loud dish-doing. \n\nMy girlfriend is not a clean person. I can deal with it, try to get her to clean, but it is not my roommates\u2019 fault that she is this way. \n\nThe girl left a note on a tupperware container tonight saying \u2018PLEASE DISPOSE\u2019 and my girlfriend lost it. Inside? A month of veggie smoothie mix that had a lump of mold in it so large that I couldn\u2019t wash it down the sink, I had to pick it out and trash it.\n\nMy girlfriend? Threw a fit and LEFT IT OUT on the counter. Walked away from it. Meanwhile the moldy cup in the living room I asked her to clean will start a fight if I bring it up. \n\nThe note? She wrote 'FUCK OFF' on it, then threw it away out of regret(?). Left it for me (I guess?) to clean, like everything else.\n\n\nThis escalation between the girl and my GF is getting out of hand. We are moving in 6months. I believe that my GF is overreacting and its unnecessary anger, stress, and confusion adding to the situation. \n\nI have stood by my GF for almost 3 years. I have read about PTSD, slowly pushed her towards treatment (finally got her to the Dr for anti-depressants, she hadn\u2019t been to a Dr in many many years). I have tried (slowly) to get her to therapy.. we made a few appointments that she canceled (a while ago). \n\nI feel like my GF isn\u2019t trying. She is being overloaded. She is also being selfish and rude when that is in NO WAY the person I knew years ago. I have been patient with her conditions. I have tried nothing but to help her. I have made stands on some things (almost exclusively cleaning, especially our room that looks like a disaster area, due to her). I\u2019m approaching the end of my rope. Completely ignoring me begging her for years to clean, explaining that it stresses me out the way her triggers do, is starting to really piss me off and make me feel like she doesn't care about my happiness if it means an ounce of work for her. \n\n**TL;DR** My GF is freaking out over my roommate\u2019s recent actions. I believe it is a completely irrational response. I have taken triggers into consideration, but believe she is being selfish and closing off. I have tried to help her as much as possible, but I have my fears that if this is how she acts now, what will our future (on a different coast we\u2019re moving to) hold. That fear has me questioning our future, viability, health, etc.\n\nAny input would help.

No matter how hard I try. Like I know what the vent would be about. I'm hypersexual, and I have issues with my gender and my religion. But the sections where I write out, even in a private journal where no one can see, feel such an immense panic that I just can't get it out onto paper.\n\nI get that this is common, and most people can just suck it up and move on, but because I'm such a loud person, I've established a status quo with people that I will come to them when I'm upset. That's why when these things cross my mind and start throttling me, I want to be able to go to them and talk about it, but I get overwhelmed with such a large amount of panic that I just can't function. I feel like I'm denying them, or that I should tell them.\n\nBut it's not like I can just go on hiding it forever. It's a persistently invasive part of my life that has consistently made me very upset on a number of occasions but what am I supposed to do? Vent? (haha) So it's like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place right now.
