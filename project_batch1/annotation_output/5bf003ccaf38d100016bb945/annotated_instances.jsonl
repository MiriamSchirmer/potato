She suffers from PTSD from her past combat deployment and seeks help pretty regularly. They have her on antidepressants right now and for the most part, I thought they were working. They suppressed her appetite at first and its now changed her intimacy level with me and everything I do either leads to a fight or her needing to be left alone. She says I talk too much, yet she barely opens up to me at all. Only when shes buzzed or drunk will I see some form of intimacy or her need for me. She has some serious underlying issues that I want to help her with so bad, but I know I can\u2019t. I really do love her, I wouldn\u2019t trade her for anything this world has to offer. I just want to know if there are any helpful tips someone could give me in how to go about things and how to be there for her the best I can, even if she cannot verbally communicate it.
