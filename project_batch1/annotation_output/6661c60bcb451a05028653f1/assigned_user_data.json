My mom was mentally ill and beat me and my siblings on a daily basis and my dad beat my mom often in front of us children. My mom yelled at me for everything: If I laughed to much, If I cried, if I was angry so basically when I showed any emotion at all. If I did well in school (A:s were the only acceptable grade) helped her by being her emotional support as soon as I came home from school aka listening to her problems etc she would not beat me. But as soon as I did the slightest wrong she beat me and told me that she wished that she had just done an abortion etc \n\nI remember that my mom used to beat me when I was 4-7 years old just because I was so ugly. She pulled my hair and slammed me into a wall and she beat me and cried at the same time and yelled that I was a disappointment in every way. She forced me to have my hair up in a high ponytail or else she would beat me and pull my hair. I am born with a large forehead but the high ponytails only made it worse (I never wear my hair up now bc is how large of a forehead I have) I was also bullied because of that and because everyone knew that they beat me at home so in school they knew that I was an easy target, I remember just laying in my own piss one time because I was so scared after being beaten in school and scared of going home knowing that my mom would beat me because I pissed my pants. \n\nIn conclusion my childhood sucked and that has caused a lot of problems now that I am a young adult F21, especially in my relationship. Me and my BF M21  has been in a relationship for 2,5 years and he is wonderful. The problem is that I am so insecure, I can worry that he will meet someone better if he goes away to work or just goes to buy some groceries.

My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I\u2019ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they\u2019d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn\u2019t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. \n\nWhen I was 18 (I\u2019m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.\n\nOn my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me.

My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I\u2019ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they\u2019d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn\u2019t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. \n\nWhen I was 18 (I\u2019m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind.
