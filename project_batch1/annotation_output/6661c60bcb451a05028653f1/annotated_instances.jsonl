{"id": "2458_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Relationship problems caused by trauma Hi!\n\nI had a very hard time during my childhood. My mom was mentally ill and beat me and my siblings on a daily basis and my dad beat my mom often in front of us children. My mom yelled at me for everything: If I laughed to much, If I cried, if I was angry so basically when I showed any emotion at all. If I did well in school (A:s were the only acceptable grade) helped her by being her emotional support as soon as I came home from school aka listening to her problems etc she would not beat me. But as soon as I did the slightest wrong she beat me and told me that she wished that she had just done an abortion etc \n\nI remember that my mom used to beat me when I was 4-7 years old just because I was so ugly. She pulled my hair and slammed me into a wall and she beat me and cried at the same time and yelled that I was a disappointment in every way. She forced me to have my hair up in a high ponytail or else she would beat me and pull my hair. I am born with a large forehead but the high ponytails only made it worse (I never wear my hair up now bc is how large of a forehead I have) I was also bullied because of that and because everyone knew that they beat me at home so in school they knew that I was an easy target, I remember just laying in my own piss one time because I was so scared after being beaten in school and scared of going home knowing that my mom would beat me because I pissed my pants. \n\nIn conclusion my childhood sucked and that has caused a lot of problems now that I am a young adult F21, especially in my relationship. Me and my BF M21  has been in a relationship for 2,5 years and he is wonderful. The problem is that I am so insecure, I can worry that he will meet someone better if he goes away to work or just goes to buy some groceries. I am constantly feeling as if I am not enough and that he will leave me for anyone because I see other people as better than me, like I really mean every human I meet. I have a lot of anxiety and have a hard time talking to him about this, I really try to and are not actively refusing to talk but I often just don\u2019t know how to describe it. I also don\u2019t want to control him or let my anxiety make him shitty because it is not his fault, he has never given me any reason to even be worried but still I feel like shit. I feel sad sometimes and jealous when he hangs out with friends but I never tell him that he should not hang out whit them and he hangs out with them despite me having panic attacks and feeling as if I suck and that he will find someone better etc etc etc \n\nI am 100% aware that my feelings are not valid, I am loved but I just can not feel it and believe it. I go to trauma focused therapy (PTSD) so I am working on it and by BF knows about it and we always talk about it. He usually hugs me and tells me that he loves me etc and I just lay in his arms crying like a baby and knowing that my feelings are stupid but just can not make them go away.\n\nSo, Reddit or r/ptsd what do I do and am I the only one who feels like this?\n\nI love my BF so extremely much and I really want to grow old with him and have kids and be together through everything but I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. As if I should leave him before he leave me and that this is an example of how fucked up and unworthy of love I really am. I just don\u2019t want to hurt him and I know that my heart would shatter into pieces without him but if that is what is better for him then I want that. He says that he is happy and we really are happy most of the time but this ruins so much. \n\nAnd also, during one year I had this thing were I bought stuff on credit and it started out as what I thought a one time thing but then I used it as a coping mechanism. During that time I did not really understand that it was bad but when I realized about 6 months ago I knew that I needed to talk to my BF about it but I did not want him to leave me so I held it a secret for three more months and then I finally told him. I have ruined his trust in me now. I have never lied about anything and neither has he that has been like the most important thing in our relationship but now I ruined it.

My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I\u2019ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they\u2019d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn\u2019t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. \n\nWhen I was 18 (I\u2019m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.\n\nOn my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me. We met up and drove around, hung out at his place and divulged in deep conversations for hours on end. \n\nAfter a couple of times he became very flirtatious and made a pass at me. \nI was pretty sexually inexperienced and he knew that, in hindsight I feel as though  he fetishized my innocence (he casually) brought it up countless times. When we first started hooking  up , it was pretty vanilla and ..normal I guess.\n\n\nOvertime he began to become really aggressive and rough , he was kind of coercive and disregarded some of my boundaries. He would choke me so hard to where I would run out of air and the next day my neck would be riddled with bruises (I was okay with choking but not that extreme). I have a visceral memory of how dark and sinister his eyes looked while he would do this. \n\nOn one occasion he did something  I did NOT consent too and it really upset me, I consented you\u2019re sex but not what he did in the midst of it(I don\u2019t feel comfortable being less vague ) it wasn\u2019t I\u2019ve isolated thing, but during that instance I remember spacing out until it was over with..was paralyzed and couldn\u2019t think. He took me home and gave the impression he was oblivious and things were fine ,  I didn\u2019t tell him what I was feeling. I felt stupid because I am partially responsible for putting myself in a compromising position and allowing myself to be taken  advantage of, I also had such little value in myself that I didn\u2019t want him to stop seeing me. After a while he ghosted me, and I was devastated. I was angry and felt used and beat myself up over it for a while. \n\nHe also dated a string of girls around my age, I didn\u2019t find that off until it was over though. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone about this, I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out or to be judged but I feel like this was a tipping point into my descent of substance abuse and depression. \nThere were so many other things that contributed \nTo my depression manifesting and festering over time and this wasn\u2019t the worst thing that happened to me per-say but it was the straw that broke the camels back. \n\nI haven\u2019t had sex in 2 years  I don\u2019t date and I wish that I could go back In time and stop everything from happening. I wish I could scrub it from my mind entirely but I can\u2019t and I still have dreams about the whole ordeal. \n\n\nAny advice on how to open up about this to a therapist, I\u2019ve always felt too embarrassed to.
