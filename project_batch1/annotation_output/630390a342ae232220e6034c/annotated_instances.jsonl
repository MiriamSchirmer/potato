{"id": "1202_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I just don't know what to do, mostly just a vent post, but if you think there's something that can help I'm all ears Honestly theres probably nothing anyone could say that could help (although your more than welcome to try, I will always appreciate support) but I've been on meds to treat my PTSD for about a year now and about 6 months for the medication i'm on now, and its working so well, I've honestly never been this happy in my entire life. However, I'm studying abroad in france for this semester and I'm about to run out of this medication, and I cant get anyone to prescribe me a medication I feel comfortable taking, so I may just have to go off my meds. In france it seems that doctors just automatically want to give you xanex for anything anxiety related, obviously I dont think theres anything wrong with taking Xanex in general, if it helps someone thats great but since I have been taking a non-addictive medication in the states that has worked wonders, and my US doctor has made it clear she doesn't like prescribing Xanex unless nothing else works I'm incredibly uncomfortable with it. I have now been going to doctors appointments for a month now trying to get something I can take (I've taken SSRI's before, and while they still leave me with way too many mental illness symptoms, the worst of them are gone), and of the 5 different doctors appointments I've had all have been really against prescribing me anything other than  Xanex. Im honestly just so scared, the last time I went off medications I failed every assignment I had during that time period, and spent almost every second of my day in bed feeling like crap, and this time, since I'm abroad I don't even have friends that I can reach out to in person, just through text for the second half of the day, thanks to the time difference. I've already noticed my mental health getting significantly worse just from the stressed cause by all this. I'm just so worried, and I know the worry is just going to make everything worse, because even though i'm medicated right now its making me miserable, so I'm going to crash fast and of course I'm going to dun out right in the middle of midterm week. Anyways thanks for reading all this, I just needed to get it out somewhere and I didn't know where else to go.

We found out later that there was no actual threat in the school, but I thought there was. I spent an hour and a half huddled up in my creative writing classroom fearing for my life, having no idea what was going on, having reason to believe someone was in the school with a gun or a knife or something. I was 11 years old and mentally preparing myself to be murdered. I wasn't though. No one was remotely physically hurt in anyway. There wasn't actually a shooting or anything. We just thought there was. I thought there was. No one understands that. They all think \"well nothing actually happened, it couldn't have been that scary\" or \"you can't really have PTSD from that\". No one understands how much being in that situation really hurts. I often say \"silence is scarier than gunshots\". I almost wish I could hear an attacker, then at least I would have some idea of what was going on. People were locked outside during the lockdown, too. We heard loud banging as they tried to get inside. We thought it was the person who would kill us. I thought I was going to die. No one understands that. No one takes this seriously. They think I'm just insane. It makes me feel like I am just insane.

Boy is it hard. \n\nI  had a rough month last month. Got hired on into a new job, Dad was diagnosed with cancer and had surgery. Fianc\u00e9 went through issues that triggered his anxiety and on top of all of that I\u2019m working on healing from my trauma and all the spin offs from it (I\u2019m a assault survivor and the anniversary just happened).  I\u2019m going through some of the darker parts of what happened in therapy and it\u2019s draining on me. \n\nAlso add that my mom leans on me for support and I had to talk her down from anxiety in relation to my dad while trying to deal with my own pain and emotions from it.\n\nRough month right? \n\nI finally hit a wall, I just needed a break.  I had to be strong with all that was going on and it hit me hard.  And yesterday I felt that straw break.  \n\nIn the middle of all the craziness that was happening at work yesterday, my mom calls me...my step grandmother has cancer (bone) and I just couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to hear it at that time.  I had shut down. \n\nI couldn\u2019t provide the logic my mom wanted to hear. She didn\u2019t even listen to me when I asked her to stop. She just kept going on and on about what cancer it was and what may happen next and how everyone is upset.  I actually snapped and yelled stop. I told her I could not process right now and that I need a break. I asked to let me had the night and we can talk about it the next day.  \n\nHer response was to tell me that \u201cI could just find out about it myself\u201d and hung up on me. \n\nI\u2019m angry, hurt and shutting down, please tell me others have felt this way too.

{"id": "610_ptsd", "displayed_text": "24 years later; PTSD diagnosis. Hi. I\u2019ve been reading this sub for a while, suspecting I had ptsd. For years I\u2019ve abused various substances, suffered with anxiety, depression and insomnia. Having recently engaged with an addiction counsellor brought up some of my past. When I was 14 my friend was beaten so badly he died of complications relating to brain trauma a few days later. I was sat next to him. I got dragged through a murder trial. Never once did I cry about it. Turning to drugs, drink, petty theft and violence almost immediately after. My mother I suspect is a covert narcissist and my father an emotional black hole. The whole thing got brushed aside while I started to burn my life. \n\nMy whole life I thought I had absolutely no feelings around this. I genuinely felt nothing. Zero. Until I stumbled across it in counselling. Only now am I coming to realise I do have very strong feelings around this. For 20 odd years I\u2019ve been suppressing this with various substances, never realising the reason for my pain. Only now realising why I feel scared when the phone rings (one of my friends rang me to tell me my friend had died).  \n\nMy doctor diagnosed me with ptsd today. I thought I\u2019d feel relieved but I just feel incredibly sad that I\u2019ve been carrying this around with me for so long, buried so deep, manifesting in depression, insomnia and substance abuse amongst other things.
