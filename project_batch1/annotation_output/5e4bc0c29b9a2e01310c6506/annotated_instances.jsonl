Moderators, if this post is at all hurtful it is completely unintentional and I would want you to take it down. I have never started a conversation here before and in no way want to hurt or offend. Here goes... I am diagnosed with PTSD from a violent rape 15 years ago. After many miserable years of escalating symptoms I have been in therapy for 3.5 years. My flashbacks and visceral feelings have been under control for a couple of years until today. I don\u2019t know what it is about the verdict but I feel incredibly out of body at the moment. I feel weak and have had multiple crying jags since getting home from work. I\u2019m a teacher so it was brave face and bury it all day until I could get home. Without getting to much into it, I feel so let down and ANGRY. It feels like how my life used to be on the daily and I just have to get through this evening.

{"id": "2430_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Having a hard time opening up to loved ones TW for all of this (rape, assault)\n\nI\u2019m 20 years old, female. When I was freshly 16, I was raped during a party in a small apartment, with the door open, and nobody helped me. I began acting out and getting in a lot of trouble after this, ultimately landing myself in acute inpatient for suicidal thoughts. I wrote my parents a letter telling them what happened to me, and social workers had to come in the hospital and report it with me. They never, ever contacted me or my parents EVER again. That alone is its own damage. \n2 years later, freshly 18 now, I began working as a houseman in a hotel. This means I cleaned everything except for inside the actual rooms. Well, there was a man that would stay Monday-Thursday for his construction job. He took an interest in me quickly, asking my age, where I go to school, then progressing into telling me I have \u201cbeautiful bedroom eyes\u201d and \u201cpure ness in my smile\u201d I knew he was up to something. He then began asking me which car is mine, when do I get off work, will my parents be waiting on me to come home from work tonight, etc. I began to be paranoid even when I left work, getting trapped in moments of my 16 year old self, thinking nobody cares what would happen to me, because after all, the police don\u2019t care about me.  At one point he entered the lady\u2019s restroom where I was cleaning, had me in a corner, touched my arm and asked how I like the new job. :( \nOne day, and this is so hard for me to tell because it became a repressed memory until my second hospitalization in October 2019, I was vacuuming the second floor hallway. Humming to myself probably, at the very start of this floor, the door to my left opened quickly. An arm, with orange hair and freckles, oh my god this is it, an arm grabs me. It was the man. He held me just inside the room, my left foot in the doorway. He told me to look in his eyes, gripped my arm tighter, and held me there. I was thinking to myself that this is it, he has me. He could\u2019ve done whatever he wanted. It felt like my eyes were looking into his for years, and his eyes, they were like... glass. Empty, yet fiery.  My mind made me see myself, naked, beaten, raped, and left all alone in the woods to rot. He let me go and I finished my shift. I was in a state of denial, showing up to my following shift in the morning. When I got to the second floor again, I actually passed out, and I\u2019ve never passed out! I completely fell to the ground, it felt like I swallowed a rock. \nLong story, but my entire 2018 consisted of horrible paranoid thoughts and migraines, but I had forgotten this incident for a long time, so my therapist and I had a hard time getting it under control. Now that I remember, my life is bad. I have also borderline personality disorder that causes me MUCH distress on a daily basis, but now I\u2019m miserable. I have flashbacks during the day time, I can\u2019t even take the trash out alone. I\u2019ve lost all my friends. My relationships are shallow and meaningless, except for my boyfriend. I never feel safe. I have gotten to the point of accusing my father of trying to rape me (absolutely delusional, he\u2019s never touched me) and had similar accusations to my friends and even my boyfriend at some points. Sometimes, when the flashbacks are bad and I can\u2019t afford to buy my medical marijuana, I get stuck in loops of seeing my dead and raped body again. It\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m scared to tell my family what happened because it seems like... nothing happened. Nothing happened but I spend everyday asking myself if this existence is even fucking worth it.\n\nTLDR; I already told my family about a trauma, and now I feel this new trauma is not enough to trouble them over.

I need some advice about something I exeprienced in which I cant really find anything similar to my personal account of seeing someone overdose elswhere online to try and get some answers, other perspectives...\nalthough im still on the younger side, i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse just everything in which i am grateful for because it has made me very tough and able to relate with others.. i was dead sure i could handle anything but this . this has turned my world upside downn. it happened last july and i am much better mentally now but i still struggle with ptsd and triggers... i met this kid wonderful heart but misguided (not an addict)  and still has that feeling of invincibility..anyways we were in my room and the first incident we were on my bed and he was holding himself up on top of me kissing me and then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless . ill admit my first reaction was wrong, i was scared, and didnt realize his breathing and heart were stopping i was just shaking him yelling his name.. luckily he popped up and was like what happened wherr am i.. but quickly fell back into his high .. i knew from there something wasnt right so i was on high alert  (he had apparently taken stuff before he got to my house that i was guessing but wasnt sure).. after that he  snorted one in front of me i begged him to stop but he wouldnt and i couldnt force him to stop in that mindset he had . he then went in to use my bathroom (separate toilet room from shower area) and i was like okay ill just keep calling his name to make sure hes okay.. ( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right\u00bf but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone \"stops breathing\" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn ..", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 312, "end": 316, "span": "rape", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 337, "end": 342, "span": "abuse", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 893, "end": 1033, "span": "he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2401, "end": 2447, "span": "pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2451, "end": 2548, "span": "dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 38s "}}
