CONTENT/TRIGGER WARNING: Detailed story of child abuse, near-death experiences, guns, animal death\n\nI have PTSD from childhood abuse from my step-father (who I was raised to believe was my biological father) and from my mother who neglected me a lot throughout my life until I moved out.\n\nI haven't lived with my mom and step-dad since 2011 and I still have vivid nightmares and flashbacks from my childhood.\n\nOne thing that I'd like to share with you all is a certain situation my step-dad put my family in. It was 2012, I was living with my grandparents, but went to Chuck E. Cheese with my mom, step-dad, and brother because my mom wanted me to go with them.\nEverything was going okay until we left and got inside my step-dad's truck.\n\nMy step-dad has a permit to open carry a pistol, which I still have no idea how he was able to even get that gun, but then again, 'murrica. He caries that damn thing with him everywhere.\n\nAnyways, we were all sitting in the truck, step-dad in driver's seat, mom in passenger seat, and my brother and me in the backseat. Out of the blue, my step-dad locks the doors of the vehicle and takes out his pistol. As soon as I saw him do this, I just thought to myself, \"great, we're all going to die now.\" He pointed the barrel at our heads, smiling and waving his gun around like it was a toy. He almost never keeps the safety on.\n\n\"I could kill all of you right now, just put a bullet in all of your heads,\" he said, laughing, still waving the gun around.\n\n\"(S-D's name), please stop, you're scaring us!\" My mom cried.\n\nHe pointed the gun at her and told her, \"shut the fuck up!\"\n\nThen my mom said, \"this is why OP doesn't want to be around us anymore!\"\n\nMy step-dad groaned and put away his pistol, claiming that my mom always has to \"ruin the fun\" and then drove me back to my grandparents' house.\n\nAbout a year after he had gotten the gun (back in 2009), I was sitting in the living room watching War of the Worlds. Suddenly, he just pulled his pistol out in the living room, stood up, pointed the gun at me, and pulled the trigger. I screamed so loud and tried to cover myself up. I remember the feeling of the adrenaline rushing through my veins and feeling so helpless. Then, I heard him laugh at me and said, \"OP, stop being fucking ridiculous, the magazine's not even in!\"\n\nWell, he ended up accidentally killing his dog back in 2012. He took his sleeping pills before cleaning out his gun. The magazine was out, but there was a bullet stuck in the chamber. He accidentally pulled the trigger. It went straight through his arm chair and hit his dog in the head. She yelped slightly and tried to walk away before she slumped down and passed on. Luckily, I didn't have to witness that situation first hand (my mother had told me when I asked where the dog was when I was visiting her once).\n\nThat's not the only abusive thing that he's done, but it's been replaying in my mind ever since the school shooting in Florida.\n\nThe only ones I've told these stories to are my boyfriend, a couple trusted friends, and two therapists.\n\nIt terrifies me whenever people ask me how I feel about gun control. I feel like they will think I'm being ridiculous when I tell them I support stricter gun regulations, but honestly, if an abusive man with mental illness can LEGALLY get a firearm and threaten to shoot his family, pretend to shoot his own kid, and accidentally kill his dog with it, there should obviously be some sort of stricter regulations.\n\nI haven't reported him. I've always been afraid to. My mom would always tell me as a child to not tell ANYONE that he abused me because she didn't want her kids taken away from her. That's still engraved in my brain, even to this day. Even the thought of reporting him gives me waves of anxiety.\n\nHe still has that gun and he still is legally allowed to open-carry.

(possibly triggering for sexual abuse, rape, trauma) Hi everyone,\n\nI'm pretty new to this sub and would like some insight into what others feel when they are experiencing flashbacks.\n\nBACKGROUND INFO (skip if you want)\n\nTo give some background information on my experience, I was sexually abused/raped(?) by my step dad 4 years ago (and sexually abused by him multiple times over many years before) but I didn't get any medical help for that although I did tell my mum and boyfriend about it after the \"big happening\". I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. \n\n**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. \n\nFor me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. \n\nWhy do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   \n\nTL;DR\n\nmy flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny feedback would be great.

I had shoved my childhood abuse in a closet to never look at it again.\n\nBut after months of sleep deprivation, fixating on having to be the perfect mom and excessive paranoid thoughts of my beautiful child dying or being kidnapped I was coming undone at the seems.\n\nMy husband pushes me to go to therapy and I learned that my erratic moods, my paranoia, my insomnia... just every little thing that made my life hard was real. It wasn't just me defective, born wrong. I knew I could do something to improve my life and my daughters.\n\nHowever anger is a huge problem for me and one time when my daughter was about 1.5 years old, she was being a kid. An I just lost it, I screamed at her at the top of my lungs and slammed the kitchen cupboard so hard it broke off its hinges. The second I turned around and saw my daughters scared face I broke down.\n\nI asked myself how I could do this? What kind of mother scares her child? I held her close and I promised myself I would die before I ever let my anger scare my child again. But its not so easy, the anger comes faster than I even have time to process whats happening and it bursts out of me. When I was young I used breaking this as a way to vent it, but I can't any longer go around destroying crap, especially not in front of a 2 year old.\n\nMy solution now? Lay down on the floor. Literally as fast as I can, lay down flat on the floor, face down and take a few deep breaths. Tell myself \"you're mental illness isnt who you are\" over and over again. When my daughter stops throwing a fit, or doing whatever it is that has dried up my patience levels and sees me, I pop up and go \"peek a boo\". She then laughs and goes \"again!\"\n\nThe point is... My biggest fear is my mental health causing my child to be scarred, to have a broken childhood. It feels so good to take a moment I am not emotionally in control and turn it into something she sees as so innocent. She's too young to know that mom isn't perfect.

{"id": "2403_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Requesting advice for anxiety around men... Hello humans, \n\nBelow is a non-graphic summary of my current predicament and I was hoping to gain some advice!\n\nI work in the live production world in general - concert/theatrical touring shows specifically - and I am 26 years old. This interest of mine began in high school when I had the opportunity to participate in our school's theater program for which I built sets, hung lights, and operated audio. This was also my first co-ed experience as from age 4 to 18 I went to an all girls school. To put on theater productions, however, we would work with the all boys school across the street. While I did well in theater back then, I was often ignored by the other students and teachers as they all came from the boys school and weren't sure how to interact with me... I think. Even when I became a vital participant in making productions happen, I kept to myself because I was also put off by the social dynamic of the boys.\n\nI pursued this in New York City where I went to college during which time being the only woman on a production crew was also the norm. In 2013 and 2015 respectively I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body. The earlier was while working at a music festival, the later was during an off campus Black Student Union event. At those times I was eager to put those experiences behind me and forget about it however still fell into a sort of social anxiety/paranoia from 2015-2017 at which point I left New York City taking the freelancing rhythm of my life on the road. I was based out of Maryland that summer yet traveled to festivals all over the country for the job I had. Then I spent the next several months out in Virginia where I attended a great church with a female pastor and a congregation that consisted of about twenty women and two men. The community there was a big catalyst for me pulling myself back together.\n\nAfter that I applied for and accepted my first permanent job in a management position at a concert venue in Washington DC but in the eight months I was there received progressively unnerving approaches from one of the male staff members. That compounded with my desire to get back on the road touring prompted me to quit. On top of all that, working with the same large group of men day to day made me more paranoid than working with men in passing on my typical 1-3 month gigs. However I assumed that it might've just been a symptom of the overall environment of that workplace.\n\nCurrently I am on my longest tour yet: an 11 month contract that began in July 2019. By this point I noticed the overwhelming pattern that I am only able to feel relaxed around women. I'm responsible for all the logistics of the tour unit. I'm the one who dictates who rides in each car and who is where on each bus. For all of these I've made it so I'm only with women whether that be in a car or in a certain area of the bus. However my fellow managers are men and recently I was forced to change the car assignments due to a change in our overall production schedule. Because of this I share an office with them in each arena or theater we go to. The crew, as per usual, is also mostly men. While things were mostly fine from July-November, since December I've been developing a growing sense of anxiety around my coworkers for seemingly no good reason. This culminated two weeks ago with me having a panic attack from sitting between two of them on a four hour plane ride during which they were asleep most of the time which resulted in lots of accidental physical contact and being breathed on.\n\nI've been averse to physical contact my whole life but since college it evolved into more of an acute fear. Because of this I modified my wardrobe so that everything but my face and hands was covered at all times creating a bit of a buffer or even a deterrent.\n\nMy main frustration now is that these men are not doing anything. They are of no threat to me. Yet my body is reacting as if they were constantly. Due to the nature of my job I'm practically living with these people. Because of all this I'm searching for methods or strategies to make these feelings stop.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1144, "end": 1220, "span": "I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body.", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 56s "}}

I\u2019ve been in therapy but so far there hasn\u2019t been a ton of improvement.\n(I apologize if this wasn\u2019t the place for this post I didn\u2019t know where else it would go)", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 413, "end": 508, "span": "two years ago I was struck in a crosswalk by a car and sustained a pretty serious head injury.

{"id": "1613_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD from traumatic relationship vent/input So... this is my first time posting here... Not sure where I\u2019m going with this. I\u2019ve had my fair share of rough relationships, sure, who hasn\u2019t? But the last few years has been beyond bad. Like ending a 10 year relationship, losing a job I loved bc of my mental health, trying to move on with someone else and dealing with mental torture that led to a suicide attempt bad. I feel so stupid and pathetic even typing this. I mean people have been through so much worse. Yeah I was sexually abused as a child but that was forever ago and I was never physically abused in my relationships. But on top of depression, anxiety, and avoidant personality disorder, I\u2019ve also just been diagnosed with PTSD stemming from the last couple years. Maybe this is considered complex-PTSD and should be posted there instead? Sorry. \n\nIt felt dumb to me hearing that. I know it\u2019s possible. I guess I\u2019m just in denial. But then I think about it. We didn\u2019t even have a long relationship. 9 months. That\u2019s nothing. But the last 3 months he inflicted more damage than I\u2019d known in 10 years. I haven\u2019t seen or spoken to him since my suicide attempt in September 2018. I\u2019ve sought help. I\u2019m on meds again and in therapy. I\u2019m better than I used to be. Then today I got a message from his gf. There\u2019s a whole backstory to her but it\u2019s honestly just too complicated to explain right now. As soon as I saw her name everything came back. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I was lightheaded and dizzy. My chest was tight. I started sweating and felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe. Like I was about to pass out. (Panic attack, I know) I could see him again perfectly. In my face screaming. I could hear him. Feel his skin. Smell him. Everything. I was watching a movie with my kids (they\u2019re 13 and 11) so I calmly got up and went outside and just completely broke down.\n\nI mean come on, it\u2019s been a year and half.

{"id": "2496_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I've been diagnosed with PTSD but it doesn't feel right (Mention of violence) This is going to be a long post. Sorry!\n\nI've always had anxiety but a little over a year ago I got the courage to solo-travel New Zealand long term. I gained a ton of confidence while doing this, and overcame a lot of my social anxiety. Eventually I got a job in Christchurch, it wasn't all perfect, I had my ups and downs but I was doing pretty well - going for walks frequently, exploring the city, living a 'normal life'.\n\nThen the shooting happened. To be clear, I didn't see/hear/experience anything. My life was never in actual danger, I was just living in the city at the time. At first it was disbelief, then fear (not knowing if they caught everyone) then crippling sadness. I had such a strong desire to run away and just go home but I couldn't right away. One of my coworkers was shot and spent months in ICU. I left Christchurch a little over a week after the attack. It felt wrong, but I had been offered a job back home and had already put my notice in at work.  \n\nAt first when I got back home and started my new job I was mostly fine. I was living with my parents until I could get an apartment in the city closer to work. I moved into my apartment in May and started having issues pretty quickly. Waking up multiple times a night, disoriented and sweaty. Random attacks of sadness and excessive anger over small problems. Being afraid of random people on the street. Wanting/needing to go do something (go to the store for example) and having a mental block. Anxiety over inconsequential things.\n\nI started going to therapy in June and he diagnosed me with PTSD. He gave me an ESA letter to get a dog which has helped immensely. But the therapy wasn't helping, my brain would kind of just shut off and I wouldn't have anything to say and I wouldn't remember anything he would say. It was really just giving me more anxiety so I stopped going.\n\nThe diagnosis just doesn't feel right to me. Maybe because I know I was never in any actual danger. I get intrusive memories of the sadness and aftermath though.  Recently I've been even more hyper-vigilant than usual. I listen to audiobooks at work so my mind doesn't wander but it makes me anxious because I don't always know when someone approaches me, and I jump when they do. I get anxious walking outside when its too quiet, dark, rainy (hood up, peripheral vision blocked) or too crowded, and I cant walk with headphones in. I feel like I am constantly stressed and anxious even though I have no real reason to be. I scratch at arms and hands and have a hard time making myself stop.\n\nI've always had problems with anxiety and mood swings so I'm having a hard time distinguishing from old symptoms and new. Part of myself keeps thinking that this isn't PTSD, this is just my anxiety coming back.\n\nI don't even know what I am looking for from posting this, other than maybe if other people have gone through the same thoughts.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 672, "end": 766, "span": "irst it was disbelief, then fear (not knowing if they caught everyone) then crippling sadness.", "annotation": "uncertain"}, {"start": 850, "end": 902, "span": "One of my coworkers was shot and spent months in ICU", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 35s "}}
