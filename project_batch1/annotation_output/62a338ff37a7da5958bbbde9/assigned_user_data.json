Suddenly, he just pulled his pistol out in the living room, stood up, pointed the gun at me, and pulled the trigger. I screamed so loud and tried to cover myself up.

But you know how it is, some people told me the worst you can imagine. Told me what happened to them. How they suffer. How they hallucinate. Basically told me their life is an ongoing terror. All I was answering was like: oh I'm so sorry. I didn't have it so bad.\n\n(Before I went to this clinic I was in a general hospital, there they told me to NEVER talk about my trauma until I'm in the PTSD clinic.)\n\nWhen I finally had my trauma therapy session. I told her everything but I didn't feel it. It was like I don't care. I apologized and said I am wrong here.\n\nI still am sure I do not have PTSD. A new therapist even told me laughing in my face I don't have it. I don't have vivid flashbacks. All I have is this mental void I get suck in. In this dark hole, where I can't get out. And nightmares.\n\n\nIt really gave me a form of relief when I first heard my diagnosis, like I know what I have to deal with now. But now I'm... just existing. I don't have something to fight, just myself.\n\nI am really open about not having PTSD, I don't get mad if you tell me you don't think I have this, actually I feel like an imposter and I am angry at myself that I post here and take the support away from real PTSD survivors."}, "1495_incel": {"id": "1495_incel", "text": " Over.

I could write a litany of things I adore about him but I won\u2019t subject the reddit community ;) Anyway he\u2019s been through some shit and I think only recently (a few yrs from retirement) has started to realize he may have some trauma related issues. We don\u2019t know if he has full blown ptsd or just some of the symptoms, but in my mind the label doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is that he (and I) are living things that I feel convinced are tied to the trauma he experienced. He\u2019s hesitant to get help or be diagnosed (not unwilling, just hesitant) because he\u2019s worried he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep working and he loves what he does, and of course the whole army mental health stigma thing. You know the drill. \n\nAnd I get it.\n\nBut we\u2019re already trying to navigate a long distance relationship, and when he\u2019s not doing well he goes through periods where he shuts down and shuts me (and everyone) out suddenly and for indefinite periods of time.\n\nThat\u2019s happening right now. And the thing is, I know I\u2019m just going to have to wait for him to resurface, there\u2019s really no other choice. I have almost only compassion and love for him, and while I feel upset and hurt on a personal level, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s about me \u2014 in fact I know it\u2019s not. I just want to be able to be there to support and love on him, and I don\u2019t want him to feel like a burden or a failure (got this from him, not my assumption). He\u2019s been infinitely patient and compassionate with my anxiety issues that would have thrown any guy for a loop, so I want to be able to do the same for him. It hurts when I can\u2019t.\n\nBut I just don\u2019t know how to handle these situations. Of course my anxiety and emotions go haywire when I just get shut out and don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll next hear from him.\n\nSo I guess I need insight.

This past week (second week) I\u2019ve periodically reached out or tried to call, still to no effect. I\u2019ve tried to stay gentle in my messages and say that I love him and am here etc but just need to hear something from him. But he\u2019s not even opening messages and I have a hunch he\u2019s leaving his phone off now.\n\nMy best guess is that he\u2019s getting messages from a lot of family and loved ones and can\u2019t bear to answer or have to constantly ignore notifications. Which would mean he\u2019s really not in a good place. He\u2019s such a gentle and loving soul so I know it gives him pain to shut people he loves out, which tells me his overwhelm and/or depression is even more painful.\n\nSo I have only been able to respond to what I feel in determining how and whether to reach out. Not his needs since I don\u2019t know what they are. And so I don\u2019t know, does being persistent help or make it worse, or does it have no effect at all? I don\u2019t mean eight messages or calls a day. I never sent more than about two a day and now it\u2019s only every few days. I don\u2019t want to leave him isolated but I don\u2019t want to pile on more guilt that will push him deeper into a shutdown. And I\u2019m losing my mind not hearing from him. I miss him badly so it\u2019s pretty hard not to make efforts at contact in hopes of finally getting through. Last time this happened I just let him do his thing and waited for him to reach out, and it was almost a month before I heard from him. I don\u2019t think I can bear to do that again.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do.\n\nAnd yes, therapy is on the table and will be a discussion, but I just need insight on how best to deal right now.

I could write a litany of things I adore about him but I won\u2019t subject the reddit community ;) Anyway he\u2019s been through some shit and I think only recently (a few yrs from retirement) has started to realize he may have some trauma related issues. We don\u2019t know if he has full blown ptsd or just some of the symptoms, but in my mind the label doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is that he (and I) are living things that I feel convinced are tied to the trauma he experienced. He\u2019s hesitant to get help or be diagnosed (not unwilling, just hesitant) because he\u2019s worried he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep working and he loves what he does, and of course the whole army mental health stigma thing. You know the drill. \n\nAnd I get it.\n\nBut we\u2019re already trying to navigate a long distance relationship, and when he\u2019s not doing well he goes through periods where he shuts down and shuts me (and everyone) out suddenly and for indefinite periods of time.\n\nThat\u2019s happening right now. And the thing is, I know I\u2019m just going to have to wait for him to resurface, there\u2019s really no other choice. I have almost only compassion and love for him, and while I feel upset and hurt on a personal level, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s about me \u2014 in fact I know it\u2019s not. I just want to be able to be there to support and love on him, and I don\u2019t want him to feel like a burden or a failure (got this from him, not my assumption). He\u2019s been infinitely patient and compassionate with my anxiety issues that would have thrown any guy for a loop, so I want to be able to do the same for him. It hurts when I can\u2019t.\n\nBut I just don\u2019t know how to handle these situations. Of course my anxiety and emotions go haywire when I just get shut out and don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll next hear from him.\n\nSo I guess I need insight.

Not sure if this sub is the right place. Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or \"go see a therapist\" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.\n\nOkay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating/introspecting/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.\n\nEither way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.\n\nIn particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.\n\nThere is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers", "displayed_text": "Some thoughts on dissociation?

Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or \"go see a therapist\" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.\n\nOkay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating/introspecting/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.\n\nEither way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.\n\nIn particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.\n\nThere is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers"}, "2131_counseling": {"id": "2131_counseling", "text": "Your family's opinion is quite demoralizing.Unless you are lying to yourself or to them, then your best effort deserves appreciation and support from family.The family members may have reasons besides the actual outcome of your school work to be so blind to your investment of effort.Maybe they target onto you their unhappiness in some other area of their lives. \u00a0It is often easier to create false narratives if a person wants to avoid looking at themselves.Possibly too, the family people may have a twisted logic to their words, as though ignoring your effort is a way to force you to do more.If you feel the family people will listen to the way their words affect you, then definitely tell them.If not, then you are learning an early lesson on how not everyone is necessarily supportive of others, and how disappointing this feels.", "displayed_text": "Your family's opinion is quite demoralizing.Unless you are lying to yourself or to them, then your best effort deserves appreciation and support from family.The family members may have reasons besides the actual outcome of your school work to be so blind to your investment of effort.Maybe they target onto you their unhappiness in some other area of their lives. \u00a0It is often easier to create false narratives if a person wants to avoid looking at themselves.Possibly too, the family people may have a twisted logic to their words, as though ignoring your effort is a way to force you to do more.If you feel the family people will listen to the way their words affect you, then definitely tell them.If not, then you are learning an early lesson on how not everyone is necessarily supportive of others, and how disappointing this feels."}, "2217_counseling": {"id": "2217_counseling", "text": "I would like to offer my compassion that you are struggling with with these feelings.
