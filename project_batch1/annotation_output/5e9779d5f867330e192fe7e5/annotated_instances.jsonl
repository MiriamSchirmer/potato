I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself.  Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.I notice that you said he left you.  This tells me that you didn\u2019t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you.  Low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can\u2019t do any better.  Also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get.  The way I see it, he did you a favor.   You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be.\u00a0Take this time alone to work on you.  As hurtful as it may be that other people don\u2019t want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you.  Your statement \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I exist anymore\u201d tells me that in addition to low self-esteem, you also don\u2019t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are.  People can and will let you down.  It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and to gain a stronger sense of self.\u00a0Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it.  Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good.  Find a hobby that you enjoy.  Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily.  Google \u201cpositive affirmations\u201d to find some that resonate with you.  Such statements might be \u201cI am a good person who deserves to be happy\u201d or \u201cI can do this.\u201d  Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well.  There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search.Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing.

Things have been going well for the most part, with the exception of a small misunderstanding that resulted in him going silent for about 2 weeks. We spoke and moved past that but last night marked our newest miscommunication.\n\nEarly in the relationship, A expressed to me that sometimes he has a hard time with seeing blood. That it makes him uncomfortable but he\u2019s good for the most part. We planned to spend this weekend together, sort of a little stay-cation. Yesterday, we arrived at our accommodations, ate a nice meal and I changed into something sexy for him. Things were going great. We had been very excited, this would have been our first time\nwaking up together. Eventually, we were intimate with each other (not the first time). During sex, I started to bleed a bit. A mild-moderate amount, but enough for him to notice. He immediately went to the bathroom and spent about 5 minutes cleaning himself off. He was very uncomfortable with it. Once we sat back down, he didn\u2019t even touch me. He\u2019s very well endowed, over 8 easily so I suspect that has something to do with it. We discussed this, and that that is most likely what caused the bleeding. He was unable to move on from it. He explained to me that he was having severe anxiety over it, and that he wasn\u2019t trying to be a jerk but that the smell/sight of blood is hard for him as he\u2019s seen so much of it in his life. He shared briefly that he\u2019s smelled blood burning, and seen wounds. I was open and listening at assured him that I want to be there for him and whatever he needs I want to try to do. Eventually, he said he needed to leave to go get his medicine(I\u2019m assuming for anxiety). He kissed me, hugged me and damn near ran out of the hotel room.\n\nI\u2019m struggling with a few feelings at the moment. I feel resentful that he left me, on a weekend we planned together, alone in a hotel room at 10pm and didn\u2019t care enough to text me and check on me last night or make sure I was safe this morning.
