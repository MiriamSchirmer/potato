We all take things differently but never idolize the trauma, idolize yourself  because when you idolize the trauma the negative cycle of thoughts begins. \n\nPs- I hope I didn\u2019t offend anyone or hurt anyone, i just wanted to tell my mindset and how I felt with ptsd and how I still live with it."}, "1755_ptsd": {"id": "1755_ptsd", "text": "Therapy?

There exists only four years of my 30 year life not touched by trauma. \n\nA list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.\n\nExtreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.\n\n\nFainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I\u2019m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children\u2019s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)\n\n\nInsomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn\u2019t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. \n\n\nVivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it\u2019s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. \n\n\nSocial Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn\u2019t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)\n\n\nDepression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I\u2019m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn\u2019t make me sad or upset, it\u2019s not like I wanted those things because I don\u2019t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn\u2019t close to my dad but wasn\u2019t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn\u2019t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn\u2019t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)\n\n\nIrregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I\u2019m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)\n\n\nConcentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) \n\n\nA few other things I experienced but I don\u2019t feel like going into:\nEating disorders\nAlcohol and drug abuse \nPromiscuity \n\n\nAll of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I\u2019m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. \n\n\nJust now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns.", "displayed_text": "Everything but PTSD Up until my diagnosis this year, I had no idea why I was the way I was.

My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn\u2019t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)\n\n\nDepression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I\u2019m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn\u2019t make me sad or upset, it\u2019s not like I wanted those things because I don\u2019t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn\u2019t close to my dad but wasn\u2019t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn\u2019t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn\u2019t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)\n\n\nIrregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I\u2019m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)\n\n\nConcentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) \n\n\nA few other things I experienced but I don\u2019t feel like going into:\nEating disorders\nAlcohol and drug abuse \nPromiscuity \n\n\nAll of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I\u2019m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. \n\n\nJust now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns."}, "1975_ptsd": {"id": "1975_ptsd", "text": "Seasons of Nightmares (TW: mention of past abuse w/no details) \nSo I know a lot of us have nightmares.

Always strict with my grades (understandable), but he also had a control problem. He always had to control everything relating to my family, even controlled my mother to the point where she wasn\u2019t allowed to spend any money from her own paycheck or wear any makeup to work. He was also emotionally &amp; mentally abusive to her, and emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive to my brother &amp; I on a daily basis (again, I always got it more than him). \n\nWhen I was a sophomore in high school, I was 5\u20195\u201d and a healthy 135-140 lbs. I was a small in tops and about a 6 in jeans, so I was never really considered fat or even overweight, just healthy. During this year, my dad became weirdly obsessed with my weight. He would force me to run and do at home exercises daily, he would also weigh me about once a week. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I feel like if I were the slightest bit overweight/unhealthy then maybe he could of approached differently, like suggesting to eat better or maybe join him in some of his workouts. But no, I wasn\u2019t overweight and he FORCED me to workout. By my senior year of high school his obsession grew even grater. He was weighing me every morning and making me do more intense workouts to lose weight. I ended up weighing 117 lbs by the middle of my senior year. I was so skinny that I looked unhealthy, my collarbones would pop out. I wouldn\u2019t eat much around friends because I was afraid that if I did eat like a normal person, I\u2019d gain weight so I just told my friends excuses like I wasn\u2019t hungry or I had already eaten earlier. They would always tell me that I was too skinny and if everything was okay with me. I would end up telling my parents and my dad would respond with \u201cthey say that because they are jealous.\u201d \n\nIf I didn\u2019t weigh 117 lbs every morning- for example, if I weighted the SLIGHTEST bit over 117, like 117.4 lbs then he\u2019d take my phone away for the day, it would also cause him to get mad at me for gaining an extra 0.4 lbs which would usually end up in a verbal fight and then him hitting me (at 18 years old- and even though I was technically 18 he still controlled everything in my life... my phone, the money that I made at my part time jobs, my car).  I would only get my phone/car/friend privileges back if I weighed 117 lbs the next day. Weeks would go by and I would be stuck at 118-119 lbs, and even though I was doing all the workouts he made me do and barely eating, my weight would fluctuate, especially during my time of the month. So I would go weeks without my phone even though I was driving from school to work/cheerleading practice, so if something were to happen while I was driving I had no way of calling for help. \n\nI remember not having a phone to take pictures with my friends on graduation day because I weighed the slightest bit over 117. This obsession continued into my freshman year of college when he forced me to live at home and commute to still have every bit of control over me. So, it was another year of weighing me every morning, physical &amp; emotional abuse if I didn\u2019t weigh what he wanted me to. I remember one day weighing 120 lbs and he looked at me like he was disgusted by the 3 pounds I had gained and called me fat, and would point out and say that my legs were already bigger from the day before even though I physically still looked the same, but my weight would change because, like I said, it is normal for your weight to fluctuate a couple of pounds. This minor change in weight could be cause by lots of things like retaining water. This continued up until the July before I started my sophomore year of college. \n\nThat July, he was mandated to leave my house because him and my mom were fighting and he hit her in the face and she told me to call the police, so I did. When he was getting escorted out by the police, I remember him turning to me and saying \u201cyou\u2019re the devil. I hate you.\u201d But what else was I going to do? He literally HIT my mom in the face, let alone the lifetime of physical abuse he caused to my brother and I. Fast forward 4 years.... I live with my mom, and my dad and I have a rocky relationship. I love him because he\u2019s my dad. I know he\u2019s always wanted the best for me but due to his narcissistic and controlling ways, he\u2019s had an awful way of showing it. I suffer from diagnosed anxiety, depression and PTSD from my childhood up until my early adult years. He still hasn\u2019t apologized for anything that he\u2019s done, nor realizes that he\u2019s the main reason I have those disorders. I\u2019ve tried to tell him repeatedly that what he did and what he continues to do is not right (no physical abuse anymore, just emotional and mental), including making me feel guilty for things or bad about myself. He also blames everyone else for getting arrested the day he hit my mother. I don\u2019t know what else to do to help him change or to at least recognize what he\u2019s been doing has truly damaged me. Every time I notice that he\u2019s trying to be a better person and try to mend the relationship with me, a fight happens and the unhealthy cycle starts again.", "displayed_text": "My toxic relationship with my dad is still affecting me As a young girl, my father was always hard on me... a little more than my brother. Always strict with my grades (understandable), but he also had a control problem. He always had to control everything relating to my family, even controlled my mother to the point where she wasn\u2019t allowed to spend any money from her own paycheck or wear any makeup to work. He was also emotionally &amp; mentally abusive to her, and emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive to my brother &amp; I on a daily basis (again, I always got it more than him). \n\nWhen I was a sophomore in high school, I was 5\u20195\u201d and a healthy 135-140 lbs. I was a small in tops and about a 6 in jeans, so I was never really considered fat or even overweight, just healthy. During this year, my dad became weirdly obsessed with my weight. He would force me to run and do at home exercises daily, he would also weigh me about once a week. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I feel like if I were the slightest bit overweight/unhealthy then maybe he could of approached differently, like suggesting to eat better or maybe join him in some of his workouts. But no, I wasn\u2019t overweight and he FORCED me to workout. By my senior year of high school his obsession grew even grater. He was weighing me every morning and making me do more intense workouts to lose weight. I ended up weighing 117 lbs by the middle of my senior year. I was so skinny that I looked unhealthy, my collarbones would pop out. I wouldn\u2019t eat much around friends because I was afraid that if I did eat like a normal person, I\u2019d gain weight so I just told my friends excuses like I wasn\u2019t hungry or I had already eaten earlier. They would always tell me that I was too skinny and if everything was okay with me. I would end up telling my parents and my dad would respond with \u201cthey say that because they are jealous.\u201d \n\nIf I didn\u2019t weigh 117 lbs every morning- for example, if I weighted the SLIGHTEST bit over 117, like 117.4 lbs then he\u2019d take my phone away for the day, it would also cause him to get mad at me for gaining an extra 0.4 lbs which would usually end up in a verbal fight and then him hitting me (at 18 years old- and even though I was technically 18 he still controlled everything in my life... my phone, the money that I made at my part time jobs, my car).  I would only get my phone/car/friend privileges back if I weighed 117 lbs the next day. Weeks would go by and I would be stuck at 118-119 lbs, and even though I was doing all the workouts he made me do and barely eating, my weight would fluctuate, especially during my time of the month. So I would go weeks without my phone even though I was driving from school to work/cheerleading practice, so if something were to happen while I was driving I had no way of calling for help. \n\nI remember not having a phone to take pictures with my friends on graduation day because I weighed the slightest bit over 117. This obsession continued into my freshman year of college when he forced me to live at home and commute to still have every bit of control over me. So, it was another year of weighing me every morning, physical &amp; emotional abuse if I didn\u2019t weigh what he wanted me to.
