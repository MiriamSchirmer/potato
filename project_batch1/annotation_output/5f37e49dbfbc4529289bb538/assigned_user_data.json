I always wanted to go to Sedona and Lowell Observatory and he took me there on our trip but he locked me in the hotel room, we never went to the observatory or even Lowell. He made me grind/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said \"but think about how id feel\" and pushed me down.

I finally convinced him to get some counseling maybe 6 months ago, and now he talks to a nice woman in the phone once a week, who seems helpful, and he has made some great strides recently in getting out more.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a large pile of issues between the agoraphobia and the ptsd, but what I\u2019m curious about today is the personality shift that tends to happen when he gets triggered and depersonalizes/derealizes. It starts with visible agitation and anxiety, which quickly progresses to becoming argumentative and aggressive and eventually be completely unable to listen to logic or follow any train of thought, mine or his. I spent years trying to talk things over or find any way to pacify him in those moments, but I generally found that once I realized what was happening, he was too far gone and too far into victim mode, and any words that came out of my mouth would just end up getting twisted and make things worse. \n\nOf course, one of his big triggers is abandonment issues, so as soon as I start to realize that he\u2019s in that place and try to extricate myself from the situation, it tends to escalate things. My latest \u201csolution\u201d has been to just freeze and go comatose while he rages at me and calls me an asshole for ignoring his pain, and wait for him to get some sleep.

Yes, sometimes this is made worse by alcohol but it\u2019s also been known to happen when he\u2019s dead sober. When he wakes up in the morning he can usually barely remember what has happened, is absolutely horrified at the way he\u2019s made me feel, and completely wracked with guilt. I\u2019m always incredibly upset and angry the next day, when it feels safe to do so, but it generally fades throughout the day as it feels useless to be angry at someone who isn\u2019t there anymore and who is punishing himself far more than I could.\n\nHe is the biggest, sweetest puppy dog, the type of guy who will spend a few minutes investigating each log before putting it into the fire to make sure no bugs will be burnt alive.

He has the most healing hands, he can take away the most debilitating pain with a simple head massage (I get the type of menstrual cramps that leave me screaming and throwing up on the bathroom floor).\n\nAnd yet - every now and then he leaves and in his place there is a man who is my nightmare. I know that at this point I have my own trauma to deal with from these nights. He\u2019s never hurt me and I\u2019m generally not physically frightened, but he has punched a few holes in the wall and there have been bad nights where he uses his size (we have a 14-inch, 100-lb difference) to try and stop me from leaving his house, towering over me and getting obvious pleasure from intimidating me, physically holding my car door closed so I cannot leave, or getting into my car with me and refusing to get out.\n\nI feel stupid as I write this, I feel like every stereotype of a girl blinded by love. \n\nMaybe I just needed to vent, or see this all written out.

I lost the apartment I was living in due to not paying rent and I ended up with a friend of his that lived in the complex and was also a tweaker and much older than me. This is where it got very bad, he was very sadistic and verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. He told me he was intentionally trying to make me go crazy, and he would just stand there and smile and taunt me when he got me to the point of crying. He talked about ways to kill me, and weird things like splitting my mind and making me reborn and being one of the \"elite\" by being tortured. Just really insane and confusing and he kept me in a constant state of anxiety to the point where I would have panic attacks when he wasn't home, especially after I found him hiding in the pantry when I thought he had left... he was physically abusive as well but it went deeper than the \"normal\" abuse because he would have a totally different voice, different face everything when he would talk about that weird stuff it literally scared me to my core because it was like being talked to by a demon... and he made me feel so dehumanized and worthless, he told me there were all these things wrong with me and I developed a fear of going outside which lead to me being trapped in the apartment with him for 7 months. I believe he drugged me as well as revenge for having him put in jail but that is a whole other long and horrible story. All of this happened in a short period of time. \n\nMy memory is really messed up when it comes to all of that. I don't know exactly when it began, and there are huge chunks of time missing. I actually had a point where I just \"woke up\" but I was sitting in my bed, I didn't remember ANYTHING for several minutes and even as things came back to me, I had this horrible weird feeling like my name and my room were not mine. I didn't know what I was doing before that and my bed and the furniture were moved and I still don't remember moving anything. I have never understood that but when this happened I returned to the abusive guy (I was all alone, as an addict he was the ONLY person who still talked to me and at that point I was convinced that I was crazy and none of the things he did happened) and he acted all emotional and told me some weird stuff about how it finally happened and that \"Caeley #1\" has died and I was now \"Caeley #2\". It made me feel more alone and terrified and I now wonder about the possibility of having DID (I had traumatic things happen as a child) or if it's part of PTSD and depersonalization/derealization disorder I've been diagnosed with. \n\nAnother thing I wonder about is why I am so emotionally detached from my memories. I remember it like it happened to someone else and I was watching, not like it happened to me. It makes me wonder if I even have PTSD at all. I only hear about people with PTSD being fearful and crying and everything but I am not like that, yet it still affects me and my life in other ways. Until recently (I think having a baby has changed it) I was unable to cry. I talk about it constantly, I think about it constantly, but it's the same memories over and over and I feel nothing when I think about them, just disturbed by the lack of feeling. I feel like not feeling anything makes it even harder to move past it... it's like I'm stuck. Like I blocked out the emotions then when they got too horrible to deal with and then I just stayed like that.

Once I stop talking about it, it goes away. It has made it difficult for me to explain everything to a therapist. It's very weird and I'm serious when I say I do not feel the anxiety whatsoever when I talk about it... it's just my body reacting that way.

Is there a type of therapist or someone that can help me connect to those memories and move past it?

I've been dealing with depression and generalized anxiety for over three years, so my life has been colourfully scattered with panic attacks and random depressive episodes. I worked really hard to ignore them and wait to seek treatment until I was an adult, as I was afraid that I was faking my symptoms and didn't have a problem because it was just \"teenager hormones\". I also have never been great at taking care of myself. When I entered college this year I was walking in, completely in denial about my issues and unprepared to take care of myself. \n\n\nIt took me only a week to have a melt down lmao. I had the worst panic attack of my life, I couldn't see and couldn't move and thought I was having a seizure. I quickly figured out that this wasn't working and sought a doctor who I later realized was not-great for treatment, who prescribed me Zoloft and Zopiclone, sleeping pills that I had previously had an addiction problem with. The Wednesday of my second week I immediately attempted suicide, had breakdowns every time I was left alone, downed pills like it was candy and was thankfully admitted to the hospital on Friday. There were so many fucking awful things I went through that week and I was out of control, and the suicide attempt scared the shit out of me. My therapist later told me the doctors theorized that my history of depression + my bad reaction to the Zoloft had led to my situation. I spent a week in a child psychiatric unit and dropped out of my college. There's so many other things I could talk about but this post is already long enough and that's not what this post is about.\n\n\nI'm terrified of what happened to me. I'm in a really great environment right now\u2014 I have an amazing support system, am able to stay in a lovely home with understanding parents who want the best for me. It's been almost two months now since the whole ordeal and I'm in recovery from my depression, seeing therapists and have a new doctor. I feel better. But I can't shake the experience and it keeps popping up.\n\n\nThe college I was at has offered me guaranteed admission into the winter semester, but I can't go back. When I returned to the college a couple days after I left the hospital I was fine, but I couldn't enter the bathroom I had a panic attack in. I was also roommates with a lifelong best friend of mine during this whole ordeal who I am no longer friends with because of how she dealt with everything. I can't stand the thought of going back to the college, the one I walked around in a drug-fuelled stupor and the one that contains an ex-childhood friend who dealt with my episode in the worst possible way. I'm also intensely afraid of going back to the way I used to be. I've never been one that's been afraid of the future, like going to college\u2014 these things have always excited me. But now things like school, work, living with roommates/independently; they scare the shit out of me. I have hazy memories of suffering from depression at night whilst pushing myself through shifts at work in the day or at school and I don't want to go through that again. I'm afraid to live with others and cause them problems again with my issues. Maybe I'm just being lazy, but the idea of going back to things like that stresses me out and has caused panic attacks. At the moment I am slated to get a job in the next week so I can work until January, then live with a friend in the city until summer, but the more I move closer to it the more I want to stay home until the next fall semester. I'm just scared of taking on responsibilities and putting myself through stress again, and letting others down. \n\n\nI was actually supposed to move in with a friend right away and went to live at her apartment for a trial week, and I wanted to leave after about three days and go home. I also slept in her bunk bed last Thursday night and woke up in the middle of the night, and thought for a moment I was back in my old college dorm (I slept in a bunk bed there too), remembered everything I went through and had a panic attack. \n\n\nOther mini-things like listening to old music I listened to, feeling anxiety/stress, having people ask me if I'm okay, deadlines etc. all are very likely to make me cry or get really pissed off and afraid. I constantly feel guilty asking things from anyone and I'm so vulnerable to stress that even the tiniest little things get me on edge and cause extreme reactions. I'm also having a big problem with memory since it is one of the side-effects of abusing Zopiclone; so much so that I barely remember my life before now and if I do I am not emotionally connected to them (I feel like a completely different person now, so doing stuff the \"old me\" does also makes me panic). \n\n\nSorry this is so long, I suppose this was sort of a vent as well, but I'm just really scared. I don't know if it's just a natural reaction to this sort of experience, it's PTSD, or it's just me being lazy? I'm saving this post so I can talk to my therapist about it but I just wanted the opinions of others. Is it possible to get PTSD from a suicide attempt/my experiences? Or does this just sound like a natural reaction, and if so\u2014 how long does this last?\n\n\nThe more things move the more I want them to slow down, and everyone in my life is trying their best to accommodate me so I feel bad asking them to do it even more. If I need to push through and do it, I want to try my best; but I don't want to push myself too hard and risk anything like this happening again.
