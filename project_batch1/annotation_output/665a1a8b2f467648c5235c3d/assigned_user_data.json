I remember this hopelessness before and I can still remember the difference after letting treatment work. \n\n I just feel like I either failed, or somewhere deep in my subconscious, gave up. I can't help but wonder if I subconsciously shut down whatever autonomic part of me has been constantly keeping vigilance because I want to be the old me again, and wallow in it because getting better is so exhausting, and affects my loved ones daily while me just being locked up lets them fucking live. [The fact that I have this pathetic narcissistic tendency is the other reason I ended up nonfunctional before, I'm aware of it. I leaned in back then and that weakness is always there.]\n\nThat's all.
