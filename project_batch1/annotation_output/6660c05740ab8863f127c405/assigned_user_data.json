I ignored him, and he got mad at me saying, \u2018all these privileged white people thinking they can be disrespectful\u2019. I looked back and gave him a death stare.

It was like 7:30pm, and it was pitch black because it was winter. I got out of school late because we had an open evening after school. This one is a bit more intense. As i said, there were guys lingering in an alleyway, and they had the smell of alcohol on them. I hadn\u2019t even realised they were there, but they grabbed me by the hair off the high street, pulled me into the alleyway and made me suck their dicks, forcing my head onto them and choking me until i threw up and almost fainted. \n\nA couple weeks ago, after christmas, i was in london and was gangraped in a freezing park and impregnated. I had it aborted like a week ago but that still sucks. And that wasn\u2019t the first abortion that i had to have. When i was 9, i was abducted and impregnated. That kid was also aborted.

When I was in middle school my older brother got into drugs and became a heroin addict shortly after. My mother would cry everyday and act coldly toward me and my little brother. She would go on fits of panic hyperventilating and pacing through our whole house and saying stuff like \u201cplease god just take my life instead of his\u201d. My dad would scream at my older brother horrible things and I don\u2019t blame him because my brother was horrible. He would steal things like my favorite video games and pawn them for drug money and I was too scared of upsetting my parents so I wouldn\u2019t tell them. I loved my brother so much I wanted to protect him even though he was ruining my life. I would find his burnt spoons and pills and just sob all night. I watched him but drugs from weird cars in front of our house when I\u2019d get home from school. Sometimes the drug cars would sit outside my house when I was home alone and I was so scared and confused. I would walk past his room and he would be sitting still with a blank expression staring at one corner of his room like a zombie. He actually overdosed and was dead until he was resuscitated in the ER. My parents would pay for different rehabs and they never worked. My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house. I felt so alone I would cut myself and make myself throw up or I would hysterically cry randomly at school or with friends. I wanted to just get in a car accident or find the courage to kill myself. I couldn\u2019t ever get help or tell my family because it would make the situation worse. All I wanted was for my mom to hug me and say everything was going to be okay. \n\nNow I\u2019m 19 and he\u2019s doing much better. He seems to be clean but you can never really be sure, but he seems much happier. But I am left with this scar that I don\u2019t think will ever go away. I fear drugs of any kind, I fear alcohol, I fear it all. Being around people doing those things make me panic on the inside. I do a good job usually of hiding it, but then I go home and cry. It\u2019s hard when everyone I know my age does all sorts of drugs and drinks. I\u2019ve lost friends, It\u2019s caused a breakup. I avoid movie scenes with drug use because it makes me that sick to my stomach and memes or people talking about drugs absolutely ruin my day. The thought of my boyfriend smoking or drinking still disturbs me greatly and makes me cry, but I don\u2019t want to control him. I know people use these things to find peace but I don\u2019t know why and it makes me so intensely upset. I wish I could protect everyone from these things but I can\u2019t. I know i sound crazy. I don\u2019t cry as much anymore. Sometimes the urge to hurt myself returns but I do well at suppressing that.

When I was in middle school my older brother got into drugs and became a heroin addict shortly after. My mother would cry everyday and act coldly toward me and my little brother. She would go on fits of panic hyperventilating and pacing through our whole house and saying stuff like \u201cplease god just take my life instead of his\u201d. My dad would scream at my older brother horrible things and I don\u2019t blame him because my brother was horrible. He would steal things like my favorite video games and pawn them for drug money and I was too scared of upsetting my parents so I wouldn\u2019t tell them. I loved my brother so much I wanted to protect him even though he was ruining my life. I would find his burnt spoons and pills and just sob all night. I watched him but drugs from weird cars in front of our house when I\u2019d get home from school. Sometimes the drug cars would sit outside my house when I was home alone and I was so scared and confused. I would walk past his room and he would be sitting still with a blank expression staring at one corner of his room like a zombie. He actually overdosed and was dead until he was resuscitated in the ER. My parents would pay for different rehabs and they never worked. My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house. I felt so alone I would cut myself and make myself throw up or I would hysterically cry randomly at school or with friends. I wanted to just get in a car accident or find the courage to kill myself. I couldn\u2019t ever get help or tell my family because it would make the situation worse. All I wanted was for my mom to hug me and say everything was going to be okay. \n\nNow I\u2019m 19 and he\u2019s doing much better. He seems to be clean but you can never really be sure, but he seems much happier. But I am left with this scar that I don\u2019t think will ever go away. I fear drugs of any kind, I fear alcohol, I fear it all. Being around people doing those things make me panic on the inside. I do a good job usually of hiding it, but then I go home and cry. It\u2019s hard when everyone I know my age does all sorts of drugs and drinks. I\u2019ve lost friends, It\u2019s caused a breakup. I avoid movie scenes with drug use because it makes me that sick to my stomach and memes or people talking about drugs absolutely ruin my day. The thought of my boyfriend smoking or drinking still disturbs me greatly and makes me cry, but I don\u2019t want to control him.
