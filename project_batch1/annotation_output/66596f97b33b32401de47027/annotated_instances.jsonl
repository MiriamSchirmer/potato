It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. I don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I don't know if he's evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest.\u00a0A good therapist can support you in these goals.

I'm tired of paying the punishment for his crime for him.\n\n I'm tired of the nightmares I have of him, of freezing up when I remember how he used to look or sound or feel or smell. I'm so sick of feeling severely physically ill every day because of all this. I've had to take a lot of time off from work, spend time and money on treatment, deal with debilitating physical and emotional pain from what he's done to me. On the worst days, I'm bed ridden, I've lost weight because eating is hard on a lot of days. He fueled an eating disorder that I'm trying to recover from and it makes my lack of appetite from this stress even more complicated to deal with. \n\nIt's unfair. I can't report him to the law, the police wouldn't be able to do anything. \n\nBut I hope he's still truck driving. I hope when he steps on a truck one day, he gets into a one vehicle accident and no one else is harmed but him. I wish he could burn alive, trapped inside his truck and have a long, painful, horrible and awful death.\n\n Would it fix any of this? No. I'd still be suffering, and he still would have abused me and threw a giant wrench into my entire life. But right now he's happy and he has a bunch of friends and he gets to go have fun everyday. I'm scared of every new person that comes along because what if they're like him? I've cut contact and blocked him everywhere, but what if he still finds a way back? I can't deal with people touching me anymore. Sometimes I'll have someone at work touch me and each time it makes me feel physically sick. \n\nHe's done all of this to me, and I'm enraged that he has gotten away with this unpunished. Everyday I find myself hoping that I'll hear that something bad has happened to him and that it will maybe be enough to make up for what he's done. \n\nBut I don't think he'll ever have to pay for any of this.

{"id": "2454_ptsd", "displayed_text": "2003 It happened in the fall of 2003. I was getting off the bus and a boy that lived in my neighborhood was walking to his house. I ran up and tackled him, as we have done many other days before. We would always wrestle, have snowball fights, goof off. Today was different. \n\nWhen he got up he grab my arms and I grabbed his back ready to wrestle. Thats when I felt something hit my in the ear hard and my leg buckled. I was then throw to the sidewalk and he laid on top of me and kept hitting me with his right fist into my left cheek. I remember trying to get up and saying \"Let me get up\" but kept getting punched in the side of my face. Then the back of my head was slammed into the concrete. I was then let up. I didn't know what to do. It was me, him and one \"friend\" just watching. He looked again, smiled, and came towards me. Again, I was thrown to the ground, hit in the side of the face multiple times, and had the back of my head slammed into the concrete. \n\nI walked home to find a knife, any weapon, but couldn't find anything but a brick in my front yard. I walked back to scare him to try and get him to back down. I didn't ever want to hurt anyone. I dropped the brick and again I was thrown to the ground, punched repeatedly and had my head slammed. It must have been 3,4,5 times. \n\nI walked home with that \"friend\" and immediately cried and broke down. This day has replayed in my head freqently ever since it happened. I turned to drugs at 14. Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything. Plotted suicide. \n\nIts been 15 years and it has been replaying in my head ever since. I have difficultly making friends. I stay home most weekends. I feel i will never amount to anything. On the outside I look successful. I work at a great company, I go to night class to further my career, I was a successful amateur boxer, I have a great family and girlfriend. But I cannot shake this event. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living. \n\nI started going to therapy consistently in 2016. I have done talk therapy, cbt, EMDR, energy healing,... I am lost. I hope I can get through this but there are times I feel I will never be confident. I still binge drink and still go through depressive spells. I wonder how my life would be if this didn't happen. It has been 15 years. \n\nIf you have taken the time to read this I really appreciate it. I know time is very valuable and this is a rambled wall of text.
