I was thrown back onto a construction fence, the only thing separating me from the water. Before I know it I was set upon, seeing strobe light like vision as my eyes were being punched repeatedly, my legs were brown from the dirt and being kicked relentlessly, and I was dodging and diving, swinging, trying to fend for myself, when I see one run up and plant a Stanley blade into my head, just above my eyebrow. It got stuck as the assault continued and part of my cheek was cut off with a much larger knife in an attempt to slice my eye out, they talked about finishing me and argued over who should have the knife and before I know it one charged aiming for my neck. I managed to grab his wrists and twist the hand but he put it through the skin in-between my thumb and index finger. I twisted his hand the whole way and felt a crack and he fell back causing his friends to look away. I dove to go over the barrier and was sliced down the entirety of my back and ran blacking in and out, pulled the knife out my head and collapsed in my own blood. When I awoke I walked myself to the hospital, got patched up, and tried to carry on. I was 17 at the time (now 18), and for a week or two I was fine. Then came the episodes. I would teleport back to that dockyard on repeat screaming and tangling my bedsheets, put my drink down in a bar and come around over a mile away as I'd just freaked out and ran and ran, with little to no memory of these episodes. I was and am a paranoid mess, and my gentle nature has become anxious and aggressive. I can't remember if I've clocked in at work, what I learn in classes, what I ate for breakfast, and when I did go on medication was so drowsy and whacked out my mind I couldn't learn either way. I fell asleep in work, classes, I stopped taking them. I now am back to essentially square one, and have already savaged one of my attackers when I seen him in broad daylight.

When we came to the path of the second bridge one grabbed my friend who I had overtook and went to stab him him the back. I tackled the man and my friends got away, however I was then cornered into a grassy clearing and questioned on where I was from, told they were going to drag me to the dark and kill me, and I resisted their attempts to drag me. I was thrown back onto a construction fence, the only thing separating me from the water. Before I know it I was set upon, seeing strobe light like vision as my eyes were being punched repeatedly, my legs were brown from the dirt and being kicked relentlessly, and I was dodging and diving, swinging, trying to fend for myself, when I see one run up and plant a Stanley blade into my head, just above my eyebrow. It got stuck as the assault continued and part of my cheek was cut off with a much larger knife in an attempt to slice my eye out, they talked about finishing me and argued over who should have the knife and before I know it one charged aiming for my neck. I managed to grab his wrists and twist the hand but he put it through the skin in-between my thumb and index finger. I twisted his hand the whole way and felt a crack and he fell back causing his friends to look away. I dove to go over the barrier and was sliced down the entirety of my back and ran blacking in and out, pulled the knife out my head and collapsed in my own blood. When I awoke I walked myself to the hospital, got patched up, and tried to carry on. I was 17 at the time (now 18), and for a week or two I was fine. Then came the episodes. I would teleport back to that dockyard on repeat screaming and tangling my bedsheets, put my drink down in a bar and come around over a mile away as I'd just freaked out and ran and ran, with little to no memory of these episodes. I was and am a paranoid mess, and my gentle nature has become anxious and aggressive. I can't remember if I've clocked in at work, what I learn in classes, what I ate for breakfast, and when I did go on medication was so drowsy and whacked out my mind I couldn't learn either way. I fell asleep in work, classes, I stopped taking them. I now am back to essentially square one, and have already savaged one of my attackers when I seen him in broad daylight. I moved out in November of last year to hide all this from my family, and have deadbolts on my door to lock myself away if I feel an episode coming on, and it is hell. Any advice?

Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn't feeling anxious? \u00a0What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about? \u00a0When was the last time I felt empathy? \u00a0What was different when I was able to feel empathy? \u00a0Hopefully this helps get you started."}, "1968_incel": {"id": "1968_incel", "text": "Even kissing before marriage is a sin.
