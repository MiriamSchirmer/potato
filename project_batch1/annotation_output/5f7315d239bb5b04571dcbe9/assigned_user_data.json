I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. Like my mother fucking pINCHED HER ARM and held it as tight as she could when she wasn\u2019t walking fast enough to her liking at a gas station. I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn\u2019t until I said something that she stopped. I think it\u2019s just because I\u2019m an adult now and she knows she can\u2019t scare me into shutting up when I see something shitty. \n\nNot even the worse part of the day? For me at least. Poor N probably is just tired of feeling like everything she does is wrong. Maybe I\u2019m projecting. I don\u2019t think so though. \n\nWe were out to eat with S who I haven\u2019t talked to in months. I texted her months ago when I was in a deep depression and basically went off on her about the dent in the back of my skull. It wasn\u2019t a lot. We were in an argument when I was probably 16. I turned around to walk away and she grabbed a can of food and just started hitting me over and over again in the back of my head. It hurts to this day. Every time I think about it I cry. \n\nANYWAY, out at dinner. First time I\u2019ve seen in S in months. M has convinced me to try and mend the relationship. I start off by saying I\u2019m sorry. I was immature about the way I went things and I should of just tried to talk to her about it because she\u2019s my sister and I love her. The entire time I\u2019m saying all this she\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m the most disgusting person on the planet. I finally stop and ask if everything is okay.

I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. Like my mother fucking pINCHED HER ARM and held it as tight as she could when she wasn\u2019t walking fast enough to her liking at a gas station. I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn\u2019t until I said something that she stopped. I think it\u2019s just because I\u2019m an adult now and she knows she can\u2019t scare me into shutting up when I see something shitty. \n\nNot even the worse part of the day? For me at least. Poor N probably is just tired of feeling like everything she does is wrong. Maybe I\u2019m projecting. I don\u2019t think so though. \n\nWe were out to eat with S who I haven\u2019t talked to in months. I texted her months ago when I was in a deep depression and basically went off on her about the dent in the back of my skull. It wasn\u2019t a lot. We were in an argument when I was probably 16. I turned around to walk away and she grabbed a can of food and just started hitting me over and over again in the back of my head. It hurts to this day. Every time I think about it I cry. \n\nANYWAY, out at dinner. First time I\u2019ve seen in S in months. M has convinced me to try and mend the relationship. I start off by saying I\u2019m sorry. I was immature about the way I went things and I should of just tried to talk to her about it because she\u2019s my sister and I love her. The entire time I\u2019m saying all this she\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m the most disgusting person on the planet. I finally stop and ask if everything is okay.

I could write a litany of things I adore about him but I won\u2019t subject the reddit community ;) Anyway he\u2019s been through some shit and I think only recently (a few yrs from retirement) has started to realize he may have some trauma related issues. We don\u2019t know if he has full blown ptsd or just some of the symptoms, but in my mind the label doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is that he (and I) are living things that I feel convinced are tied to the trauma he experienced. He\u2019s hesitant to get help or be diagnosed (not unwilling, just hesitant) because he\u2019s worried he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep working and he loves what he does, and of course the whole army mental health stigma thing. You know the drill. \n\nAnd I get it.\n\nBut we\u2019re already trying to navigate a long distance relationship, and when he\u2019s not doing well he goes through periods where he shuts down and shuts me (and everyone) out suddenly and for indefinite periods of time.\n\nThat\u2019s happening right now. And the thing is, I know I\u2019m just going to have to wait for him to resurface, there\u2019s really no other choice. I have almost only compassion and love for him, and while I feel upset and hurt on a personal level, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s about me \u2014 in fact I know it\u2019s not. I just want to be able to be there to support and love on him, and I don\u2019t want him to feel like a burden or a failure (got this from him, not my assumption). He\u2019s been infinitely patient and compassionate with my anxiety issues that would have thrown any guy for a loop, so I want to be able to do the same for him. It hurts when I can\u2019t.\n\nBut I just don\u2019t know how to handle these situations. Of course my anxiety and emotions go haywire when I just get shut out and don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll next hear from him.\n\nSo I guess I need insight. He\u2019s not telling me what he needs from me right now, or anything for that matter. I don\u2019t know what helps or hurts.

This past week (second week) I\u2019ve periodically reached out or tried to call, still to no effect. I\u2019ve tried to stay gentle in my messages and say that I love him and am here etc but just need to hear something from him. But he\u2019s not even opening messages and I have a hunch he\u2019s leaving his phone off now.\n\nMy best guess is that he\u2019s getting messages from a lot of family and loved ones and can\u2019t bear to answer or have to constantly ignore notifications. Which would mean he\u2019s really not in a good place. He\u2019s such a gentle and loving soul so I know it gives him pain to shut people he loves out, which tells me his overwhelm and/or depression is even more painful.\n\nSo I have only been able to respond to what I feel in determining how and whether to reach out. Not his needs since I don\u2019t know what they are. And so I don\u2019t know, does being persistent help or make it worse, or does it have no effect at all? I don\u2019t mean eight messages or calls a day. I never sent more than about two a day and now it\u2019s only every few days. I don\u2019t want to leave him isolated but I don\u2019t want to pile on more guilt that will push him deeper into a shutdown. And I\u2019m losing my mind not hearing from him. I miss him badly so it\u2019s pretty hard not to make efforts at contact in hopes of finally getting through. Last time this happened I just let him do his thing and waited for him to reach out, and it was almost a month before I heard from him. I don\u2019t think I can bear to do that again.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do.\n\nAnd yes, therapy is on the table and will be a discussion, but I just need insight on how best to deal right now. Or is there no definite answer and I\u2019m just gonna have to weather the suckiness of not knowing until he finally makes contact and I can ask him directly?\n\nI hate this \ud83d\ude16", "displayed_text": "When my s/o shuts me out and I think it\u2019s the trauma So, my s/o is an incredible guy who\u2019s given his whole life since he was 18 to the military. I could write a litany of things I adore about him but I won\u2019t subject the reddit community ;) Anyway he\u2019s been through some shit and I think only recently (a few yrs from retirement) has started to realize he may have some trauma related issues. We don\u2019t know if he has full blown ptsd or just some of the symptoms, but in my mind the label doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is that he (and I) are living things that I feel convinced are tied to the trauma he experienced. He\u2019s hesitant to get help or be diagnosed (not unwilling, just hesitant) because he\u2019s worried he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep working and he loves what he does, and of course the whole army mental health stigma thing. You know the drill. \n\nAnd I get it.\n\nBut we\u2019re already trying to navigate a long distance relationship, and when he\u2019s not doing well he goes through periods where he shuts down and shuts me (and everyone) out suddenly and for indefinite periods of time.\n\nThat\u2019s happening right now. And the thing is, I know I\u2019m just going to have to wait for him to resurface, there\u2019s really no other choice. I have almost only compassion and love for him, and while I feel upset and hurt on a personal level, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s about me \u2014 in fact I know it\u2019s not. I just want to be able to be there to support and love on him, and I don\u2019t want him to feel like a burden or a failure (got this from him, not my assumption). He\u2019s been infinitely patient and compassionate with my anxiety issues that would have thrown any guy for a loop, so I want to be able to do the same for him. It hurts when I can\u2019t.\n\nBut I just don\u2019t know how to handle these situations. Of course my anxiety and emotions go haywire when I just get shut out and don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll next hear from him.\n\nSo I guess I need insight. He\u2019s not telling me what he needs from me right now, or anything for that matter. I don\u2019t know what helps or hurts. The first week I was pretty persistent trying to get through, but then eventually realized it was no good.
