I have got myself into a real state with an emotional flashback to the day I tried to commit suicide. I just kept remembering how sad I was and how horrible it was and I couldn't stop crying. It's 2.52am and I want to go get some fresh air and make some tea but I'm scared I'll wake my parents. they know about my ptsd but it is still difficult to understand. I feel very scared and very alone, I want to wake my mum up really but I shouldn't.

I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. Like my mother fucking pINCHED HER ARM and held it as tight as she could when she wasn\u2019t walking fast enough to her liking at a gas station. I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn\u2019t until I said something that she stopped. I think it\u2019s just because I\u2019m an adult now and she knows she can\u2019t scare me into shutting up when I see something shitty. \n\nNot even the worse part of the day? For me at least. Poor N probably is just tired of feeling like everything she does is wrong. Maybe I\u2019m projecting. I don\u2019t think so though. \n\nWe were out to eat with S who I haven\u2019t talked to in months. I texted her months ago when I was in a deep depression and basically went off on her about the dent in the back of my skull. It wasn\u2019t a lot. We were in an argument when I was probably 16. I turned around to walk away and she grabbed a can of food and just started hitting me over and over again in the back of my head. It hurts to this day. Every time I think about it I cry. \n\nANYWAY, out at dinner. First time I\u2019ve seen in S in months. M has convinced me to try and mend the relationship. I start off by saying I\u2019m sorry. I was immature about the way I went things and I should of just tried to talk to her about it because she\u2019s my sister and I love her. The entire time I\u2019m saying all this she\u2019s looking at me like I\u2019m the most disgusting person on the planet. I finally stop and ask if everything is okay. Honestly I don\u2019t even remember what she said. It\u2019s fucking cliche but it\u2019s literally all a blur. This always happens. Whatever she said is just not even a memory. Whenever I\u2019m in conflict of any kind I can\u2019t remember what was said. My body like shuts down. I can barely hear my own thoughts. My vision has blurred in and out before. Lately when I\u2019m panicking I can\u2019t hear anything. It\u2019s scary. I don\u2019t know if these are symptoms. I got diagnosed with PTSD and haven\u2019t been back to the doctor since. It\u2019s fucking terrifying. \n\nI remember what I said before I walked out of the restaurant. Something shitty about her creepy ass boyfriend? (I only feel this way about him because he tried to fuck me when I was 16 and he was 20. She knew this. Is now living with him) \n\nI just stood at the back of the restaurant and trembled. I called my husband and just balled and asked him to pick me up. Felt like 5 minutes had passed but it\u2019d been 20.  My mom texted me my niece was upset so I went back in because I honestly hate that she even witnessed this disfunction.  \n\nI don\u2019t even know anymore. I just miss my family, but I hate them. I\u2019ve had so many traumatic experiences in my life and almost all of them (including being molested) were caused by FAMILY. It fucks with me.

{"id": "2659_ptsd", "displayed_text": "So, anyone have anything they'd like to vent about? CONTENT/TRIGGER WARNING: Detailed story of child abuse, near-death experiences, guns, animal death\n\nI have PTSD from childhood abuse from my step-father (who I was raised to believe was my biological father) and from my mother who neglected me a lot throughout my life until I moved out.\n\nI haven't lived with my mom and step-dad since 2011 and I still have vivid nightmares and flashbacks from my childhood.\n\nOne thing that I'd like to share with you all is a certain situation my step-dad put my family in. It was 2012, I was living with my grandparents, but went to Chuck E. Cheese with my mom, step-dad, and brother because my mom wanted me to go with them.\nEverything was going okay until we left and got inside my step-dad's truck.\n\nMy step-dad has a permit to open carry a pistol, which I still have no idea how he was able to even get that gun, but then again, 'murrica. He caries that damn thing with him everywhere.\n\nAnyways, we were all sitting in the truck, step-dad in driver's seat, mom in passenger seat, and my brother and me in the backseat. Out of the blue, my step-dad locks the doors of the vehicle and takes out his pistol. As soon as I saw him do this, I just thought to myself, \"great, we're all going to die now.\" He pointed the barrel at our heads, smiling and waving his gun around like it was a toy. He almost never keeps the safety on.\n\n\"I could kill all of you right now, just put a bullet in all of your heads,\" he said, laughing, still waving the gun around.\n\n\"(S-D's name), please stop, you're scaring us!\" My mom cried.\n\nHe pointed the gun at her and told her, \"shut the fuck up!\"\n\nThen my mom said, \"this is why OP doesn't want to be around us anymore!\"\n\nMy step-dad groaned and put away his pistol, claiming that my mom always has to \"ruin the fun\" and then drove me back to my grandparents' house.\n\nAbout a year after he had gotten the gun (back in 2009), I was sitting in the living room watching War of the Worlds. Suddenly, he just pulled his pistol out in the living room, stood up, pointed the gun at me, and pulled the trigger. I screamed so loud and tried to cover myself up. I remember the feeling of the adrenaline rushing through my veins and feeling so helpless. Then, I heard him laugh at me and said, \"OP, stop being fucking ridiculous, the magazine's not even in!\"\n\nWell, he ended up accidentally killing his dog back in 2012. He took his sleeping pills before cleaning out his gun. The magazine was out, but there was a bullet stuck in the chamber. He accidentally pulled the trigger. It went straight through his arm chair and hit his dog in the head. She yelped slightly and tried to walk away before she slumped down and passed on. Luckily, I didn't have to witness that situation first hand (my mother had told me when I asked where the dog was when I was visiting her once).\n\nThat's not the only abusive thing that he's done, but it's been replaying in my mind ever since the school shooting in Florida.\n\nThe only ones I've told these stories to are my boyfriend, a couple trusted friends, and two therapists.\n\nIt terrifies me whenever people ask me how I feel about gun control. I feel like they will think I'm being ridiculous when I tell them I support stricter gun regulations, but honestly, if an abusive man with mental illness can LEGALLY get a firearm and threaten to shoot his family, pretend to shoot his own kid, and accidentally kill his dog with it, there should obviously be some sort of stricter regulations.\n\nI haven't reported him. I've always been afraid to. My mom would always tell me as a child to not tell ANYONE that he abused me because she didn't want her kids taken away from her. That's still engraved in my brain, even to this day. Even the thought of reporting him gives me waves of anxiety.\n\nHe still has that gun and he still is legally allowed to open-carry.

We moved to our current location after I accepted a job position about two years ago, and he had his little brother move down about four months after that. We all got really close. Flash forward to October 2018.\n\nHe and his brother work out of town, on the morning of the incident his little brother was killed right in front of him for absolutely no reason, seriously, no reason. He blames himself, has been in and out of rehab centers (he uses illicit drugs, and most recently, alcohol) to numb himself and avoid reality. Our family lives about 14 hours from us, so really it\u2019s just him and me. \n\nPlease understand I am not trying to portray myself as a victim. I just honestly don\u2019t know what to do. He doesn\u2019t want to face what happened and work through the trauma, he just tries numbing it. Everything gets taken out on me. I listen, boy do I listen, to every detail of what happened that morning. I understand it is good for him to get it out, but I am not a licensed therapist. He refuses to see a professional.

I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.

I had a group of friends since 2004, and remained friends with them up until 2014 when I finally cut communications with them. They were a very toxic group of racist, sexist, and narcissistic people. The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. \n\n1. The \"leader\" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like \"You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?\". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending \"laugh\" like \"Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.\n2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.\n3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.\n4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like \"go kill yourself no one loves you\"\n5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.\n6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life. He was the only one I kept in more recent contact, but I noticed some of his personality traits were very similar to the group.  He would do the same mocking laugh the leader did, the same type of criticism that the leader's favorite and the white supremecist did. And at a recent party, I found out he was trying to hit on girlfriends of my friends, and made a lot of people uncomfortable. After realizing all this, I realized he is just as bad as that old group and I cut him off.\n\nOver 5 years have passed since then, and I still think about this. I feel like I wasted so much of my potential and energy during college and feel this is part of why I'm struggling so much in the present.
