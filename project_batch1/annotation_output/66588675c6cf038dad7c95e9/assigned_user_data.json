I was still trying to get it back together because I couldn't explain it at the ER and I didn't want insurance make me have to face him in court. I should have seen it coming. Three months before that, he screamed in my face and grabbed me by the shoulders. I ignored the blazing red flags. I still experience daily pain. Roughly twelve hours before that he'd shoved me over the couch (I have a serious back injury which I finally had my spine fused for recently, and that has long been a huge no no for me) and yanked my pants down to try to fuck me while his 4 y.o. daughter was in the bathroom. He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly. I was shocked because he hadn't done anything like that in the 11.5 months we'd been together, but as a testament to my prior experiences with abuse, I saw it as nothing terribly abnormal. This was what I'd always known relationships to be, whether it be family, friends, or intimate relationships.\n\nI was supposed to move in with them in a couple weeks. I wanted to wait until a year in, because I knew deep down he was a bad guy, but I wanted to be wrong. I wanted to be a mom (I can't have kids), and I wanted to save his daughter from the life I had growing up. He used this all against me. He's a narcissist and has some severely anti-social tendencies. \n\nLast night I had a nightmare involving me babysitting for him and his ex-wife, and their friends drugging me to rape me when they brought the party home. It brought back all the bad and my husband (we met two years ago next month) has super-hearing abilities and heard me crying while he was in the bathroom getting ready for work. He came out to hold me. Now he's gone and I'm crying again, damn it. It brought back all the memories of all the physical and sexual assaults and rapes I've experienced. People like that can smell a victim a mile away. \n\nThe shame is so overwhelming right now. That I let it happen. My entire life. From the first time I didn't say anything aged six. I just want to forget. I don't want to feel these people touching me. So many people, so many times, I've literally lost count. The things I've let happen because I never understood that people who love you don't hurt you like that. Things I let happen because I was conditioned to believe from such a young age that that is what life is. Hiding, hurting, and being used. Because I never saw the value in myself as a person. I still don't. I'm a garbage person. \n\nMy husband was the first to tell me that it wasn't normal to let myself be an object. A fuck toy and a punching bag. I had just accepted my fate that it was my place to be used and abused. That my normal was to live in fear of being hurt or fucked. I was 34 when we met. Now, after all the years of being used like a Kleenex, I feel so dirty, ashamed, and undeserving of someone as wonderful as he is. I feel like if he truly knew all that had happened, all the things I let happen, though I've shared a lot with him, that he would be disgusted. He's a better person than that, I know. But I feel unworthy of love, and unworthy of the safety I have with him now. This morning I told him I often wonder if I'd met him sooner, if I'd believe him or just brush him off as some bullshit fairytale who would eventually hurt me in the same ways. It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that.\n\nI'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all. A couple months ago I asked my psychiatrist if ECT would make me forget. Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. \n\nTl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.

Feel embarrassed by my lack of experience with men which is a consequence of PTSD.\n\nI have struggled with this for a long time and I have avoided posting about it because I have been afraid of people confirming these feelings. I have been on medication prescribed to me for PTSD for a few years now and this has been my only way of allowing myself to feel valid. I don't tell people about my PTSD but when I have to I feel like I need to somehow slip the fact that I am medicated into the disclosure so that I will be taken seriously. When I say \"have to\" I am referring to situations such as the time I signed up for a self defense class and I needed them to know not to get on top of me in any way (will make sense later) and that I needed a female teacher. I needed to mention the PTSD for context. \n\nA little background: I have always had a fear of men and I can't really pinpoint when it started or why, but it was always more severe than the unfortunately common intimidation that many women tend to feel. I remember feeling this way as early as 7 or 8. I would avoid men in general. Experiences such as being cat called and followed in my early teens made it worse. \n\nThe experience which really caused my PTSD happened just after i moved away from home for college. I was at a friends house one night and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up in the middle of the night with a guy 'friend' straddling me and giving me hickeys and trying to take off my clothing. I told him to get off me multiple times and he didn't. I curled up into a fetal position until he gave up and left. It felt like he was on top of me for hours but I'm guessing it was more like 15 or 20 minutes. Nothing more happened, he got off me and fell asleep somewhere in the apartment, but it left me anxious and depressed for months.  I felt dirty and guilty. I couldn't look men in the eyes and any romantic attention from men felt even more threatening than it did for me already, even if I knew that they were probably very nice guys. Because of this I have never had a boyfriend. Never slept with a man. The first and last time I had sexual contact with a man was when I woke up to someone who I thought I could trust sucking on my neck and putting his hand under my blanket. I am nearly 25 now. Its embarrassing to me and I am afraid that, at this point, if I manage to move past the anxiety of male attention that I will scare away any man with my lack of experience.\n\nThat was the first one. The second event, which blew everything up, was when I was jumped walking home at night. I am a runner and a lot stronger than I look as a small woman and managed to get away. It left me so traumatized, though, because I tried really hard to get help and no one would help me. The security guard at my apartment building told me to stop talking and tell the female security guard who was only going to be working 4 days later, and the police laughed at me when I described what happened. (Might sound unlikely but I was living in another country at this time and this isnt uncommon behavior there).\n\nAt this point I would physically start to shake if I was hanging out with a man and he got touchy. Panic attack symptoms minus hyperventilation. \nI would feel my body go cold and my muscles seize up. There was a situation when I was trying to get over this all and had been on a few dates with a guy. He kissed me and all was fine until he touched my thigh and I started having a panic attack. I was so embarrassed and humiliated because he immediately left the room to tell him roommates. Yes, I know, I found myself an asshole.\n\nThat left me with really unhealthy views of men (even more than before) and I genuinely believed for a very long time that men did not feel love and that any appearance of love was purely a form of manipulation. These experiences along with an unfortunate mother (who would tell me things like \"all men cheat\") caused me to be so scared to fall in love because to me that would mean being a slave. It took me a very long time to realise that men do feel love. People will probably be wondering this: my father is in my life and he is a good man. One of the most honest and loving people I know. No issues there.\n\nAnyway, here I am years later. I have been through therapy, take antianxiety/antidepressants and have managed to cut down my PTSD meds to \"as needed\". So, Prazosin when I have nightmares, and that's all. I still get incredibly uncomfortable with men touching me and i am terrified of sex and it stops me from pursuing men I like. I am so worried that they will not be patient with me and that i am embarrassing. \n\nIt's also hard to know when to bring this up with a man because I dont want to scare him off but at the same time I dont want him to scare me off by going at a pace I cant handle. \n\nTo bring it back to my post title....I feel like a fraud.

I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said \"what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?\" I said I didn't know what was wrong. \n\nAfter they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. \n\nThey discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a \"nasty fever\" and told me to rest for a few days.\n\nAt 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. \n\nPositive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood.

They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). \n\nNow I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well \"hey, she didn't have cancer\" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. \n\nI constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that.

But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  \nI had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either.
