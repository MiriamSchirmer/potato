It used to make me agoraphobic because I was so convinced I was going to have a heart attack and die &amp; really interrupted my ability to function &amp; would go months at a time without leaving my house at all. I worked through that and although I still get the racing heart when I have to do things that relate to the PTSD, I am able to tell myself that it\u2019s temporary and will go away when the situation is over.  I used to take 6 msg of Xanax a day just to get out my front door and now I don\u2019t need anything. \n\nProblem is that I also have ADHD which I do require medication for...I get goldfish brain to the point I had 3 car accidents in 3 weeks off medication. At my last visit the guy I saw had issues with my heart rate and told me to see my pcp &amp; get clearance to continue on the medication I was taking. I\u2019ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don\u2019t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn\u2019t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn\u2019t be enough and he\u2019d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nOn top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I\u2019m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I\u2019m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we\u2019re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they\u2019d be better off because now I\u2019m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control. He made me fill out the depression questionnaire (I was previously treated for major depression with TMS &amp; am on Prozac still) and I answered honestly about thinking my family would be better off if I was dead nearly every day and I was going to tell him that I was feeling very guilty about the impact of my mental health on my family. But he never picked up or even looked at the form. I left truly believing my family would be better off without me because now everything is about to get much worse for me and therefore them. So I\u2019m obsessing about dying suddenly but also thinking I should die for the sake of my family. \n\nThis whole event just upset me so much it made me start thinking about the whole traumatic event again in detail.and how unfair it is that the person that caused all this did 6 years in prison but got to move on with his life. And here I am 20 years later feeling sentenced to life. I know I\u2019m going to be right back to having flashbacks and panic attacks and seeing his face in every stranger. I really wish I could restart this day and never go to that appointment. \n\nAll of this could be over if I could just not have situational heart rate spikes but he offered me no solutions to what I can do about that. I\u2019m hoping someone here has had similar issues and how you handled it. It\u2019s not related to the medication because I\u2019ve had this for decades even unmedicated and I purposely didn\u2019t take it the last 3 days out of fear of this exact thing happening.

I used to take 6 msg of Xanax a day just to get out my front door and now I don\u2019t need anything. \n\nProblem is that I also have ADHD which I do require medication for...I get goldfish brain to the point I had 3 car accidents in 3 weeks off medication. At my last visit the guy I saw had issues with my heart rate and told me to see my pcp &amp; get clearance to continue on the medication I was taking. I\u2019ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don\u2019t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn\u2019t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn\u2019t be enough and he\u2019d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nOn top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I\u2019m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I\u2019m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we\u2019re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they\u2019d be better off because now I\u2019m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control. He made me fill out the depression questionnaire (I was previously treated for major depression with TMS &amp; am on Prozac still) and I answered honestly about thinking my family would be better off if I was dead nearly every day and I was going to tell him that I was feeling very guilty about the impact of my mental health on my family. But he never picked up or even looked at the form. I left truly believing my family would be better off without me because now everything is about to get much worse for me and therefore them. So I\u2019m obsessing about dying suddenly but also thinking I should die for the sake of my family. \n\nThis whole event just upset me so much it made me start thinking about the whole traumatic event again in detail.and how unfair it is that the person that caused all this did 6 years in prison but got to move on with his life. And here I am 20 years later feeling sentenced to life. I know I\u2019m going to be right back to having flashbacks and panic attacks and seeing his face in every stranger. I really wish I could restart this day and never go to that appointment. \n\nAll of this could be over if I could just not have situational heart rate spikes but he offered me no solutions to what I can do about that. I\u2019m hoping someone here has had similar issues and how you handled it. It\u2019s not related to the medication because I\u2019ve had this for decades even unmedicated and I purposely didn\u2019t take it the last 3 days out of fear of this exact thing happening. So even if I just didn\u2019t take it anymore, I\u2019m still going to have these spikes that he says could stop my heart."}, "1940_counseling": {"id": "1940_counseling", "text": "There are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart.

What chance do I have?\", self harmed for a year after I left the army which concluded in a suicide attempt which left a huge scare over my chest which also reminds me. \n\nNever thought anything about it, I could not see my own problems and when I did I didn't link it to PTSD as \"I haven't experienced anything traumatic\". Just pushing anything related to that away subconsciously. The psychologist said that they called it \"the evading illness\" internally as it's extremely common to just block it all and say that you are fine.\n\nWell, you people know all that. \n\nI don't know. I just had to write something about it that says \"hey this happened\" to myself. Between this and the surgery I'm struggling to find the will to go on. All I see before me is a mountain I don't have the strength to climb. \n\nI got homework to ready as much as I can about PTSD but so far I've been avoiding it and just shitpost on reddit instead. I remember he asked if there was anything I wanted to do, like a goal, I could not answer because I don't get joy from anything - but today I realized what I wanted. I want to stop.\n\nNo real reason to post this. I'm going to anyway, not even on a throwaway because this is real and happening no matter what I think."}, "1769_ptsd": {"id": "1769_ptsd", "text": "I want to help my friend She has ptsd.
