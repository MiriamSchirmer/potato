{"id": "2430_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Having a hard time opening up to loved ones TW for all of this (rape, assault)\n\nI\u2019m 20 years old, female. When I was freshly 16, I was raped during a party in a small apartment, with the door open, and nobody helped me. I began acting out and getting in a lot of trouble after this, ultimately landing myself in acute inpatient for suicidal thoughts. I wrote my parents a letter telling them what happened to me, and social workers had to come in the hospital and report it with me. They never, ever contacted me or my parents EVER again. That alone is its own damage. \n2 years later, freshly 18 now, I began working as a houseman in a hotel. This means I cleaned everything except for inside the actual rooms. Well, there was a man that would stay Monday-Thursday for his construction job. He took an interest in me quickly, asking my age, where I go to school, then progressing into telling me I have \u201cbeautiful bedroom eyes\u201d and \u201cpure ness in my smile\u201d I knew he was up to something. He then began asking me which car is mine, when do I get off work, will my parents be waiting on me to come home from work tonight, etc. I began to be paranoid even when I left work, getting trapped in moments of my 16 year old self, thinking nobody cares what would happen to me, because after all, the police don\u2019t care about me.  At one point he entered the lady\u2019s restroom where I was cleaning, had me in a corner, touched my arm and asked how I like the new job. :( \nOne day, and this is so hard for me to tell because it became a repressed memory until my second hospitalization in October 2019, I was vacuuming the second floor hallway. Humming to myself probably, at the very start of this floor, the door to my left opened quickly. An arm, with orange hair and freckles, oh my god this is it, an arm grabs me. It was the man. He held me just inside the room, my left foot in the doorway. He told me to look in his eyes, gripped my arm tighter, and held me there. I was thinking to myself that this is it, he has me. He could\u2019ve done whatever he wanted. It felt like my eyes were looking into his for years, and his eyes, they were like... glass. Empty, yet fiery.  My mind made me see myself, naked, beaten, raped, and left all alone in the woods to rot. He let me go and I finished my shift. I was in a state of denial, showing up to my following shift in the morning. When I got to the second floor again, I actually passed out, and I\u2019ve never passed out! I completely fell to the ground, it felt like I swallowed a rock. \nLong story, but my entire 2018 consisted of horrible paranoid thoughts and migraines, but I had forgotten this incident for a long time, so my therapist and I had a hard time getting it under control. Now that I remember, my life is bad. I have also borderline personality disorder that causes me MUCH distress on a daily basis, but now I\u2019m miserable. I have flashbacks during the day time, I can\u2019t even take the trash out alone. I\u2019ve lost all my friends. My relationships are shallow and meaningless, except for my boyfriend. I never feel safe. I have gotten to the point of accusing my father of trying to rape me (absolutely delusional, he\u2019s never touched me) and had similar accusations to my friends and even my boyfriend at some points. Sometimes, when the flashbacks are bad and I can\u2019t afford to buy my medical marijuana, I get stuck in loops of seeing my dead and raped body again. It\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m scared to tell my family what happened because it seems like... nothing happened.

Just a warning that this post deals with triggering and graphic subjects! \n\n\nHey, I'm 16 and have been dealing with PTSD since 2014 and just recently relived a very similar event and caused me to lose all my progress. Feeling lost and have no clue what to do anymore.\n\nBack in 2014 on christmas eve I saw a man get shot and killed while shopping for a ring for my mother. I was about 11 or 12 at the time and just didn't really know how to cope or understand it so I blocked it out until around 2017 when I accepted the fact that I did/do have PTSD and tried to acknowledge and work with it more.

Life will be life, though. Shit happens and people are still just as cruel and senseless as they've always been.\n There's many more aspects to the murder that I'm scared to open up about that are also causing me issues but all I can say is that the victim won't get justice, the system in the tiny town I'm at is fucked and corrupted. \n\n\nI just really needed a place to let this out at for now until I am able to figure out whatever else I can do to help myself.

PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE QUESTION IF YOU CAN, EVEN IF YOU DON\u2019T READ THE REST!\n\n\n\nHere is the long backstory you don\u2019t have to read, since I really just want to know how other people have treated elevated heart rate related to PTSD:\n\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m about to end up being treated for a heart condition I don\u2019t have, as I only have heart rate spikes temporarily when my anxiety is triggered. It used to make me agoraphobic because I was so convinced I was going to have a heart attack and die &amp; really interrupted my ability to function &amp; would go months at a time without leaving my house at all. I worked through that and although I still get the racing heart when I have to do things that relate to the PTSD, I am able to tell myself that it\u2019s temporary and will go away when the situation is over.  I used to take 6 msg of Xanax a day just to get out my front door and now I don\u2019t need anything. \n\nProblem is that I also have ADHD which I do require medication for...I get goldfish brain to the point I had 3 car accidents in 3 weeks off medication. At my last visit the guy I saw had issues with my heart rate and told me to see my pcp &amp; get clearance to continue on the medication I was taking. I\u2019ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don\u2019t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn\u2019t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn\u2019t be enough and he\u2019d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nOn top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I\u2019m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I\u2019m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we\u2019re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they\u2019d be better off because now I\u2019m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control. He made me fill out the depression questionnaire (I was previously treated for major depression with TMS &amp; am on Prozac still) and I answered honestly about thinking my family would be better off if I was dead nearly every day and I was going to tell him that I was feeling very guilty about the impact of my mental health on my family. But he never picked up or even looked at the form. I left truly believing my family would be better off without me because now everything is about to get much worse for me and therefore them. So I\u2019m obsessing about dying suddenly but also thinking I should die for the sake of my family. \n\nThis whole event just upset me so much it made me start thinking about the whole traumatic event again in detail.and how unfair it is that the person that caused all this did 6 years in prison but got to move on with his life. And here I am 20 years later feeling sentenced to life. I know I\u2019m going to be right back to having flashbacks and panic attacks and seeing his face in every stranger. I really wish I could restart this day and never go to that appointment. \n\nAll of this could be over if I could just not have situational heart rate spikes but he offered me no solutions to what I can do about that. I\u2019m hoping someone here has had similar issues and how you handled it. It\u2019s not related to the medication because I\u2019ve had this for decades even unmedicated and I purposely didn\u2019t take it the last 3 days out of fear of this exact thing happening. So even if I just didn\u2019t take it anymore, I\u2019m still going to have these spikes that he says could stop my heart.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2829, "end": 2867, "span": " What if my heart stops while driving ", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 17s "}}
