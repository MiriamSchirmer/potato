So Jamie and I had a lot in common, and immediately became friends. I was new in town and she was my first friend.\n\nThe trouble started a year later, (I was 12 at this point, yup I know I'm young) when she started making some horrible comments. For example I told her I was bullied at my last school and she smirked and said \"Oh, so you're an easy target\" It felt weird, I wasn't sure how to react.\n\nLater, when school started again, she kept making comments like those or about my body. I definitely was an early bloomer and she was as well, but she really bugged me about some things about myself.\n\nThen, she molested me. Several times.\n\nAt first it was subtle touches, and she told me she was just physical with friends. I thought it was weird because she wasn't that way with other people.\n\nThen it got worse, like a lot worse. Not rape, but intense making out etc.\n\nSo that happened at the end of the school year and I didn't see her over the summer.\n\nIt was the worse summer of my life, and when school started I was extremely suicidal. At this point, I told a close friend. They helped me a lot.\n\nJamie took it way too far a few days ago. I'm shaken over it. I just want to get her out of my life.\n\nJamie is still abusing me.\n\nBut here's my problem. I want to report Jamie, I really do. But I feel like I can't for two main reasons\n\n1. She's popular at my small school, everyone knows her. It's a private school, so everyone knows each other anyways but she seems like such a nice person on the outside.\n2.

Over the last year I've worked through DBT skills group to help me learn new coping skills in preparation for PE. But now that I've completed group and it's time to start PE my therapist thinks I'm not ready. She doesn't think that I've stopped blaming myself and that PE right now will only make things worse for me. I don't know what to do with that information because I don't know how to stop blaming myself.\n\nA little background, I'll put as much as my brain will let me. Seven years ago my only child passed away. His death was in part due to hospital error. I know you're probably thinking \"That sounds like the hospital's fault not yours.\" but hear me out. There was a sequence of events that lead to his death, and in this sequence of events there were times I could have done something and didn't. I made several conscious decisions as things unfolded. I saw with my own eyes that the hospital wasn't following protocol. I knew this because they had already explained the protocol and we had to sign releases giving them permission explicitly for this particular treatment. I knew this. But when I saw them breaking that protocol I was too damned scared to say anything. I was too much of a coward to face my fear of confronting the staff to say anything and I __chose__ to stay quiet. Later, I had a second opportunity to speak up and I again chose not to. Then, when things had progressed too far, they believed his heart was beginning to fail and asked us if they should resuscitate, but that it might not do any good. My wife was too scared to answer so __I made the decision to let him go__. I made the decision to let my own child die.\n\nI feel like the hospital metaphorically put a loaded gun to my child's head and I saw it happening and did absolutely nothing to stop it. I may not have pulled the trigger but I saw what was happening and my own cowardice stopped me from doing anything.\n\nHow do I not blame myself for this? How do I let go of feeling like I played a part in this when I made actual conscious decisions that lead up to my own child's death? I'm being told that PE is my best hope and chance of getting better but that I can't do it until I'm ready to stop blaming myself. But I have no fucking clue how to do that.

She finally stabilised today, and the vet was frankly shocked that she survived. He's running some tests now to determine what caused this episode (GI stasis and hypothermia, in case you were wondering). Thing is, this is a huge trigger for me and I have no idea why. \n\nThe things that happened to me when I was a child were physical in nature for the most part, the only \"traumatic\" event I can think of that involved a pet was when my mother accidentally reversed over our (very old and deaf) cat while I was in the car. It was upsetting certainly, but compared to the other things that happened it seems \"minor\".\n\nWe lost another rabbit about 6 months ago to a tumor on her heart, and that broke me. I had to take time off work (I still haven't gone back) and that episode finally pushed me to seek therapy. At the time, I saw it more as the straw that broke the camel's back, but now I'm wondering if maybe there's something more.\n\nI fucking hate this all consuming anxiety. I can barely function. I can't eat, I barely sleep, I've had constant nightmares, and I've just burned through my anti-anxiety meds.

I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"new version\" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year.
