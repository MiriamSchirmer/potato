I lost my BF whom I love with my whole heart just before 2020. It ended up in him saying that he does not want to deal with me anymore, that I have a part of me that is absolute trash and that he is done trying and does not want to contact me anymore and just wants to find someone else to love to repair what I broke. That crushed me.\n\nSo I went no contact for 2 weeks now, even though it is very hard because I have so much anxiety about people leaving me.

My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven\u2019t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it\u2019s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don\u2019t resolve any issues. And it\u2019s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn\u2019t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it\u2019s taken a full toll on me.\n\nThe relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn\u2019t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father\u2019s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad\u2019s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn\u2019t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I\u2019m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I\u2019m terrified about my future and whether I\u2019ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I\u2019m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn\u2019t that good to start with. My parents don\u2019t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).\n\nRight now I don\u2019t feel safe and I don\u2019t know what to do.

My partner\u2019s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.\n\nIt\u2019s father\u2019s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven\u2019t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it\u2019s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don\u2019t resolve any issues. And it\u2019s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn\u2019t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it\u2019s taken a full toll on me.\n\nThe relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn\u2019t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father\u2019s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad\u2019s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn\u2019t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I\u2019m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I\u2019m terrified about my future and whether I\u2019ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I\u2019m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn\u2019t that good to start with. My parents don\u2019t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).\n\nRight now I don\u2019t feel safe and I don\u2019t know what to do. This post didn\u2019t really have a question - I am just massively triggered right now and want to vent my story anonymously.
