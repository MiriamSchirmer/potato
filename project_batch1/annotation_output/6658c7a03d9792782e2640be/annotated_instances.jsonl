We recently had a major incident at my workplace that resulted in some of my close coworkers being very seriously injured, and one of our clients being arrested. I wasn\u2019t actually present at the time it happened, but I was there in the aftermath to clean things up, and help others figure out the rest of their schedules for the week. I feel awful for feeling traumatized, but at the same time, I left only moments before the incident occurred and it happened very close to my office. The room reeked of old blood and the atmosphere felt tense and scary. I never thought my work family and I would go through something like this.

{"id": "655_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Online gore can destroy you. I brought this to myself. I might be the most stupid man I know.. I'm sorry, it'll be a long story.\n\nThe first thing I remember being related to this would be when I was 11. I ended up with a picture of an 18yo corpse, in midst of the most disgusting putrefaction. I'd never dared to imagine that was what was coming to me when I'll end up dead. Of course, you can imagine it traumatized me. I couldn't sleep for weeks, I was terrified of the dark and this picture haunted me, forced itself into my mind and I saw it literally everywhere.\n\nIt sounds stupid. I know. It gets worse.\n\nI developed, what I understood way later, something called as necrophobia. I realized it when my mother died 2 years ago. I barely mourned her, or maybe I did but in a really quiet and subtle way I still do not understand. I couldn't show up to her burying. It was definitely impossible. I just said goodbye to her while she was getting medicated and ran off when they decided to euthanize her. I couldn't get to see her for the last time as something that terrifies me. I just couldn't. I can't describe it. There was no way.\n\nYet.. something did change. I changed.. a bit. I developed a close relationship to death. Not in a way that makes me want to join her. But a sense of morbidity and nihilism I did not know I had. \n\nIt developed further as I wanted to confront myself. To make these flashes stop. Just like I did when I was terrified of bees. I decided to confront my fears, to watch death in front of my very eyes. To rationalize it. To be, let's say.. desensitized.\n\nThis was the poorest choice of my life. I ended up watching dozens and dozens of pictures, videos. I saw dead people. I saw dying people. Various ways. Horrendous ways. I really don't want to tell what I saw. I'm not made for this. I've never been made for this. Now I'm back to being 11. But 10x worse. I have regular flashbacks of these, each time I turn the lights off. Each time I see a violent clip in a movie or a strange music plays on. It's been months, and it stained me. It damaged me. I can't stop thinking about my mother now. What she endured. What she felt. My stomach tightens whenever it crosses my mind. I fear I might have developed PTSD.. or I maybe I dug an old one up. I feel totally lost. And it hurts so much. I feel like I brought this on myself. \n\n\nTLDR : I'm weak and stupid. Never watch these.
