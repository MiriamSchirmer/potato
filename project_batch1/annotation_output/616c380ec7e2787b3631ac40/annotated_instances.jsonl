It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. I don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I don't know if he's evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest.\u00a0A good therapist can support you in these goals.

{"id": "1524_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD from forced sex work A bit of background here - I (29 F) was heavily involved in the drug scene back in my early twenties. Prior to that, in high school, I was very promiscuous (possibly as a result of taking medication meant for depression while actually being bipolar, perhaps sending me into a mania).\n\nIn my drug phase, there were lots of times I\u2019d have sex for drugs. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t expect it - thinking that I could just pay the guy for my drugs like a normal transaction, but they ended up not wanting the money and I\u2019d give in. \n\nthe climax of it all happened when I was desperately looking for a fix and this guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help. I got in the car (I know, stupid as hell) and he ended up getting me a handful of pills. I didn\u2019t know what they were, but I downed all of them. I passed out and then when I woke up, we were hundreds of miles away from where we originally met and he proceeds to explain to me that I\u2019m \u201cgoing to be working for him now\u201d. He was a pimp. \n\nI spent the next few weeks in that situation - he took my cell phone, kept me drugged up, woke me up at 8am everyday to start working until the late hours of night. He\u2019d yell at me if I had any bruises from someone being too rough with me. \n\nI had tried to kill my self then, but it didn\u2019t work and woke up to him screaming at me about it.\n\nThe only way I was able to contact anyone was when I had developed an infection in my arm from IV drug use and he finally (after days of this) agreed to take me to the ER. I called my family from there and thankfully he agreed to just drop me off at the airport where they would pick me up.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about this many times in counseling, but it\u2019s always been like I was talking about the weather. No emotion behind it, just nonchalantly telling the story.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until very recently that I thought about the whole situation and realized that I had been kidnapped. That yes, I was looking for drugs and that was bad, but I was kidnapped and taken captive and used.\n\nSince this realization, I\u2019ve been having flashbacks, especially during sex. And having sex is a whole different can of worms for me - lots of times, my body doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything. It\u2019s like I\u2019m still in prostitution mode, where I act like I\u2019m enjoying it but really can\u2019t wait for it to be over. The only way I can get off is by imagining my partner having sex with other people - it\u2019s like I can\u2019t allow myself and my own body to experience pleasure. Imagining things like that make me feel like a creep and it takes\nsomething that\u2019s supposed to be intimate and skews it into this fucked up thing.\n\n\nLast night, I felt it came to a head. I was having sex with my boyfriend and just began having flashbacks of my time as a prostitute - seeing images of guys putting money on the table, disassociating from my body and I then felt this sensation of such anger that I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted to bit my boyfriend across the face, scratch him, grab his face hard. I feel so terrible about it. I started crying and then of course that ruined the moment and the poor guy had no idea what was going through my head.\n\nHe knows some of what I\u2019ve been through, but there\u2019s so much he doesn\u2019t know and doesn\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t blame him. \n\n\nI want to enjoy sex again. I\u2019m seeing a therapist and am on medication for bipolar, but this shit just haunts me. I can\u2019t tell if I actually enjoy sex or just default to prostitute mode where i make all the sounds and motions of enjoying something, like I\u2019m acting and playing the part. \n\nDoes anyone else have similar stories that they can offer advice about? I\u2019m in such a low spot. I\u2019ve been contemplating suicide for feeling like such a burden.\n\nTL, DR: past trauma affecting relationships - help?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 0, "end": 25, "span": "PTSD from forced sex work", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 365, "end": 378, "span": "sex for drugs", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 679, "end": 1431, "span": "pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help.

I have rarely spoken about it since it happened. I was disssauded from being public about it, and I now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. \n\nBecause being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. Now I'm realizing I want to be more open, but I thought the Internet is a good place to start. Part of my issue with sharing is that I can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although I logically know that of course people have. \n\nThis story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile:\n\nWell I began being groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17. I was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so I was the perfect target  At age 18 he started with the sexual advances and I was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. \n\nHe was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was I ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. His wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and I had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. \n\nAnd meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). \n\nIn the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.\n\nThere were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.\n\n While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. \n\nThis man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. I never got to complete my university degree because I was trapped under him when I should have been there. Also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now I have several quite severe chronic health conditions.\n\n I completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. Because I can't work, I can't afford proper health care or therapy. I have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and I don't think I'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. \n\nI don't live with a victim mentality but I think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me.\n\nThank you for reading my account because I need to get it out.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 38, "end": 50, "span": "exual abuse)", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 126, "end": 131, "span": "exual", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 200, "end": 245, "span": "sexual abuse I endured as a very young adult.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 855, "end": 899, "span": "groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17.

He grinded into me and I felt himself kinda push in trough my underwear and I felt scared. I went home and we broke up a few months later after he moved to Germany and I just set my relationship as with someone else to get him to leave me cause I kept trying but hed make me feel bad ( I was 18 and dumb...) \n\nI only told my twin but never my mom. She would NEVER understand.  I had another abusive bf this year (23 years old) and he was VERY misogynist. Like an incel. He hid it and it came out later on. He knew of my PTSD and all his rape jokes made me freak out and cry. He said the last time we fooled around he would cover my mouth and ignore me saying no and I freaked out idk why hed say that and I left a few weeks later. \n\nI now am seeing a new guy, but hes 100% diff than anyone. We were bffs. Hes sensitive, kind, funny, sweet, very dorky and very loving in his heart. He feels like the boy me. He is very sexually intelligent and patient. After my trauma at 18 I decided I want to wait till marriage so I never ever have to have sex with someone who I wouldn't regret. After my incel ex I feel it even more the way he changed and warped. My current bf knows this he knows everything and he is fine with it. His last ex they never had sex for their whole 5 years and he said he has dated many virgins and waited till they were ready. All his close friends say he truly is a great man. Hes a unicorn haha. \n\nI really want to fool around with him more but I am very scared Ill freak out. I cant masturbate without him and I feel like a WHORE doing it alone cause of my past. I just want to be normal. I want to just have happy sexual experiences with my bf. I know he can give me them the way he is but Im scared ill make them bad. I just want to be normal. Therapy is so slow and its such few and far between where I make milestones in anything at all!! How does this go away?! I manage my OCD, my anxiety is improving but PTSD never goes away. I hate it. I want to cry. I was only 18 why did me make me do all that stuff. I didnt want too. I feel like a disguting slut I want to punch my legs till they are black and blue. I hate myself for what I let happen to me and the fear it makes me have. My partner gets concerned to trigger me, hes very slow and patient when we discuss sex. Being a virgin I ask him questions and he never laughs at me like other people do he just explains stuff kindly and sweetly. No pressure no meanness. I feel like a dirty mean bad person. I want to talk to him but hes also stressed at work today and I feel so mean.

My LTR recently ended (~6 weeks ago) and I have been seeking treatment for what I thought was depression. I (f/26) had been very depressed throughout my LTR with my ex (m/26), but had never really gained much from the therapists that I had seen in the past. After the break up, I began to seek help, but this time was more vocal about the treatment I was receiving. The therapist I have been seeing post break up has been incredible, and I think my life is about to be on a major upswing. Today he identified that I have PTSD (verbal/physical abuse in childhood) and that there are ways to treat this. For once in my life I feel like there is hope.\n\nHas anyone else been treated for PTSD from childhood abuse?
