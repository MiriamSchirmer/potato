Not sure where I\u2019m going with this. I\u2019ve had my fair share of rough relationships, sure, who hasn\u2019t? But the last few years has been beyond bad. Like ending a 10 year relationship, losing a job I loved bc of my mental health, trying to move on with someone else and dealing with mental torture that led to a suicide attempt bad. I feel so stupid and pathetic even typing this. I mean people have been through so much worse. Yeah I was sexually abused as a child but that was forever ago and I was never physically abused in my relationships. But on top of depression, anxiety, and avoidant personality disorder, I\u2019ve also just been diagnosed with PTSD stemming from the last couple years.

He asked if he needed to get condoms but I said I didnt want to have sex. I was on my period too so I think its why he didnt do more to me. I always wanted to go to Sedona and Lowell Observatory and he took me there on our trip but he locked me in the hotel room, we never went to the observatory or even Lowell. He made me grind/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said \"but think about how id feel\" and pushed me down. He grinded into me and I felt himself kinda push in trough my underwear and I felt scared.
