Jump and land on the floor, bringing your hands down between your legs, and hold that position for a few seconds. Basically it should look like you're holding an axe chopping a piece of wood. Repeat this a few times until you feel your rage subside.\n\nTo lessen anxiety: Roll up in a ball. Put your head down by/between your knees (if you can), and wrap your arms around your legs. Squeeze yourself as hard as you can, try to tense all the muscles in your body that you can. Hold for as long as you can (like 5/10 seconds), then release. Repeat over and over until you feel some relief.\n\nI also posted this on a popular PTSD forum website (which I haven't used for years and HATE).

And ever since then I still don't know if I can call it sexual assault, sexual abuse, or just a bad experience. There are several reasons I don't know what to call it. I was young but so was he. He was four hears older but I know that he knew what he was doing. But at the same time he only would have been 10 or 11 at the time. I never said no, I never said stop, and when I told him he was heavy or that something hurt or was going too far he stopped. But yet again, I was only 6 or 7 and I just thought if felt good. I remember him telling me not to tell my mom or dad, and it happened more than once. I enjoyed it at the time though, It felt good. No intercourse actually happened, but there was a lot of grinding and touching. He had me watch him \"do his thing\" and asked if I would do it too and when I said no he didn't make me.\n\nThe thing is though, I still see this person all of the time and I will for the rest of my life probably. We have never talked about it, but I don't even know if he'd remember it. This person has always been violent and has a history of abusing my parents and me physically, along with \"anger management\" classes when he was about 10 or 13, I don't really remember. That's another thing. I don't really remember all that happened, it was over ten years ago. I remember some of it but not all of it.\n\nNow this is why I wish I had been raped. When I was in the fifth grade I started self harming. Not cutting, I hadn't even heard of that. Instead I would dig my nails into my skin and scratch until I bleed, this happened whenever I thought about what happened because I thought I did something wrong. After I told my friend (Who I'm still extremely close with to this day) about it I kind of just forgot about it every few months until when I started to hit puberty and feel sexual about anything. This was about seventh grade. I had just learned what rape was and then I remembered what happened to me and I wrote it down in my diary. The nexy day I blacked it all out with a marker.\n\nIn eighth grade I had a male teacher for homeroom who taught many of my classes. I would feel constant anxiety when he walked around the room because even the thought of him coming behind me scared me so much I was shaking. Now the weird part was he was my favorite teacher and at the time my favorite adult. So sometimes I would stay up from lunch and talk to him about anxiety and such. But at the same time, I was scared out of my mind that he was going to do something to me. Now keep in mind, this was the most innocent, sweetest teacher, nicest adult and teacher I knew at the time, and yes he was a history teacher, fulfilling the stereotype. But Even though I trusted him more than pretty much anyone at the time, I still was in a constant state of fear when he walked around the room. I thought putting myself in uncomfortable situations like seeing him during lunch would help me to trust him more and it actually did. Things got better, even though I never did tell him what had happened when I was little. in eighth grade a started to scratch myself more and a few of my friends noticed. It was on and off but by then end of the year I had stopped.\n\nWhen high school started I was a nervous wreck. I was starting a new school where I didn't know anybody. So obviously, little old me began to think that the first friend I made there would be my best friends, so I told a lot of people. By a lot I mean like 7 or 8. Some of them I still talk to, but a lot of them I told because they themselves had been assaulted. So early into freshman year I had my first kiss, which led to my first make out session. Of course I freak out because there's this heavy weight on top of me and I hadn't control anything. My heart started to race and I had a hard time breathing. I was having an anxiety attack. That's when I started cutting. All of freshman year I was cutting on and off. Nowhere anyone could see though. The next few months things got better and worse all the time. One week I'd be fine and the next I'd be scared to go home because the person that did that to me would be back there. About February I had my first boyfriend. I told him about it and whenever I would start freaking out when we were doing something he would be totoally okay with it and just make sure I was okay. Truly a great guy. We broke up after about 9 months. I didn't have a lot of trouble with him sexually but when I did it was bad. We never had sex though. To this day I am still a virgin.\n\nNow I'm a sophomore in high school and for the past few months as I've been pleasuring myself and such, I would start crying. It's not like any of the things I was doing to myself he had done to me, but I would constantly think of someone, him, another man, holding me against my will and raping me or forcing me to do things. What happened to me was not anywhere this close to extreme, and sometimes I feel like I just need to get over myself and deal with it because nothing really bad happened. But something did happen, and Sometimes I feel like it was my fault and I was in the wrong and I wasn't abused or anything and it was just kids being kids. But on the other hand I remember him knowing exactly what to do and how to make himself feel good.\n\nI know he took advantage of me. But cutting since fifth grade and being in a constant state of fear of my eighth grade history teacher doesn't add up from what he did. It's not like he forced me to do anything. I've read so many articles, I've contacted Planned Parenthood and RAINN chatrooms asking them if I'd even been abused. They all said that's up for me to decide. Maybe it wasn't the thing that happened to me though. Maybe it was the fact that he would hit my mom my dad and me and that put the fear into my head. I don't know what caused it but I feel like I'm overreacting but I just can't help the anxiety and the tears and the thought of some man inside of me whenever I touch myself. But it just doesn't add up.\n\nI do sometimes wish I was raped. It would make life clearer. It might cause more trauma but at least I would know it wasn't my fault. At least I would know it was assault or I would know it was abuse. at least I would have the courage to tell an adult and not have them judge me thinking that I was just some horny kid who messed around with a family member because I was such a horny child. I would know why I feel so exposed and preyed on. Because right now I have no idea why I feel this sort of... I don't even know if you can call it PTSD.\n\nI know people who have been raped will tell me to never wish this upon myself but I really do. It might make my life harder, but I won't have to question everything I do and think to myself that I'm an attention seeker even when I never told anybody some of this information. If you still feel as though you need to tell me I'm a terrible person, go right ahead. I already feel guilty about this feeling.", "displayed_text": "sometimes I wish I was raped Now before you start typing about how I shouldn't say that and I could never want something like that to happen to me, I want you to hear me out.\n\nWhen I was little. about 6 or 7ish, something happened to me. And ever since then I still don't know if I can call it sexual assault, sexual abuse, or just a bad experience. There are several reasons I don't know what to call it. I was young but so was he. He was four hears older but I know that he knew what he was doing. But at the same time he only would have been 10 or 11 at the time. I never said no, I never said stop, and when I told him he was heavy or that something hurt or was going too far he stopped. But yet again, I was only 6 or 7 and I just thought if felt good. I remember him telling me not to tell my mom or dad, and it happened more than once. I enjoyed it at the time though, It felt good. No intercourse actually happened, but there was a lot of grinding and touching. He had me watch him \"do his thing\" and asked if I would do it too and when I said no he didn't make me.\n\nThe thing is though, I still see this person all of the time and I will for the rest of my life probably. We have never talked about it, but I don't even know if he'd remember it. This person has always been violent and has a history of abusing my parents and me physically, along with \"anger management\" classes when he was about 10 or 13, I don't really remember. That's another thing. I don't really remember all that happened, it was over ten years ago. I remember some of it but not all of it.\n\nNow this is why I wish I had been raped. When I was in the fifth grade I started self harming. Not cutting, I hadn't even heard of that. Instead I would dig my nails into my skin and scratch until I bleed, this happened whenever I thought about what happened because I thought I did something wrong. After I told my friend (Who I'm still extremely close with to this day) about it I kind of just forgot about it every few months until when I started to hit puberty and feel sexual about anything. This was about seventh grade. I had just learned what rape was and then I remembered what happened to me and I wrote it down in my diary. The nexy day I blacked it all out with a marker.\n\nIn eighth grade I had a male teacher for homeroom who taught many of my classes. I would feel constant anxiety when he walked around the room because even the thought of him coming behind me scared me so much I was shaking. Now the weird part was he was my favorite teacher and at the time my favorite adult. So sometimes I would stay up from lunch and talk to him about anxiety and such. But at the same time, I was scared out of my mind that he was going to do something to me. Now keep in mind, this was the most innocent, sweetest teacher, nicest adult and teacher I knew at the time, and yes he was a history teacher, fulfilling the stereotype. But Even though I trusted him more than pretty much anyone at the time, I still was in a constant state of fear when he walked around the room. I thought putting myself in uncomfortable situations like seeing him during lunch would help me to trust him more and it actually did. Things got better, even though I never did tell him what had happened when I was little. in eighth grade a started to scratch myself more and a few of my friends noticed. It was on and off but by then end of the year I had stopped.\n\nWhen high school started I was a nervous wreck. I was starting a new school where I didn't know anybody. So obviously, little old me began to think that the first friend I made there would be my best friends, so I told a lot of people. By a lot I mean like 7 or 8. Some of them I still talk to, but a lot of them I told because they themselves had been assaulted. So early into freshman year I had my first kiss, which led to my first make out session. Of course I freak out because there's this heavy weight on top of me and I hadn't control anything. My heart started to race and I had a hard time breathing. I was having an anxiety attack. That's when I started cutting. All of freshman year I was cutting on and off. Nowhere anyone could see though. The next few months things got better and worse all the time. One week I'd be fine and the next I'd be scared to go home because the person that did that to me would be back there. About February I had my first boyfriend. I told him about it and whenever I would start freaking out when we were doing something he would be totoally okay with it and just make sure I was okay. Truly a great guy. We broke up after about 9 months. I didn't have a lot of trouble with him sexually but when I did it was bad. We never had sex though. To this day I am still a virgin.\n\nNow I'm a sophomore in high school and for the past few months as I've been pleasuring myself and such, I would start crying. It's not like any of the things I was doing to myself he had done to me, but I would constantly think of someone, him, another man, holding me against my will and raping me or forcing me to do things. What happened to me was not anywhere this close to extreme, and sometimes I feel like I just need to get over myself and deal with it because nothing really bad happened. But something did happen, and Sometimes I feel like it was my fault and I was in the wrong and I wasn't abused or anything and it was just kids being kids. But on the other hand I remember him knowing exactly what to do and how to make himself feel good.\n\nI know he took advantage of me. But cutting since fifth grade and being in a constant state of fear of my eighth grade history teacher doesn't add up from what he did. It's not like he forced me to do anything. I've read so many articles, I've contacted Planned Parenthood and RAINN chatrooms asking them if I'd even been abused. They all said that's up for me to decide. Maybe it wasn't the thing that happened to me though. Maybe it was the fact that he would hit my mom my dad and me and that put the fear into my head. I don't know what caused it but I feel like I'm overreacting but I just can't help the anxiety and the tears and the thought of some man inside of me whenever I touch myself. But it just doesn't add up.\n\nI do sometimes wish I was raped. It would make life clearer. It might cause more trauma but at least I would know it wasn't my fault. At least I would know it was assault or I would know it was abuse. at least I would have the courage to tell an adult and not have them judge me thinking that I was just some horny kid who messed around with a family member because I was such a horny child. I would know why I feel so exposed and preyed on. Because right now I have no idea why I feel this sort of... I don't even know if you can call it PTSD.\n\nI know people who have been raped will tell me to never wish this upon myself but I really do. It might make my life harder, but I won't have to question everything I do and think to myself that I'm an attention seeker even when I never told anybody some of this information. If you still feel as though you need to tell me I'm a terrible person, go right ahead. I already feel guilty about this feeling."}, "Traumatic-Event-Detection-end_fin.html": {"id": "Traumatic-Event-Detection-end_fin.html", "text": "End of survey", "displayed_text": "End of survey"}}
