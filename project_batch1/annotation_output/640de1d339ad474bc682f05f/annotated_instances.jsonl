I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask but she's happily moved out of the bad situation and is struggling to compute that her new nice house with some good friends is permanent. Does anyone know anything that I can help her with? She's about as sweet as you can get and the look of sheer terror when she had a flashback made me want to cry.

{"id": "243_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Realistic nightmares that don\u2019t end on waking. For the past 4 years, I have been dealing with sleep disturbances related to my PTSD. The one I had tonight has me desperate for help or advice, maybe even just a comment or two from someone who has dealt with similar issues.  \n\n*edit: not being able to sleep has resulted in a lot of googling. Perhaps instead of a nightmare, this is a \u201c\nHypnagogic Hallucination\u201d \n\n\nAbout once a week I am woken up by a \u201cnightmare\u201d (calling it this for lack of a better term.) The nightmare is always brief and is set exactly in my setting (my room, the hotel I\u2019m staying in, etc.) It\u2019s hard to call it a night mare because it occurs as I\u2019m waking from sleep, but in the moment it feels as though I\u2019m waking because of the thing happening in the nightmare. \n\nFor example, tonight I woke with a start and saw a man peeking his head into my bedroom. My door was ajar and I clearly saw a mans face, leaning over and peering into my room. I yelled out (actually yelled, I was awake at this point) \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d Or \u201cwho are you?\u201d I\u2019m not sure. But I grabbed my phone, dialed 911 and jumped out of bed and turned on the light. It was as I was jumping out of bed I recognized this might be another situation where I was having a nightmare, so I didn\u2019t call 911. But 80% of my brain was still full on functioning as if there was an intruder in my home. I literally went as far as to grab a knife and check every inch of my home. I stood in my entry way with the knife and phone in my hand for a good 10 minutes trying to reason with myself that it wasn\u2019t real. It\u2019s hard to describe how my brain felt so torn. One part of me was constantly aware that it wasn\u2019t real, but there was and is this part of me that can\u2019t shake how real it felt. \n\nEven now, I am in bed with every light on and I can\u2019t sleep. Logically, nobody is here. But I am terrified and the adrenaline and fight-or-flight dump I just got has me completely freaked out. I\u2019m convinced if I turn off the lights and relax, it will happen again or I was wrong and it was real and I\u2019m about to get murdered. \n\nI have never had the effect of one of these episodes last this long. Normally they are more vague. I wake to the \u201cknowledge\u201d that someone is there, but I\u2019ve never actually had a full on hallucination. \n\nHas anyone experienced this? Maybe I need to finally seek professional help.

Raise your arms as high as you can above your head, and put your hands together (like people do when they're praying). Stretch as high as you can. Jump and land on the floor, bringing your hands down between your legs, and hold that position for a few seconds. Basically it should look like you're holding an axe chopping a piece of wood. Repeat this a few times until you feel your rage subside.\n\nTo lessen anxiety: Roll up in a ball. Put your head down by/between your knees (if you can), and wrap your arms around your legs. Squeeze yourself as hard as you can, try to tense all the muscles in your body that you can. Hold for as long as you can (like 5/10 seconds), then release.
