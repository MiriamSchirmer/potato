Therapist said there\u2019s a high chance I will end up dead by my own hand. I (26f) don\u2019t want to go into a lot of detail because I\u2019m still processing everything. I had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. Last Wednesday I drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. They took me to the nearest hospital where I actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me.

My therapist (who I switched to about 6 months ago as my last therapist was useless) told me very bluntly that if I don\u2019t get my shit together that I will die by my own hand before I die of old age. She said people like me often don\u2019t make it. She also said my parents expect that I will die from suicide. It shook me to my core. It was my first attempt in over 4 years and it was different than the others. This attempt terrified me. I don\u2019t remember much of it.
