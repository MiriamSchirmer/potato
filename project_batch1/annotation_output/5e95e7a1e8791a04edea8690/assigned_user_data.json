There exists only four years of my 30 year life not touched by trauma. \n\nA list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.\n\nExtreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.\n\n\nFainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I\u2019m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children\u2019s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)\n\n\nInsomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn\u2019t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. \n\n\nVivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it\u2019s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. \n\n\nSocial Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn\u2019t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)\n\n\nDepression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I\u2019m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn\u2019t make me sad or upset, it\u2019s not like I wanted those things because I don\u2019t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn\u2019t close to my dad but wasn\u2019t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn\u2019t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn\u2019t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)\n\n\nIrregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I\u2019m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)\n\n\nConcentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) \n\n\nA few other things I experienced but I don\u2019t feel like going into:\nEating disorders\nAlcohol and drug abuse \nPromiscuity \n\n\nAll of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I\u2019m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. \n\n\nJust now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns.", "displayed_text": "Everything but PTSD Up until my diagnosis this year, I had no idea why I was the way I was.

Normal jokes with awcual undertones, pretty normal stuff. But what I didn't know was that he has a traumatic past that made such jokes incredibly uncomfortable to him and he never told me I was crossing his boundaries so I did not see it coming a mile away, especially since he and I had been together and had fun shortly before then. \n\nI cried for several hours, just looking at my computer at nothing, crying and wiping my face.
