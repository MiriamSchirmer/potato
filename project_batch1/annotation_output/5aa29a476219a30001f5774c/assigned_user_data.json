My brother's abusive girlfriend lived with us. It seemed like it was just me, him, her and whatever person was staying in our basement at the time. They used to beat the crap out of each other. He was abusive emotionally and verbally and I remember mostly just hiding under a desk when I got home and just zoning out or not going home. I was a pretty square kid because I didn't want to be like my brother and got bullied a lot for that and I guess my \"dyke\" vibes or whatever (kids threw rocks at me at school-- kinda biblical).   \n\n\nI put all of these feelings aside for the longest time.

Hello,  \n\nI\u2019m a 25 year old woman that turns 26 in exactly two weeks, and I couldn\u2019t fathom being anymore depressed than I am now. When I was 14 and a new sophomore in high school , I met this 22 year old man (I\u2019ll call him The Man) via my friend who was 14 as well. At the time I didn\u2019t know how old he was and he and my friend\u2019s sister (16) were dating. Somehow, the man got my phone number and consistently and persistently texted me until I stopped ignoring him and began texting back. \n\nI didn\u2019t like him at first, but after weeks of texting nonstop, my 14 year old self somehow fell for him. I knew he was involved with my friend\u2019s sister, and it ate me alive, but I also had feelings for him. One day, when my mom wasn\u2019t home, I invited him over for the first time. We met at my neighborhood pool, and we sat in his car and talked in person for about an hour. When it was time for me to leave, he wrestled with me for about 10 mins trying to kiss me, and when I finally submitted, the only thing I could say was that his breath smelled. He left, and we continued to text. \n\nA week later, my friend\u2019s sister (who was in my orchestra class) gave me a note basically cursing me out for \u201ckissing her man\u201d and calling me a fat slut, which hurt because although I\u2019m no where near obese, I\u2019ve always struggled with my weight, and she knew that. I crumpled the paper up and threw it at her telling her that he has been persistently pursuing me. It was a big thing and I almost got kicked out of class. I was really hurt, but I knew I was wrong. I texted him and asked him why he told her, and he said he didn\u2019t want to keep a secret from her, and that he couldn\u2019t see me anymore. I was extremely hurt and didn\u2019t really understand what had happened. He began to ignore me, but would sometimes call me and leave messages about how sorry he was. This all took place around this time this year, the fall. \n\nI fell into a depression, being that this was my first romantic encounter, and it was so negatively toxic, I didn\u2019t know what to think or do. I stopped eating and lost a bunch of weight. Being that I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about this, my family thought I had developed an eating disorder. This lasted a couple months. Then in December, around Christmas break, I started getting prank phone calls. They would call about twice a day, and after about a week, the person came clean and turns out it was The Man.  He told me that he and my friend\u2019s sister ended things because her mom found out about their relationship. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. Elated, I told him I loved him too and agreed to being in a relationship with him. \n\nWhen school started back in January, he would come over after school every Wednesday. My single mom worked a lot, and I took advantage of that. We happily \u201cdated\u201d for exactly a month, until one day, he told me that my friend\u2019s sister wanted him back and wanted to work on their relationship. He also told me that while they were dating, they were sexually involved, something that he was not getting from me. He began breaking up with me saying that she was first. I was distraught. I thought that giving him what she could give him, would make him stay with me. While crying, I told him I would have sex with him. He decided to take me up on that offer. I told him I was scared and asked him if it would hurt and he said it would. He laid me down, and told me to open my legs. I was crying and scared, so he forced them open. I don\u2019t remember it actually happening, but I do remember after it happened, he told me to tell him that he broke me. I told him that he broke me, and he left, not changing his mind about ending things. I cried all night. \n\nHe continued to text me, and see me even while dating the sister. We would have sex, and my attachment to him became really deep, scary deep. About 2 months later, I snuck out in the middle of the night to meet him in my neighborhood and I got caught by the police. The police also found him, but let him go. They brought me home and told my mom. She was livid. She told me that she was pressing charges. She called me a slut and a whore and took my phone. I found a way to contact him and told him what was going on. My mom contacted him and wanted to meet up with him. I don\u2019t know what that meeting looked like or how it went but they met, and afterwards, he told me he couldn\u2019t talk to me anymore, and my mom didn\u2019t press charges. \n\nAbout a year later, I received an email from him saying he missed me. Our secret relationship started up again, but this time it was a bit different. His twin brother was dating this 17 year old girl that I went to school with, so naturally, the girl and I became friends to be each other\u2019s cover. We would all hangout together and one time we all were in the same bed and having sex, but not with each other. I met some of his other siblings and had to lie about my age when they said I looked so young. He would also give me alcohol. There was a time that I went on a weekend trip with him and his brother to visit their friend (24). We stayed at the Friend\u2019s house who was celebrating his girlfriend of 6 years\u2019 birthday. It was a big celebration because she was finally turning 18. The Man had friends like him and even his twin brother was like him. About a week later, I found out that he gave me chlamydia and when I told him about it, and that he was the only guy I\u2019ve ever been with, he denied it and said that I must\u2019ve gotten it from a toilet seat or something. Somehow, my entire high school found out that I had an std. I don\u2019t know how, but I continued to date him. On the same date that he broke up with me the year before, he broke up with me again, stating that I was too young. He still continued to see me and have sex with me, just without the title of being in a relationship with me. This allowed him to see other people, which I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later, my mom found out and this time actually pressed charges. She took me to talk to a detective and I remember hating her for that. I didn\u2019t tell the detective everything but I told him some things and that I loved him. The Man decided to turn himself in and I didn\u2019t talk to him again after that. My mom was extremely mad at me for months. I knew she was disappointed in me, and every chance she got, she let me know. \n\nWhen I started my senior year of high school, things were a lot more normal. My mom was trusting me again, and even got me a car. I had a boyfriend that was my age, that she approved of. One day, at a Friday high school football game, I saw The Man. I was there with my boyfriend and avoided The Man. He stared at me and watched me. When the game ended, he texted me and said that he sees I moved on. I said yeah. \n\nThe case against him was still going on. A few months passed and he contacted me begging me to ask my mom to drop the charges because he was facing 20 years. I told him that I would talk to her. He then asked me to marry him and said that if I marry him, the charges would automatically drop and that he could get us an apartment. He said we could start a family and that he would take care of us. I seriously thought about it, and then declined. I told my mom that he contacted me and she was mad at me. A few months later, I found out that she worked out a deal to bring his sentencing down to him being on probation for 10 years and being on the sex offender\u2019s list for 3 years. \n\nAt the time, my teenage self moved on from the situation very quickly. However when I turned 25 last year, all the memories and emotions I suppressed hit me like a ton of bricks. Ever since I was 16, my body has been sick. I have acne all over my body, irregular periods, mood swings, regular yeast infections and vaginal infections and have had terribly toxic relationships with men. I think that every guy I encounter has given me an STD. For the last two years, and being sexually active once out of those two years, I have been trying to convince myself that I do not have HIV even after testing negatively several times. I\u2019m starting to believe I\u2019m traumatized. \n\n I always feel like I have to please any male I encounter, and that I need to work hard and give him everything I have to avoid him leaving me. I\u2019m overtly sexual and think that I must be a pornstar in order to receive love from the male kind however, I don\u2019t really know what intimacy is. \n\nI don\u2019t have healthy relationships at all. If I befriend a female, after a couple months, I cut her off and stop talking to her. \n\nI have dreams of being a doctor, but now think that I\u2019m incapable of achieving something like that. My confidence is shot, and I hate myself. \n\nI feel guilty for The Man having to spend nearly all of his 20s on probation. I hate myself for being such a fast and loose little girl. I hate what I did to my mom and my sister. \n\nI still live at home, in the same bedroom where all of this took place and it\u2019s starting to swallow me whole. I\u2019ve been having flashbacks of what happened and I hate myself for that.\n\n I don\u2019t know who I am anymore and I\u2019m scared to interact with people or even exist on this planet. Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I\u2019m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don\u2019t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. \n\nIm in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I\u2019ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I\u2019ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can\u2019t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I\u2019ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I\u2019m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I\u2019m always alone and always will be. I\u2019m scared and I don\u2019t know what to do.", "displayed_text": "What is wrong with me? Do I have PTSD?

Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I\u2019m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don\u2019t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. \n\nIm in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I\u2019ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I\u2019ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can\u2019t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I\u2019ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I\u2019m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I\u2019m always alone and always will be.

I will definitely need to keep a LOT of healthy snacks available, because I can already feel intense munchies in the making lol. Is anyone else taking it and do you have any advice?

Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. \n\nHey Everyone,   \nFirst time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   \n\n\n1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. \n2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. \n3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him \"If you're gonna hit me, do it!\" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said \"Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her\". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me \"oh I fight with my brothers too!\" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. \n4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. \n5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that \"if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault\".   \n\n\nIn my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole \"PTSD\" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   \nIdk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life).

Not one drink (this was not easy at all)\n\nBut I'm struggling now more then I ever have, My PTSD seems worst then I remember it being before I started drinking to manage it. \n\nI'm angry, paranoid, anxious, depressed, and hypervigilant to the point of near exhaustion. I just feel like giving up and going back to drinking. I feel like these feelings will never go away and I can't function like this, I either need relief by using alcohol again or I need to see a doctor. \n\nThe problem is I'm very paranoid of people and their intentions and I do not trust doctors at all, I also am apprehensive about telling them everything (or anything for that matter) because I feel like they won't keep things between us. I can't repeat the things that cause me hurt and pain to myself, Let alone another person who does not understand what I've been though and had to do. \n\nDeep down I do want to get all those things off my chest but I'm afraid to talk about them. I also don't like being stigmatized as crazy or weak because I am a man. I was raised in a very conservative household and I was taught not to cry, show weakness, or talk about trivial things like how I'm feeling or how things make me feel so talking about feelings is very alien to me. I just don't know if I can tell someone I don't know or trust everything.\n\nI've considered just going to a psychiatrist instead of a therapist so I don't have to talk about anything. \n\nI just want relief from these feelings. \n\nIf anyone has combat induced PTSD, Can you give me advice on what medications to ask for?\n\nAny advice would be great.\n\nThank you", "displayed_text": "Advice on medications and therapy I have been struggling for PTSD for 6 years.
