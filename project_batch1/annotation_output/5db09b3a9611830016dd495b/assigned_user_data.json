First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to \"listen to her point of view because she had listened to me.\" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our \"conversation.\" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.\n\nAt some point in this \"conversation\" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say \"No\" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said \"nice talking to you guys.\" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.\n\nIn the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way \"there\".  \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways.

In fact I only registered to make this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't think a lot about PTSD until a year or two ago when I just sorta got hit full force with something I didn't understand. As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything.

I mean these nightmares were so insane I actually thought I might be possessed by a demon and considered seeking help from a priest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would get this anxiety that got so bad that I could not turn my back to someone or all this other weird shit. I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from. It was like I was being poisoned surreptitiously or something. I thought I was a tough guy but this was like physiological in nature. It made me so sick sometimes that I'd puke for days and not be able to sleep and I'd get dehydrated and have to go to the ER and get saline and a MRI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I went to some therapist because I thought I had an anxiety disorder or something, but they were like no you got PTSD. I didn't believe it at the time, I was like \"yeah right\", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood/brain/skull/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some \"creative\" interrogation or whatever) they never recover. This is a concept I'm only becoming aware of now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main problem is with triggers. In fact, it got so bad that I had to quit my job six months ago and I've been out of work since then and barely left my house in all that time in order to avoid triggers/stimuli. Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say \"hands kill\" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people. If I trust someone enough to tell them what I've just posted here they see me as broken and crazy and want nothing to do with me. So it's kind of a lose-lose situation and I've been on my own with this for about 13 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't stay in my house forever and never go outside again so what can I do to bring myself back into the fold when I hit one of those triggers? Even when I'm doped up on tranquilizers it doesn't always fully stop the rush of memories and sensations that come flooding into my soul. I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to my little monologue.

You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some \"creative\" interrogation or whatever) they never recover. This is a concept I'm only becoming aware of now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main problem is with triggers. In fact, it got so bad that I had to quit my job six months ago and I've been out of work since then and barely left my house in all that time in order to avoid triggers/stimuli. Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say \"hands kill\" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people. If I trust someone enough to tell them what I've just posted here they see me as broken and crazy and want nothing to do with me. So it's kind of a lose-lose situation and I've been on my own with this for about 13 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't stay in my house forever and never go outside again so what can I do to bring myself back into the fold when I hit one of those triggers? Even when I'm doped up on tranquilizers it doesn't always fully stop the rush of memories and sensations that come flooding into my soul. I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to my little monologue.

My supervisors are very understanding and kind, thats why I was able to keep up the work most parts of the months. \n\nBut now Im really struggling with the last straws. I have a paper due and it is stressing me out. Usually I called in sick once every two weeks or worked from home once a week because getting out of my house in the morning gave me anxiety. I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up. Maybe I just need someone to tell me you know its okay to call in sick, you dont have to feel guilty your working on yourself and thats whats most important. I self lack this view because I mostly dont consider myself helpworhty, which is another problem on its own. \n\nI already contacted my mentor from school yesterday. The last time we spoke she told me I could figure it out with the internship company if I knew what would work for me. Problem is, I dont know what works for me. Each day is different. Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go. So I feel like it would give me some rest if I gave myself time to work on this paper or going to the internship part time. That way everyone knows what to expect from me instead of just seeing if I will be able to show up everyday. \n\nOn the other hand, over the holidays when I had some time off I felt awful. I really dont like being on my own all day and had a lot anxiety that I had to show up for work the next week. So being at home all the time didnt work out that well. \nI never called in sick for a longer than a day in the past because the pressure to show up and fear of losing my job or getting kicked out of school. But thats what is getting back to me now cause I dont have a healthy view on how to get better.\n\n\n\n\nAs you see Im constantly questioning myself, I just dont know what would be appropriate for someone in my situation. How do you guys handle this stuff? What do you do to get productive and how do you handle the stress of a deadline when there is so much going on in your head? Have you taken a longer time of work to deal with your mental health and how did that work out?\n\nThank you so much for reading this, I am very new to all this and its a bit of a thing for me to ask advice cause it means admitting I need help.

I have a paper due and it is stressing me out. Usually I called in sick once every two weeks or worked from home once a week because getting out of my house in the morning gave me anxiety. I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up. Maybe I just need someone to tell me you know its okay to call in sick, you dont have to feel guilty your working on yourself and thats whats most important. I self lack this view because I mostly dont consider myself helpworhty, which is another problem on its own. \n\nI already contacted my mentor from school yesterday. The last time we spoke she told me I could figure it out with the internship company if I knew what would work for me. Problem is, I dont know what works for me. Each day is different. Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go. So I feel like it would give me some rest if I gave myself time to work on this paper or going to the internship part time. That way everyone knows what to expect from me instead of just seeing if I will be able to show up everyday. \n\nOn the other hand, over the holidays when I had some time off I felt awful. I really dont like being on my own all day and had a lot anxiety that I had to show up for work the next week. So being at home all the time didnt work out that well. \nI never called in sick for a longer than a day in the past because the pressure to show up and fear of losing my job or getting kicked out of school. But thats what is getting back to me now cause I dont have a healthy view on how to get better.\n\n\n\n\nAs you see Im constantly questioning myself, I just dont know what would be appropriate for someone in my situation. How do you guys handle this stuff? What do you do to get productive and how do you handle the stress of a deadline when there is so much going on in your head? Have you taken a longer time of work to deal with your mental health and how did that work out?\n\nThank you so much for reading this, I am very new to all this and its a bit of a thing for me to ask advice cause it means admitting I need help. Which would be okay for someone else, I just feel ashamed about the whole situation, its not a walk in the park you know..\n\nTLDR: Gonna start PTSD (EMDR) therapy and dont know if or how I can finish my internship. Need some advice on how others deal with the aspect of jobs and expectations.\n\n\n"}, "1857_ptsd": {"id": "1857_ptsd", "text": "PTSD from Martial Arts I'm not sure if I'm looking for suggestions, or for people who share my experience, or just sympathy or to vent but.\n\nWithout really going into it, TL;DR martial arts training was a large part of a system of abuse I suffered and is a very large trigger for me.
