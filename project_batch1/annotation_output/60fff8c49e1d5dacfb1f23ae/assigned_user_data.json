Now that my mom is out of prison, she's trying to control every aspect of my life.", "displayed_text": "I'm a teenager, and throughout my entire life, I've never really had good parents, or parents at all for that matter.  I'm not exaggerating.  I was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when I was in middle school.  His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom\u2019s house, and I was so awe-stricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time.  Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs.  My mom went to prison for that and lost her caf\u00e9.  We live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and I was bullied because of who my parents were.  My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison. \n   My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person\u2019s house.  My parents did not get along at this point.  We were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out.  He got out of the car, went to the driver\u2019s side, and punched my mom in the face.  I got out and told him not to hit my mom.  At that point, I was really scared and mad that he did that, so I ran towards him to stop him.  He literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road.  I couldn't even walk.  My mom tried to help me, but he started choking her.  I hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance.  He was so badly strung out on drugs.  He went to prison again and seems to be doing well.  I met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but he's so hard to handle.  I think a lot of it is that I can't bring myself to forgive him.  My mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, I moved in with my dad\u2019s mom (the one who lived just down the road) because I trust her, her house is stable, and she's more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents.  I also stay at my boyfriend\u2019s a lot.  Now that my mom is out of prison, she's trying to control every aspect of my life."}, "534_counseling": {"id": "534_counseling", "text": "I've been having horrible anxiety for the last week.

This left me feeling betrayed and with no confidence in myself because of her lack of explanation.

I was stressed beyond anything I had ever experienced at the time. I was juggling classes that were very hard, mentally preparing myself to move across the country for medical school, and bringing myself to be able to break up with the girl I was dating because I knew I didn\u2019t want her following me. I was cramming for a practical the next day and I noticed my groin was numb, and I looked it up and that\u2019s a sign of heart problems (which I was paranoid of because I have palpitations). My heart was already pounding from lots of coffee consumption and stress, so I called my mom (a nurse) to tell her and ask her if I should be worried, but when I was on the phone with her I had what I would describe as an extremely severe panic attack, which was also my first panic attack, so I had no idea what was going on. I was crying and saying bye to my mom as my heart felt like it was leaping out of my chest and I was making peace with the fact that I was goin going to die (in my head at least). I remember thinking that I was scared to die and leave my family, and I was praying that they be taken care of when I was gone. \n\nI went to the ER, they said it was a panic attack and I shouldn\u2019t be worried. I tried not to be worried, but I was left with a baseline anxiety level that made life extremely difficult. I would question myself and wonder why I couldn\u2019t just learn my lesson and move on, but as the months pass by I am only becoming more dissociated and feel as if I\u2019m watching my life in third person. Anything related to my panic attack (seeing the girl I was going to leave, applying for jobs or school, talking about what I want to do with my life) brings a sense of panic where I can\u2019t articulate my words. Negative thoughts related to these things constantly possess my mind, to the point where suicidal thoughts enter my mind because the pain of not being able to simply relax and enjoy my day as I used to be able to, or put myself out there to get a job or go back to school is maddening.\n\nIf anyone could elaborate on my experience and let me know if it\u2019s relatable or sounds like PTSD I\u2019d be really happy to talk with you about it.
