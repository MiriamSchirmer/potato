My mom was mentally ill and beat me and my siblings on a daily basis and my dad beat my mom often in front of us children. My mom yelled at me for everything: If I laughed to much, If I cried, if I was angry so basically when I showed any emotion at all. If I did well in school (A:s were the only acceptable grade) helped her by being her emotional support as soon as I came home from school aka listening to her problems etc she would not beat me. But as soon as I did the slightest wrong she beat me and told me that she wished that she had just done an abortion etc \n\nI remember that my mom used to beat me when I was 4-7 years old just because I was so ugly. She pulled my hair and slammed me into a wall and she beat me and cried at the same time and yelled that I was a disappointment in every way. She forced me to have my hair up in a high ponytail or else she would beat me and pull my hair. I am born with a large forehead but the high ponytails only made it worse (I never wear my hair up now bc is how large of a forehead I have) I was also bullied because of that and because everyone knew that they beat me at home so in school they knew that I was an easy target, I remember just laying in my own piss one time because I was so scared after being beaten in school and scared of going home knowing that my mom would beat me because I pissed my pants. \n\nIn conclusion my childhood sucked and that has caused a lot of problems now that I am a young adult F21, especially in my relationship. Me and my BF M21  has been in a relationship for 2,5 years and he is wonderful.

I also don\u2019t want to control him or let my anxiety make him shitty because it is not his fault, he has never given me any reason to even be worried but still I feel like shit. I feel sad sometimes and jealous when he hangs out with friends but I never tell him that he should not hang out whit them and he hangs out with them despite me having panic attacks and feeling as if I suck and that he will find someone better etc etc etc \n\nI am 100% aware that my feelings are not valid, I am loved but I just can not feel it and believe it. I go to trauma focused therapy (PTSD) so I am working on it and by BF knows about it and we always talk about it.
