Then I gave him a death stare and he called me a bitch. \n\nI've been raped by one of these city, drug dealer type guys. I live in this city alone. In my hometown these types of bad people would stalk me and pick on me for some reason. I'm a walking target. I dont feel safe leaving my house to go to the corner store. I'm scared to go on the subway to go ANYWHERE now. I dont have money to uber everywhere. It's so hard cause this could be real danger. It's so triggering and idk what to do.

As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything. That worked okay for a few years, although I was really struggling mentally during that time, but then the wheels just came off at some point where I was too messed up in the brain to operate normally in society.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would get these nightmares that were so bad that they wanted to use me as an experiment for a new drug that's being trialed for use by the U.S. Military. I forget what it's called but essentially it's this blood pressure medication, but when you take it you never dream again for the rest of your life.

I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from.

I didn't believe it at the time, I was like \"yeah right\", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood/brain/skull/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over.

Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say \"hands kill\" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it.

I\u2019ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don\u2019t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn\u2019t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn\u2019t be enough and he\u2019d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nOn top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I\u2019m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I\u2019m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we\u2019re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they\u2019d be better off because now I\u2019m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control.

I lost the apartment I was living in due to not paying rent and I ended up with a friend of his that lived in the complex and was also a tweaker and much older than me. This is where it got very bad, he was very sadistic and verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. He told me he was intentionally trying to make me go crazy, and he would just stand there and smile and taunt me when he got me to the point of crying. He talked about ways to kill me, and weird things like splitting my mind and making me reborn and being one of the \"elite\" by being tortured. Just really insane and confusing and he kept me in a constant state of anxiety to the point where I would have panic attacks when he wasn't home, especially after I found him hiding in the pantry when I thought he had left... he was physically abusive as well but it went deeper than the \"normal\" abuse because he would have a totally different voice, different face everything when he would talk about that weird stuff it literally scared me to my core because it was like being talked to by a demon... and he made me feel so dehumanized and worthless, he told me there were all these things wrong with me and I developed a fear of going outside which lead to me being trapped in the apartment with him for 7 months. I believe he drugged me as well as revenge for having him put in jail but that is a whole other long and horrible story. All of this happened in a short period of time. \n\nMy memory is really messed up when it comes to all of that. I don't know exactly when it began, and there are huge chunks of time missing. I actually had a point where I just \"woke up\" but I was sitting in my bed, I didn't remember ANYTHING for several minutes and even as things came back to me, I had this horrible weird feeling like my name and my room were not mine. I didn't know what I was doing before that and my bed and the furniture were moved and I still don't remember moving anything. I have never understood that but when this happened I returned to the abusive guy (I was all alone, as an addict he was the ONLY person who still talked to me and at that point I was convinced that I was crazy and none of the things he did happened) and he acted all emotional and told me some weird stuff about how it finally happened and that \"Caeley #1\" has died and I was now \"Caeley #2\". It made me feel more alone and terrified and I now wonder about the possibility of having DID (I had traumatic things happen as a child) or if it's part of PTSD and depersonalization/derealization disorder I've been diagnosed with. \n\nAnother thing I wonder about is why I am so emotionally detached from my memories. I remember it like it happened to someone else and I was watching, not like it happened to me. It makes me wonder if I even have PTSD at all. I only hear about people with PTSD being fearful and crying and everything but I am not like that, yet it still affects me and my life in other ways. Until recently (I think having a baby has changed it) I was unable to cry. I talk about it constantly, I think about it constantly, but it's the same memories over and over and I feel nothing when I think about them, just disturbed by the lack of feeling. I feel like not feeling anything makes it even harder to move past it... it's like I'm stuck. Like I blocked out the emotions then when they got too horrible to deal with and then I just stayed like that. I cry about other things, I feel love and everything but I'm totally detached from the memories. I factually know how I felt then. I know I was in absolute despair and so much pain but like someone else TOLD me how they felt. \n\nWhen I talk about this stuff, I do not feel any anxiety at all, but my back tightens up and I begin shaking and getting cold, every time. When I'm talking about it out loud, if I go on too long the tightness in my back spreads through my body and makes it hard for me to breathe and I have to stop talking. Once I stop talking about it, it goes away. It has made it difficult for me to explain everything to a therapist. It's very weird and I'm serious when I say I do not feel the anxiety whatsoever when I talk about it... it's just my body reacting that way. When I was typing what happened, I got those physical symptoms and when I started typing this, it faded away. Is it still PTSD if I am emotionally detached from the memories? Is there a type of therapist or someone that can help me connect to those memories and move past it? I was seeing a counselor in my home town but I got married and moved, and she wasn't helping any way because she didn't understand what I meant when I told her about the detachment.
