{"id": "2233_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I think my abuser did more to me than I realize TW: Childhood sexual assault/rape When I was young, before preschool/kindergarten, I was babysat by a mormon woman. She had two children, a daughter my age and a son who was in middle/high school. The daughter was my best friend at the time and the son was mentally challenged. He would lure me into his room by playing the \"Barbie Girl\" song by Aqua, I loved Barbies. The mother would always make him take me to the bathroom, even though I knew where it was. He would touch me and force me to touch him. I still remember how cramped the space was and how he would stand in the stall with me while I went to the bathroom. I still remember how hot his penis always was. The babysitting stopped when I came home one day and told my mom that he had shoved his tongue in my mouth/down my throat. But neither of my parents knew the extent of the abuse until I was in middle school, half a state away.\n\nRecently, I've come to the age where I should be getting a regular physical. The thought of opening my legs to anyone, let alone my female doctor, horrifies me to an extent I've never been frightened before. Even before she could explain anything, I was in tears and shaking uncontrollably. The speculum looks like a weapon to me. Even the thought of being in a hospital gown scares me. She says that I don't need to have one, but I want to have children and getting a physical is the first step to understanding my full health spectrum. I'm in therapy because I couldn't go through with the physical, and I still haven't been able to do it one year later. She won't put me out for it and only offers me ibuprofen and xanax.\n\nLast night, even just thinking about the physical had me shaking and in tears. I curled up in a ball and closed my legs as tight as I could. Even now, typing this, I have my legs crossed tight. I think the son of my babysitter must have done more to me than just touching. I don't know how to cope with this. I'm still a virgin and have never had a real boyfriend. The last guy that tried to have sex with me was very insistent and I wasn't ready. He was disappointed and stopped talking to me when I pushed him away and accused him of only wanting me for sex. I want to have kids and I want to have sex, but I want to have them with someone I trust and love and who loves and trusts me back. I also have a horrible gag reflex and fear of blowjobs. I know that talking to my therapist is the best way to work through all of this but I have other issues that have taken precedence at the moment. I guess I just wanted to have the idea somewhere and vent a little.

At first, I thought of the crash itself, then I thought about other crashes, then I thought about scenarios not even related to cars (examples would be: what if I randomly lost the ability to use my legs and fell and busted my teeth out? Or What if the entire world collapses?). I get very nervous when others drive, I can\u2019t help but think of how close we are to the other cars and how fast we are coming up to a red light.
