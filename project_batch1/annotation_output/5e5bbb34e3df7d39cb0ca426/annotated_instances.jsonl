I\u2019ve left the room before and gone to watch TV in the bedroom when he and my daughter were watching a scary movie and there was no issue. I\u2019ve told him many times that movies can be triggering for me. Last night, a movie came on where a woman was getting ready for a bed and a man in a mask was lurking outside. The music got ominous and I knew I had to get out of there FAST. I quickly went to the other room and turned the TV on to drown it out. I could feel my heart racing and my breath quickening just imagining what was happening on that TV in the other room. If he wanted to watch that movie, I was ok with it, I just couldn\u2019t be in that room.

I told him that I left the room quickly because I knew something was coming and didn\u2019t want to see/hear it since it was close to bed time. I said it had nothing to do with him and I wasn\u2019t angry or anything. He continued to try to have a conversation about communication with me in that moment. I resented it.

My mental health has also been really good recently and I haven't needed to use any of the following safety nets for a few weeks. But that doesn't stop me from stressing out.\n\nI live in the UK. My parents are a major support system for me but they live in Spain. In the past when I've been really unwell they've gotten the first flight out and been at my side within 24 hours. Obviously right now if I was to become unwell there's absolutely nothing they can do. \n\nWhen I get paranoid or hallucinate I tend to go to the drs, not to see the doc but the receptionists will let me sit in a room with some water and help me calm and ground myself. All our drs surgeries are closed unless a doctor has specifically asked you to come in. When I get unwell I am a danger to myself and others, so losing this safe space is very scary.\n\nAll my mental health appointments have been cancelled. I was due to have a CPA (annual review with all the people involved in my care) next Monday and I see my care coordinator every two weeks. None of this is happening.\n\nI understand why all these measures are in place and I know how important they are but I'm just feeling very alone and overwhelmed right now. It doesn't help that my husband suffers from major recurrent depressive disorder and is having an episode at the moment. So neither of us are in a fit state to help each other! \n\nSorry for the vent, just needed to get this off my chest!", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1333, "end": 1382, "span": "just feeling very alone and overwhelmed right now", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 10s "}}

(X-post from /r/rapecounseling) I was raped repeatedly by a family member over the course of about 4 years as a child.

{"id": "1688_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Morning Panic Hey everyone, \n\nTo give you some background, I use to work in a locked mental health facility for children and it wasn't the best run facility. I worked there a year and a half and I had my hair pulled, been spit on, punched, kicked, slapped, insulted, ect. There were periods of time where I would get hurt everyday at work for weeks. Not to mention hearing/seeing all the stories of what the kids went through and having to do \"therapeutic holds\" on children that are going through a mental health crisis.  I ended up leaving that job shortly after I got divorced and I have a great new job that is way lower stress/anxiety/trauma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell now here I am about a year later and every morning when I wake up I panic about having to go to work. I get so worked up I generally throw up every morning while getting ready for work and sometimes I have to pull over to throw up again. I have talked about this to my old therapist and I am finding a new therapist (just changed over insurance due getting a new job). I don't know what to do about this. The thing that has helped most is deep breathing exercises, but it usually takes me calming down on the hour drive to work to just get to a point where I can function.

{"id": "2423_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Greif or PTSD? My 21 year old cousin ended his life one month ago. The night he did, I went over to my uncle's house for support along with my sister and my uncle's sister.What I didn't know until i got there, was that his body was still there. My sister wanted to say goodbye and trying to be the supportive big sister, I decided I would go with her. \n\nThese next few parts may be triggering to people as I go into detail about the manner of death. Which is important for my current issues. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n&gt;!!&lt;\n \nHe ended his life by placing trash bags around his head and securing them tightly. We believe he may have also used some medicine or alcohol to make him drowsy but we are still awaiting toxicology results. By the time we got there the bags were removed from his body but layed beside him. Initially seeing him helped calm my mind. I had created a much more gruesome picture in my head and truly he looked very peaceful like he was just taking a nap on his bed. We also found his cellphone, he made a playlist on YouTube titled \"the end\" and it was the last thing he listened to. The playlist contained only songs from Weezer, which happened to be one of my favorite bands. \n\nI was sitting downstairs in their living room when the staff from the funeral home came to collect him. The thing that broke me, was hearing them zip up his body. I guess at that point it became real to me. Seeing him at his viewing also ruined me. He looked nothing like himself. He was caked with so much makeup but I could still see the bruising. \n\nSince then, I cant sleep a full 8 hours. I think the most I've gotten in one night straight was 4 hours. I wake up continuously, often laying awake until my alarm goes off for work. When I do sleep, I'm often having nightmares.  I dreamed last night my son was dead. The night before that my cousin died all over again. \n\nDuring the day and at work, I'm exhausted, snippy, overeating or not eating at all. I have crying spells daily, the simplest things remind me of everything. I cant take out the trash anymore. It upsets me too much. I cant listen to Weezer anymore. I went to their concert last summer with my husband which happened to be his first concert. That is no longer a happy memory for me. I often get flashbacks seeing his body.\n\nI explained this to my sister and she suggested it may be beyond grief, it may be PTSD. I have been going to therapy, and my next appointment is in Thursday.

{"id": "1617_counseling", "displayed_text": "Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isn't it? Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger. You were betrayed by two people close to you.  That's a complex injury.  I don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life.  Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity. \u00a0I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again.  Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers.  If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while. \u00a0So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy.  Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like \"She doesn't regret the affair\" (you don't know that), \"She doesn't deserve happiness\" (that would be a harsh judgement), or \"She doesn't care that I'm hurt\" (again, there's no evidence of that).  Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. \u00a0When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself \"What evidence supports that thought as truth?\" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile. A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here.  It doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge.  Forgiveness is not about saying that something was \"okay\".  It's about saying \"It happened.  I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time\".  Forgiveness is putting it down.  She. . .  (trust me this is true). . . she carries her own burden of shame for what she did.  For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden.  It only adds to yours. \u00a0Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? You're hurt.  Validate that hurt.
