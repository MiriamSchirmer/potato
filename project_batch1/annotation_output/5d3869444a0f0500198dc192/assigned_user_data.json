After 2yrs, I finally got her to a doctor so she could start an anti-depressant regiment. I didn\u2019t just push her to do it, thinking it would change everything. When we began dating, we had known each other for a few months (work), and anxiety was apparent. I learned of her PTSD and Depression shortly into the relationship. I deal with depression myself, so I wasn\u2019t about to give up on someone for things they can\u2019t control. I was clear with her of my goal for her in our relationship: to be happy and healthy.\n\nHer family life is almost non existent, and she has moved around most of her life. She severed ties with (some of) the abusive relationships in her life about 2 years ago. We moved in together because we spent most of our time together and we wanted to save money. It\u2019s been almost 2 years living together (after only 8-10 months of dating). Cracks are beginning to show.\n\nWe have two roommates, who I like very much. She always got along with them until recently. Our apartment is 2 couples, M-F / M-F. It\u2019s a two bedroom, so yes, it gets a little cramped, even though its a big place, one bathroom is a constant pest. \n\nLately (past 6 months), the girl living with us has made it clear about keeping things clean, using our own appliances.. usual passive-aggressive roommate stuff. I\u2019m used to it, I do NOT take it personally from the girl, we still chat in a very friendly way frequently, and I\u2019m good friends with her boyfriend. I see these grievances as small troubles, roommates setting boundaries, etc.\n\nWe have lived with this couple for the entirety of us living together. Problems just started to arise about 6 months ago. The girl would get pissed at messy bathroom, moldy stuff in fridge, etc. NEVER became vocal about these problems. Began to show some passive aggressive behavior: Slamming bathroom door, leaving notes, sending TWO texts, JUST TWO over a few months.\n\nI see this stuff as normal, my girlfriend is losing her mind. The slamming of bathroom doors led to her having flashbacks of her shitty father. I spoke with the roommate, and explained the situation. It stopped happening. The girl asked that my GF start using her own electric kettle due to overlapping morning schedules. My GF\u2019s electric kettle was given to her by one of her attackers at her last apartment. That was hard to explain to girl, so we gave it away to avoid more triggers for my girlfriend.\n\nNow, my girlfriend is being triggered by the girl loudly doing her own dishes. This, I had to make a stand on. They were not my gf\u2019s dishes. She had no dogs in the fight. Yet she blamed her INCREDIBLE anger where she stormed into our room and stayed for the night, on loud dish-doing. \n\nMy girlfriend is not a clean person. I can deal with it, try to get her to clean, but it is not my roommates\u2019 fault that she is this way. \n\nThe girl left a note on a tupperware container tonight saying \u2018PLEASE DISPOSE\u2019 and my girlfriend lost it. Inside? A month of veggie smoothie mix that had a lump of mold in it so large that I couldn\u2019t wash it down the sink, I had to pick it out and trash it.\n\nMy girlfriend? Threw a fit and LEFT IT OUT on the counter. Walked away from it. Meanwhile the moldy cup in the living room I asked her to clean will start a fight if I bring it up. \n\nThe note? She wrote 'FUCK OFF' on it, then threw it away out of regret(?). Left it for me (I guess?) to clean, like everything else.\n\n\nThis escalation between the girl and my GF is getting out of hand. We are moving in 6months. I believe that my GF is overreacting and its unnecessary anger, stress, and confusion adding to the situation. \n\nI have stood by my GF for almost 3 years. I have read about PTSD, slowly pushed her towards treatment (finally got her to the Dr for anti-depressants, she hadn\u2019t been to a Dr in many many years). I have tried (slowly) to get her to therapy.. we made a few appointments that she canceled (a while ago). \n\nI feel like my GF isn\u2019t trying. She is being overloaded. She is also being selfish and rude when that is in NO WAY the person I knew years ago. I have been patient with her conditions. I have tried nothing but to help her. I have made stands on some things (almost exclusively cleaning, especially our room that looks like a disaster area, due to her). I\u2019m approaching the end of my rope. Completely ignoring me begging her for years to clean, explaining that it stresses me out the way her triggers do, is starting to really piss me off and make me feel like she doesn't care about my happiness if it means an ounce of work for her. \n\n**TL;DR** My GF is freaking out over my roommate\u2019s recent actions. I believe it is a completely irrational response. I have taken triggers into consideration, but believe she is being selfish and closing off. I have tried to help her as much as possible, but I have my fears that if this is how she acts now, what will our future (on a different coast we\u2019re moving to) hold. That fear has me questioning our future, viability, health, etc.\n\nAny input would help. I can\u2019t possibly say I fully understand PTSD, but I have tried for years to help her, and plan to continue. I feel insensitive when claiming a trigger or her anxiety in certain situations if irrational, but I truly feel this has been. I can give more specifics about her PTSD.
