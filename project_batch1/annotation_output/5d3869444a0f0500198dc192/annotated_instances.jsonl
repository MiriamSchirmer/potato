I tried to block my ears and i had my eyes closed, but the scene sprung up out of nowhere so i saw about 2 seconds of it.   \n\n\nEver since then I've been a mess. I've barely been able to shower, haven't been able to clean, haven't been able to eat, I didn't sleep properly for a few days (kept waking up every half hour). A couple of nights ago half way through sex I had a flashback and I don't remember anything after that, but apparently I was crying a lot and completely non verbal for a while. I 'completely shut down' and he had to really try to get any words out of me, apparently. the next morning i had false awakenings where i was just lying in bed being spooned, then his hand comes and grabs my mouth and shoves me into the bed. i woke up in a panic and realised he was just cuddling me so i must be dreaming, but other than that i absolutely can't distinguish what i dreamt from reality. I realise i've had the same thing before - dreams where 'arms', sometimes someones, sometimes invisible arms, grab my mouth and shove me into the bed.   \n\n\nI have PTSD but I don't actually know what the cause is. I can make a very good guess, but I just have symptoms and learning my triggers, with no actual solid memories. apparently once I told a friend what i thought happened while i was throwing up and crying and screaming (first ever flashback episode), but i don't have any memory of even doing that.   \n\n\nThere was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't. He says it never happened. Now with this false awakening, I'm worried that I've thought ill of him when it actually was just all in my head. What if it was just a false awakening.   \n\n\nI haven't been able to stop crying. i have this constant feeling of terror. And i have no one around me to help. because of my ptsd i push everyone away one way or another. when something triggers me like this i can end up completely non functional. i just want a normal fucking life and a normal brain and a boyfriend. i feel like i'm never going to be able to have any of that because of what some fucking cunt decided to do to a little kid.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 771, "end": 827, "span": "I was crying a lot and completely non verbal for a while", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1071, "end": 1091, "span": "i woke up in a panic", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1401, "span": "I have PTSD", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1909, "span": "There was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't.

Hopefully someone can help or at least understand what I'm struggling with.\nI've been through major trauma 8 years ago, as I was walking home from school a man attacked me. He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.\nHe eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.\nWhat followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. \nI've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.\nMy family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). \nI couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.\n\nI kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost. I couldn't hold memories for a while and if you ask me about my last year in high school it's pretty confusing, I just remember parts and not in order. Depression, anxiety, fear or strangers, panic attacks and dissociation would come and go. \nSometimes I'd just not feel anything, and sometimes I'd be angry at people for not understanding me.\nI started doing therapy and slowly healing but still found it hard to deal with my emotions.\n\nEventually, I went to this Buddhist temple and started meditating, which really helped me and brought me back to reality. I stopped having panick attacks and was able to not think about it so much.\nGoing to college also helped, cause it felt like a new stage of life and I quit therapy because I felt no need to keep going.\n\nNow, I've been doing pretty well in my life and most of the time don't even think about what happened. But the other day I read on the news about a 3 year old who was sexually abused, she was found with her diaper full of blood. Just typing this makes my eyes well up.\nI can't stop thinking about that, about how fucked up the world is, and keep having flashbacks of what happened to me. It's making me depressed, affecting my relationships, my sex life and daily life.\nI'm living far from my family, and I don't wanna tell them what's going on because they will just feel upset and powerless.\nI try to forgive myself for not doing anything like running or kicking him, or just paying more attention because I didn't even see him approach me.. \nI guess now I'm just having a mix of emotions, I don't wanna live in the past but I'm not feeling connected to the present no matter how hard I try.\n\nI feel very lonely because the people who love me can't really understand my feelings and I know they hurt too, but in a different way. I feel helpless.\nI'm not even sure this is just PTSD or something else, if there is anything I can or should do... \n\nThank you for reading.

{"id": "1436_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Hands On Again 3 or 4 months ago my boyfriend put his hands on me.  6 months pregnant and this guy had my face to the ground with his hand around neck leaving pretty red marks on dark skin.  As soon as he let me go I scoured away like a hurt puppy and started having a panic attack.  At least I think that\u2019s what it was.  I found it hard to breath.  Each breathe was hard to catch and felt like my first after deep sea diving.  I was shaking, scared to believe this guy just hurt me.\n\nToday that \u2018panic\u2019 feeling came back.  What started as a back and forth argument turned into him \u2018playing around\u2019 with me.  Him behind me, covered my mouth and nose and just pulled my face back and my neck was straining.  I panicked because I\u2019m 35 weeks now and the baby started tightening in my belly.  I couldn\u2019t really breath.  I tried pulling his hands back away from my mouth to tell him to stop but his weight pushed me down into the couch making things harder.  By the time I got him to let go he started to pat my back as I gasped for air like the first night.  He asked me if I was ok..  I was shaking and I just repeated the same words as I did before, \u201cplease just get away from me\u201d.  \n\nI think that was a ptsd moment - I don\u2019t know.  But since then I can\u2019t even stand to be in the same room as him.  He says he was playing around but I know that wasn\u2019t a game.  I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.  That was the scariest part.  It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion. \n\nI know most of you will say \u2018you need to leave\u2019 or something obvious - yes I know.

{"id": "2275_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Vision Boards for those of us with PTSD In 2016, I was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). At the time of diagnosis, things in my life were going great. I had decided to try Art Therapy to tap into my own creativity and learn some new techniques. At the very first meeting, the therapist asked me simple questions that started to unnerve me.\n\n\u201cDo you sit facing doors and windows?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cLook at where you are sitting.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cIf that window behind you was a door, would you have sat there?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not. No way. I didn\u2019t even know there was a window there\u2026.\u201d\n\nEventually, I was given my diagnosis. It was hard to breathe. I thought all my little quarks where \u201cGod-given\u201d. Things like \u2013 I\u2019ve never lost my car in a parking lot, no matter the circumstances \u2013 I know when an actor is wearing contacts that slightly change the color of their natural eyes \u2013 I can tell the make of most cars in the dark just by their head-lights. These are all survival tactics my brain has developed over my lifetime living with PTSD.\n\nWhy would I have this? I wasn\u2019t in a war. I wasn\u2019t a victim of domestic violence. This is what I associated with PTSD, at the time. My Art Therapist explained that PTSD can happen when the brain feels extremely unsafe. The situations vary with each person and their age at the time of the event.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I was diagnosed and I\u2019ve met so many people who also live with PTSD. One of them is our friend, Kim Preske. This week, she shares her vision board story of self-care and living with PTSD. The images she was drawn to manifested in a completely different and amazing way than she ever expected. Her story will inspire you to listen to your own body and trust your instincts in ways you may not realize.\n\nTake a listen: https://leadershipisart.com/1292/\n\nTo learn more about Kim, visit the Healing Hearts Counseling Center in Hanover, PA at www.healingheartscounselingcenterllc.com.\n\nMy amazing Art Therapist, Brenda can be found at www.arttherapystudios.net.\n\nConnect with me: \nhttps://leadershipisart.com/team/gina/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/gina-nobile-a3597349/\nhttps://twitter.com/gnobile9\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ginanobile/\n\nBlog: http://laagina.blogspot.com/\n\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1029, "end": 1057, "span": "my lifetime living with PTSD", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 18s "}}
