I just want to vent/ramble/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)\n\nI had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. \n\nI've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. \n\nNope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. \n\nAnd then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then \"wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?\" \n\nAnd then the floodgates started to open. \n\n*  \"Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable\"      \n* \"Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.\"      \n* \"I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me.

He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much.

I know I can\u2019t *technically* have PTSD unless you\u2019re still displaying symptoms 1 month post-trauma, but  having a really hard time coping with it all. I know I can\u2019t think about all the \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019 but it\u2019s so fucking hard not to..\n\nMy life was changed the morning of Wednesday April 10th, 2019. I am not the same person I was prior to the explosion, and it\u2019s so fucking sad/scary/idek how to really describe it.. I was kind of a mess of a person before everything happened. Super fucking anxious and the weirdest ambivert. I avoided eye contact and got spooked easily and idk man people just make me nervous and it gets even worse in social settings. I\u2019ve been on SSRIs for years and have seen multiple therapists and have honestly just been dealing with the highs and lows of mental illness. I\u2019m just a research technician in an academic lab, enjoy my quiet work days and just keep to myself, while helping my bosses and post-docs with whatever\u2019s going on that week. \n\nI\u2019ll try to keep it short, but there was a natural gas explosion directly across the street from our vivarium right after my boss and I finished an experiment. As soon as he opened the door, jokingly said \u2018Hmm it smells like gas. Best walk briskly so we don\u2019t get blown up!\u2019 I saw the construction workers across the street crowded around where I occasionally park when running late. I have a HORRIBLE sense of smell, so I was taking in the air, trying to remember what natural gas smelled like. Continuing down the sidewalk, I remember saying, \u2018good thing you\u2019re here because you know I can\u2019t smell, I wouldn\u2019t have had a clue!\u2019 \n\nThere were 2 seconds left on the crosswalk; knowing he\u2019s a stickler with the rules I quickly paused as I watched my boss step into the road, speed walking through the white lines of the intersection. As soon as we crossed the street.. BOOM!!! \n\nIt was almost an out of body experience, the whole thing really. The shock wave from the explosion pushed us down the sidewalk, I felt it go through my body and down the sidewalk in front of me. All of the windows outside the building next to us instantaneously shattered, raining down on us and into our eyes.. I remember looking at my boss as he screamed at me to run. \n\nMy ears.. it was like a tornado had just ripped through my head.. then then the pounding and ringing started. I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn\u2019t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming \u2018WHAT THE FUCK\u2019 at each other out of shock.\n\nPeople starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating \u2018don\u2019t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.\u2019 I remember the confused look on their faces..\n\nIt\u2019s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I\u2019m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me. If we had finished our experiment a minute later, or stayed at the crosswalk, or happened to walk at a slower pace.. it\u2019s so fucking terrifying. I\u2019m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. \n\nBegging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they\u2019re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it\u2019s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...\n\nIt\u2019s only been 4 days, but it feels like it\u2019s been an eternity. I didn\u2019t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it\u2019s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...\n\nI do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. \n\n\nBut at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen?

I know I can\u2019t *technically* have PTSD unless you\u2019re still displaying symptoms 1 month post-trauma, but  having a really hard time coping with it all. I know I can\u2019t think about all the \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019 but it\u2019s so fucking hard not to..\n\nMy life was changed the morning of Wednesday April 10th, 2019. I am not the same person I was prior to the explosion, and it\u2019s so fucking sad/scary/idek how to really describe it.. I was kind of a mess of a person before everything happened. Super fucking anxious and the weirdest ambivert. I avoided eye contact and got spooked easily and idk man people just make me nervous and it gets even worse in social settings. I\u2019ve been on SSRIs for years and have seen multiple therapists and have honestly just been dealing with the highs and lows of mental illness. I\u2019m just a research technician in an academic lab, enjoy my quiet work days and just keep to myself, while helping my bosses and post-docs with whatever\u2019s going on that week. \n\nI\u2019ll try to keep it short, but there was a natural gas explosion directly across the street from our vivarium right after my boss and I finished an experiment. As soon as he opened the door, jokingly said \u2018Hmm it smells like gas. Best walk briskly so we don\u2019t get blown up!\u2019 I saw the construction workers across the street crowded around where I occasionally park when running late. I have a HORRIBLE sense of smell, so I was taking in the air, trying to remember what natural gas smelled like. Continuing down the sidewalk, I remember saying, \u2018good thing you\u2019re here because you know I can\u2019t smell, I wouldn\u2019t have had a clue!\u2019 \n\nThere were 2 seconds left on the crosswalk; knowing he\u2019s a stickler with the rules I quickly paused as I watched my boss step into the road, speed walking through the white lines of the intersection. As soon as we crossed the street.. BOOM!!! \n\nIt was almost an out of body experience, the whole thing really. The shock wave from the explosion pushed us down the sidewalk, I felt it go through my body and down the sidewalk in front of me. All of the windows outside the building next to us instantaneously shattered, raining down on us and into our eyes.. I remember looking at my boss as he screamed at me to run. \n\nMy ears.. it was like a tornado had just ripped through my head.. then then the pounding and ringing started. I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn\u2019t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming \u2018WHAT THE FUCK\u2019 at each other out of shock.\n\nPeople starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating \u2018don\u2019t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.\u2019 I remember the confused look on their faces..\n\nIt\u2019s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I\u2019m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me. If we had finished our experiment a minute later, or stayed at the crosswalk, or happened to walk at a slower pace.. it\u2019s so fucking terrifying. I\u2019m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. \n\nBegging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they\u2019re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it\u2019s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...\n\nIt\u2019s only been 4 days, but it feels like it\u2019s been an eternity. I didn\u2019t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it\u2019s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...\n\nI do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. \n\n\nBut at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen? It\u2019s all so surreal and yes I\u2019m extremely thankful to be alive, but the survivors guilt immediately crept in. I\u2019m a trained BLS instructor, and I just ran.. I understand there was nothing I could do to save anyone, but I still feel so much guilt and shame.. \n\nI just needed to get it all out.
