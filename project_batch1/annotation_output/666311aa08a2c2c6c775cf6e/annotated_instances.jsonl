The abuse (molested) started in preschool and didn\u2019t stop until December 2015 or 2016. \n\nIn addition to being a CSA survivor, I lost my mom May 30th, 2019. She had multiple health issues before my brother and I were born and got worse over the last 10 years. For reference my brother was born in July 1998 and I was born in February 2000. Anyways, I had a dream I watched her die of a heart attack and sure enough 3 days later she died, most likely of a heart attack. My dad and I had gone to the store and when we got back she was face down on the floor, next to her bed. We had only been out for 40-50 minutes. I had my brother call 911 while I took our dogs in my room so the paramedics could do their thing. I knew she was gone soon as I saw her body. After I don\u2019t know how much time passed she was declared dead. I still had to stay with the dogs because of the medical examiners and funeral home people, so after some more time passed we shut the door to my parents room so I could talk with our pastor and cry with my family. Soon as I saw the foot of the body bag I walked to my room with my back turned to it. I didn\u2019t want to see her get rolled out... but just when I thought the funeral people had already taken her outside, I turned around. It was a mistake. I saw her face in the body bag as they rolled her out and no matter how much everything told me to look away, I couldn\u2019t. \n\nEver since then I\u2019ve had countless dreams where I see her die, see my friends go missing and/or end up dead, and see my dad die. I also experience flashbacks that replay the scene of the night she died. I also have flashbacks to when I was molested even though it\u2019s been almost 3 years since it stopped.

A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn\u2019t stand with out pain.\nFor the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I\u2019d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn\u2019t go in I\u2019d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn\u2019t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.\nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time\n\nIv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can\u2019t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don\u2019t really talk in therapy session and the reply\u2019s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school\n\nThere\u2019s an emotion I feel when I\u2019m in a state sometimes, it\u2019s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it\u2019s like there\u2019s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there\u2019s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I\u2019m experiencing and I\u2019m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can\u2019t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.\n  |\n^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^\n\nNo one ever told me what ptsd really entails, if you cold give me a little insight, it would be appreciated.  x\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 193, "end": 384, "span": "car crash on the way to school.
