I am having a hard time figuring out how to get my eyes to stay focused or to even focus on what I am looking at.  I think the reason and so does my counselor, is because I don't feel I can trust the people around me which would make sense.  It happens when people yell at me.  I flash back to memories where I feel I need to defend myself and I shouldn't have or future events that .
