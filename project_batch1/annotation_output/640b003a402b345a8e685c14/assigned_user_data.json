He withdraws and does not want to talk about anything, responding with short snippets. He pushes me away, believing he is a burden and will only drag me down. He sometimes asks loaded questions that indicate this. He has a self-sacrifice mentality for sure. He finds it very hard to trust me, which is okay. I do my best not to push him to talk about things he doesn't want to. He won't help me help him. We talk about how we can better communicate and figure these things out, but I'm not a mind reader. When he withdraws, I don't know how to approach him. \n\nHe's extremely alert all of the time, jumping at slight sounds and disturbances. I remind him it's okay every time he apologizes for this. His nightmares will wake me up sometimes, and I try not to make him feel guilty and be supportive. \n\nI just don't know what behavior is a result of PTSD and what is his personality. He's a great person, and I don't want to give up just because of this. I understand that it's something no amount of love and care can just fix, and telling him to get over it isn't helpful either. It seems to me that there's a lot of guilt he carries, and it's hard to see that I can't convince him he's worth helping and fixing. \n\nHow can I stay his partner without becoming his therapist?

My mental health had hit critical about two years ago, I was diagnosed with complex ptsd with suicidal ideation, which I had known for awhile it was most likely that. I started going to therapy, I quit drinking and doing drugs, started medication again, things have been getting better slowly. Now the wall is down, memories and emotions started flooding in, flashbacks started again, suicidal ideation started more frequently ( I will never go through with it) and for the life of me I can't seem to understand how bad my situation was growing up, I know it was wrong and not normal but something is blocking me from viewing it rationally. It was just my life, I have no other perspective or anything I can compare it to.  I'm more writing this out to just to get it out so... Here we go\n\nMy first memory of my father was when I was 2 to 4, my mom was leaving for work, he was hungover I'm assuming and I was crying staring out the window because she was leaving me, I didn't stop after she left, I remember my dad had his hand on his face not looking well, barley attempting to calm me down when he grabbed my pj shirt and slapped me across the face, the memory ends there. Typically he would use a belt or a metal shoe horn, he didn't get more physical until I was older but that is maybe my first memory of my childhood that comes to mind. Everything is fuzzy but that one is clear as day. I would run away from him when I would get in trouble and he would chase me around the house snapping his leather belt over and over until he caught me and would then beat me bare ass with it, I can't remember the pain or even being hit with the belt, I just remember the before it happened. I do remember I would become hysterical often but I can't clear up andly specific memories, I just feel the emotion and I know it happened often. \n\nThe next portion of memories start when I thought my parents, mainly my dad, my mom was never abusive, would turn into wear wolves when I would turn my back, everytime I turned around I thought they were sneaking up on me claws over their heads about to eat me, I would often follow them around and try to catch them, I had a fear of being alone because I always thought they were going to get me if I wasn't paying attention. this continued until around 10 or 11, I don't know why that thought process stopped but it just did.\n\nI know my dad was also verbally abusive but I can't really remember specifics I just know it happened often. Things like don't be a pussy or don't be such a girl with the occasional smack upside the head and such. I was a very sensitive child and wished i had been a girl, maybe because my sister didn't get it as bad as I did, I'm not 100% sure why those thoughts started so early but they were vivid.\n\nAround 9 the abuse started changing and progressing into more abrubt violence, less spankings more being thrown against walls and choked although I can remember only two times this happened I wouldn't be suprised if it was more often, smacks across the head, the verbal abuse escalated into more of a bully harassing way, he would do things to just tease or torment me, specific memories are hard to clear up enough to get a good picture, I remember one time he showed me a pressure point on my foot and refused to let go, I was crying it hurt so bad and ended up hitting him in the face and then he lost his temper idk stuff like that. The inappropriate behavior of exposing me to adult things like porn and inappropriate movies, letting me drink a beer or some wine, no sexual abuse I can remember so that's a relief. I started being more aware of his behavior and knowing he was wrong most of the time , I didn't like the way he would treat people in public, he was very racist, he would often put my mom down, they divorced when I was 7. I also started talking back more and challenging him and he seemed to for the most part loose interest in me, I would often leave the house and spend most of the day with friends in the neighborhood. I had very little parental oversight at this point after the divorce and would mainly fend for myself most of the time. By 8 or 9 during summers I was mostly left to do what I wanted, my sister was there but she was a teen and barley kept tabs on me.\n\nMy suicidal ideation started around 11 In middle school where I was bullied a lot, the change in the social behavior didn't really click for me until around 8th grade when I taught myself how to be accepted. I started drinking often on weekends in 8th grade, smoking cigarettes by 9th I discovered weed and that was my miracle cure, I couldn't stand ever not being high or drunk and almost all of high-school was just one big party that lasted 10 years too long. I was lucky I never enjoyed the harder stuff besides my love of cocain but it never became too much of an issue. At 15 the end of my relationship with my father happened, he picked me up from school when I was sick and we got in a fight where he punched me several times in the face and I jumped from his moving car, he never got in trouble for it, my mom and sister begged me not to press charges and that was pretty much the end of my relationship with them as well, since the defended him, my sister took his side and my mom who is a push over just wanted the drama to go away and kept trying to get me to forgive him, I lost all respect for either of them and realized I was on my own.

It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers", "displayed_text": "Some thoughts on dissociation?

The one label I have identified with since then is the good ol\u2019 \u201canxiety\u201d. Everyone has it. So in a sense I have felt \u201cnormal\u201d. I have worked through a bunch of things that I attributed to how my parents raised me and I would honestly say that I am a generally happy, positive person.\n\nNow, here is what got me started on thinking about this: A few days ago I did coke for the first time ever (I\u2019m not a druggie. All I have done is the somewhat regular weed and occasional alcohol). No big deal. I didn\u2019t trip out or enjoy it. I simply felt nothing from it. I snorted my last dose of it close to 10PM. At around 3AM I tried to sleep. I was at a cheap motel and in the room next us there were some people having a party and talking a little too loud, walking in and out of the room. Sometimes it sounded like they would be walking into my room \u2014 a thought which I could easily dismiss but a feeling that I couldn\u2019t shake. I was on full-on alert. I felt as if I was going to be \u201cdisturbed\u201d, that something or someone would be making me get up and I was scared. The more I thought of it, the less what I felt seemed cocaine-related, and the more I could think about other times I felt the same way.\n\nSo, here is my background:\nI am from a neigbourhood called Piedade, in Rio de Janeiro. Born and raised there until I was 8/9 years old. I moved with my family around Brazil until I was 15, at which point we moved to Canada. \nRio is a dangerous (!!!), violent place. My neighbourhood was a favela. Not the worst one but a favela nevertheless. I can recall most nights falling asleep to the sounds of gunshots. I can\u2019t really recall the sound of gunshots nowadays until I hear one. I have been caught up in the line of fire quite a few times. Most of them were on the streets and we would just stay put in corners of the house. Some of them were while I was out on the streets and had to just scoot down in the car or run and hide inside nearby stores. One of my earliest memories is of me being woken up in a hurry by my parents. They just grabbed me and my brother and took us to the bathroom. Our doors and windows were gridded and someone \u2014 or in my memory as a child, something scary \u2014 was banging on them. I honestly don\u2019t remember much of that anymore. Just the paralyzing fear, attentiveness, confusion. What happened was that someone was getting followed by a gang to be killed. We had a big yard and this guy jumped into our property. My parents, who were outside, heard neighbours yelling to warn them and they ran inside to get us. The gang arrived, our neighbor was an ex cop, and a shootout happened all around us. But like I said, it\u2019s mostly a feeling to me.\nWe left Rio when I was 8/9 and I witnessed a lot less of that type of violence. I continued to witness robberies and assaults. A lot of noisy situations. Looking back at it, robbers tend to make their presences known when they are trying to intimidate people with noise.\nAnyway, that was until I was 15 and we left to come to Canada.\n15 was also just about the age when my dad stopped hitting me. He had some anger bursts for no good reason.\nIn a few instances in Brazil, and once in Canada, I was groped very indiscreetly.\nThen in Canada, once I was 18/19 I was living alone in a basement. I got out of my shower, heard some loud bangs on my door. I froze. Some people burst through, looked at me, ran away. I was shocked but still managed to call the cops right away. I just couldn\u2019t think properly enough to explain it to them in as much detail as they wanted.\n\nSo here I am today. I have recurring nightmares quite often. I would say I could go a week having nightmares only. Someone usually dies in my dreams. Most times I am killed in it, other times I am the one killing. Occasionally, in these dreams, someone else will die in front of me. In real life when I hear loud noises my mind freezes. If someone is talking to me after a noisy disturbance I can \u201cgo with it\u201d but about 30 seconds to a few minutes later I have to ask them to rewind because I wasn\u2019t \u201cthere\u201d anymore. I have really, really, really light sleep. I feel tired all the time. I don\u2019t like spending nights alone at home. Sometimes not even days. If I do, I keep checking on doors, windows and peep behind curtains. If I\u2019m alone I barely sleep or sleep super late until it\u2019s light out. I don\u2019t feel comfortable in loud places (unless there\u2019s rythm/music).\n\nAnyway, like I said in the beginning, I am still a generally happy person. My anxiety, other than what I just described above, is not a big part of my life anymore. But also, what I call anxiety I have usually attributed to that \u201cworrying\u201d feeling that I will fail or something will go wrong because of me and my decisions (money, school). So, I guess I am wondering if what I described is something like ptsd or if I am just being dramatic and trying to label myself again. But also, part of me feels as if I have made huge progress with my anxiety and that it shed a light into something hidden deeper \u2014 I have made peace with the things I used to blame for my anxiety, yet some feelings of uneasiness linger on. I was wondering if I could have ptsd to any extent (none or mild to moderate maybe?). \n\nPlease tell me what you think.

I was doing \"wild\" things like partying and clubbing on the weekends and even one night stands with strangers from the bar or online dating apps, and other \"wild fun\" things (that I prefer not to mention for the sake of my career) I would NEVER thought I'd do based on who I \"was\" prior military.\n\nHowever, the happier I'm becoming the more angrier I have been getting lately thinking about my past. I'm talking about being cheerful and jolly one minute, singing with the radio driving home from work then suddenly out of no where I'll have flashbacks of shitty times in my childhood    and next thing you know I'm punching my steering wheel and clenching my jaw and just really want to fly back across the United States just to give my family whom I RARELY talk to now, a piece of my mind.\n\n I grew up in a conservative Chinese family. Being a Chinese male, I had a very \"stereotypical\" boring childhood and even lamer time in highschool and college. However, I was not a good student and was a handful as a child that I will admit but I have never thought that my family was abusive until lately and even talked to my co-workers about it.\n\nTo keep things from getting too long I'll list out the things I experienced growing up and always thought was normal until my coworkers and friends pointed out it really wasn't:\n\n- I was strongly influenced to not have friends and always put my family before anyone.\n\n- Even until I was 22 years old I was not to be trusted to have friends over the house without an adult or my brother whom was allowed to have friends over anytime he pleased since he was 18\n\n- My brother (5 years older than me) got to decide whether I can go out or must stay home regardless if there was a reason or not.\n\n- My brother can also tell me I can't have any friends over even when I was 21 years old and still lived with me and my parents.\n\n- My brother would enforce me as a child to \"pat-down\" all my friends who came over to the apartment we lived in to ensure nobody stole anything. This rule did not apply to my brother's friends.\n\n- My mother has threatened to kill herself  and me multiple times when I was a child growing up. Sometimes she would take a meat cleaver to her neck and scream at me and my brother that shes going to cut her head off and kill herself because of us. And sometimes -\n\n- My mother would swerve into the wrong side of the road towards oncoming traffic when we were bad, threatening to kill us and herself.\n\n- When my brother was old enough to drive and he would also swerve into oncoming traffic if I he was mad at me or if we got into a disagreement.\n\n- Ironically, when I was old enough to drive, I also did the same thing to a friend who is still considered one of my closest friend to this day. He pissed me off and I thought threatening his life would help me win the argument.\n\n- I also remember when I was very young my mom told me not to go outside because I had some kind of allergy or Asthma, I did not listen and helped my grandma with her yard because she was going to pay me 20$. I told her and she put her hands around my neck shook my neck and told me she was going to kill me, very angrily and very convincing at least at the time to me.\n\n- More less severe things is that my brother acted like he owned me, like if I wanted to go out and my mother said I could and my brother said I can't he would threaten to take away my games.\n\n- whenever he disallowed me to do things he would sometimes include statements like \"not in my house\" this fucking bitch didn't own shit. He's had three cars handed to him and gave me shit and tried to claim he bought one of the my mom bought him brand new, which I confronted my mom about. \n\n- I believe my step-dad might have caught on to my brother's bullshit and convinced my mom and him that it was time for him to move out.\n\nAnyways , I literally just started having angry flashbacks just now while writing the last three.

And sometimes -\n\n- My mother would swerve into the wrong side of the road towards oncoming traffic when we were bad, threatening to kill us and herself.\n\n- When my brother was old enough to drive and he would also swerve into oncoming traffic if I he was mad at me or if we got into a disagreement.\n\n- Ironically, when I was old enough to drive, I also did the same thing to a friend who is still considered one of my closest friend to this day. He pissed me off and I thought threatening his life would help me win the argument.\n\n- I also remember when I was very young my mom told me not to go outside because I had some kind of allergy or Asthma, I did not listen and helped my grandma with her yard because she was going to pay me 20$. I told her and she put her hands around my neck shook my neck and told me she was going to kill me, very angrily and very convincing at least at the time to me.\n\n- More less severe things is that my brother acted like he owned me, like if I wanted to go out and my mother said I could and my brother said I can't he would threaten to take away my games.\n\n- whenever he disallowed me to do things he would sometimes include statements like \"not in my house\" this fucking bitch didn't own shit. He's had three cars handed to him and gave me shit and tried to claim he bought one of the my mom bought him brand new, which I confronted my mom about. \n\n- I believe my step-dad might have caught on to my brother's bullshit and convinced my mom and him that it was time for him to move out.\n\nAnyways , I literally just started having angry flashbacks just now while writing the last three. I think I have more of a grudge towards my brother than my mother.
