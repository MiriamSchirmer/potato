I know that the title seems dramatic, but please look at it in a literal sense. \n\n\\-Backstory Time\n\nMy mother was married four times, and her third husband, was addicted to pills. I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. \n\nMy mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. \n\nI know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.\n\nMy mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-It's all downhill from here folks.\n\nSo how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Almost up to speed\n\nI have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. \n\nIt was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for reading guys, I feel a little better, feel free to inbox me or comment!", "displayed_text": "I am too scared to live my life how I want to.

However, I'm studying abroad in france for this semester and I'm about to run out of this medication, and I cant get anyone to prescribe me a medication I feel comfortable taking, so I may just have to go off my meds. In france it seems that doctors just automatically want to give you xanex for anything anxiety related, obviously I dont think theres anything wrong with taking Xanex in general, if it helps someone thats great but since I have been taking a non-addictive medication in the states that has worked wonders, and my US doctor has made it clear she doesn't like prescribing Xanex unless nothing else works I'm incredibly uncomfortable with it. I have now been going to doctors appointments for a month now trying to get something I can take (I've taken SSRI's before, and while they still leave me with way too many mental illness symptoms, the worst of them are gone), and of the 5 different doctors appointments I've had all have been really against prescribing me anything other than  Xanex. Im honestly just so scared, the last time I went off medications I failed every assignment I had during that time period, and spent almost every second of my day in bed feeling like crap, and this time, since I'm abroad I don't even have friends that I can reach out to in person, just through text for the second half of the day, thanks to the time difference. I've already noticed my mental health getting significantly worse just from the stressed cause by all this. I'm just so worried, and I know the worry is just going to make everything worse, because even though i'm medicated right now its making me miserable, so I'm going to crash fast and of course I'm going to dun out right in the middle of midterm week. Anyways thanks for reading all this, I just needed to get it out somewhere and I didn't know where else to go.
