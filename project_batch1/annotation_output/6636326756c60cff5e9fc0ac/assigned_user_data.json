I think because it was that stage that lasted the longest (an hour or two), it hurt me more mentally than the usual 30 seconds to a minute of when he did hurt me physically, Idk maybe easier to block out than the awful screaming and personal attacks.\nI also get nightmares of the cheating and of being an inadequate woman. \n\nI also have noticed I tend to flinch pretty dramatically when things are thrown or tossed at me when I'm unaware.

I'm 34. What else is life going to throw at me??\n\nI mean wtf?? I'm so tired of getting knocked back. I've had psychological issues and possible PTSD from the trauma of getting burned as a kid...and my mom never addressed it. She kept saying that something was wrong with me and I needed to get fixed (that I was broken). Well...duh! I suffered trauma at a young age. Then because of her emotional neglect and abuse I've spent the majority of my adult life working on my self worth and going through therapy.\n\nWhen I think life is good...I get hit by a car head on in 2016.

If the outside world wasn't safe...surely my own body is safe? Wrong.\n\nNow I had PTSD related to body sensations. Being on blood thinners for 8 months was horrible. I felt sick and weak and scared all the time. But I got through it. I went to therapy. I processed. Then again life was seeming okay. I was healing and getting more safe.\n\nThen I get hit by another car. Rear ended while stopped behind a bus and pushed into a pole on the side walk. This was June 2019. I've had vertigo and neck pain. My poor brain and body can't take any more of this trauma. My emotions can't. It's hard to drive. I get scared at any fast car around me thinking how easy it is for one of them to not pay attention and then kill me. Maybe the next one will kill me because life seems to want to do that.\n\nI'm just really tired. What'll I do? Just keep existing until something else traumatic comes along.\n\nMy relationship with my bf may also be ending. Not in anger or drama...in sadness that sometimes it just doesn't work out.

(Trigger warning) First, I'm not suicidal. So when I say I'm tired of life...I don't mean I'm ending it. I just want to acknowkedge that life just really fucking sucks sometimes. And it's tough. And exhausting. And frustrating. And full of chaos and unfairness.\n\nI've had a difficult life. Not as difficult as some but just a lot of bad unfair things happening to me and me not deserving any of it.\n\nI've been burned (when I was 3), emotionally abused by my mom, hit by three cars (all from distracted drivers...i was actually stopped in the 2 recent ones and people just hit me...causing concussions and disc bulge and severe whiplash), abused in a toxic relationship, dealt with depression, self harm, anxiety, and had a pulmonary embolism because of birth control. I'm 34. What else is life going to throw at me??\n\nI mean wtf?? I'm so tired of getting knocked back. I've had psychological issues and possible PTSD from the trauma of getting burned as a kid...and my mom never addressed it. She kept saying that something was wrong with me and I needed to get fixed (that I was broken). Well...duh! I suffered trauma at a young age. Then because of her emotional neglect and abuse I've spent the majority of my adult life working on my self worth and going through therapy.\n\nWhen I think life is good...I get hit by a car head on in 2016. I now have chronic pain. It was so hard dealing with all that pain and the hopelessness and depression and PTSD. But I got through it. I started to heal. Then I got a pulmonary embolism in 2017. If the outside world wasn't safe...surely my own body is safe? Wrong.\n\nNow I had PTSD related to body sensations. Being on blood thinners for 8 months was horrible. I felt sick and weak and scared all the time. But I got through it. I went to therapy. I processed. Then again life was seeming okay. I was healing and getting more safe.\n\nThen I get hit by another car. Rear ended while stopped behind a bus and pushed into a pole on the side walk. This was June 2019. I've had vertigo and neck pain. My poor brain and body can't take any more of this trauma. My emotions can't. It's hard to drive. I get scared at any fast car around me thinking how easy it is for one of them to not pay attention and then kill me. Maybe the next one will kill me because life seems to want to do that.\n\nI'm just really tired. What'll I do? Just keep existing until something else traumatic comes along.\n\nMy relationship with my bf may also be ending. Not in anger or drama...in sadness that sometimes it just doesn't work out. That love isn't enough when two people have opposing needs or values. We love each other but that doesn't mean it'll work.\n\nI wish I just had an okay life. That I grew up in a supportive household and that I don't know what it's like for an 800 pound object to be speeding towards me, completely helpless in every way. \n\nThere's no control in life. Only trying and hoping something bad doesn't happen. But it does. It always does."}, "1926_ptsd": {"id": "1926_ptsd", "text": "Suggestions for PTSD symptoms I have been getting some nightmares again.
