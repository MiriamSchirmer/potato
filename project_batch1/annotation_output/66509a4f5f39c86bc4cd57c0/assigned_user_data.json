I've always thought I had something along the lines of PTSD, however I used to associate PTSD with being in the military so I thought I didn't have it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try to make this short. Ever since I was a kid I have always been incredibly withdrawn when around people. I was okay around immediate family and very close friends, but when around people I didn't have a deep connection with (which was pretty much everyone except for a select few) I would completely shut down. I remember my stomach would get extremely tight and simultaneously my brain felt like it was being shut off. I couldn't find words so I wouldn't talk. From ages 3-15 I went through school only talking if I was forced to (usually by teachers), which resulted in me never saying a word for 95% of the time. I would try to communicate with others by body language (nodding head, shrugging shoulders, etc), because I was unable to talk to them. Even when I wanted to, immense fear would wash over me and I would clam up even more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hated this about myself but for the majority of my school years I couldn't change even though I desperately wanted to. When freshman year started and I was in a new school, I made it my mission to get over this and talk more.

The thing is I don't know why I acted that way.

I've always thought I had something along the lines of PTSD, however I used to associate PTSD with being in the military so I thought I didn't have it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try to make this short. Ever since I was a kid I have always been incredibly withdrawn when around people. I was okay around immediate family and very close friends, but when around people I didn't have a deep connection with (which was pretty much everyone except for a select few) I would completely shut down. I remember my stomach would get extremely tight and simultaneously my brain felt like it was being shut off. I couldn't find words so I wouldn't talk. From ages 3-15 I went through school only talking if I was forced to (usually by teachers), which resulted in me never saying a word for 95% of the time. I would try to communicate with others by body language (nodding head, shrugging shoulders, etc), because I was unable to talk to them. Even when I wanted to, immense fear would wash over me and I would clam up even more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hated this about myself but for the majority of my school years I couldn't change even though I desperately wanted to. When freshman year started and I was in a new school, I made it my mission to get over this and talk more. I was able to progress slightly for about a year and a half, but halfway through sophomore year I started becoming severely depressed (which lasted throughout the rest of highschool), and I reverted back into my old self. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was told that I was \"just shy as a kid,\" but I know it was something deeper than that.

Could u guys describe what happens when you dissociate like the most realistic one cuz one time\nI was able to take a taxi all around California but in my mind I was at a friends birthday party and it\u2019s like I was behaving normally and functioning enough to get multiple taxis without people noticing anything junisial but I was immersed in an alternate reality of a birthday party with friends and demons and scary sh#t runnin around , and I\u2019m trying to make sense of it cuz it has me questioning what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not it would help if someone could tell me they\u2019ve had anything like that cuz I\u2019ve heard of dissociation but haven\u2019t heard of where people are still behaving normal but their immersed in another reality. I\u2019ve heard of out of body experiences but that\u2019s usually wher people are like looking at their body from an outside perspective , but this is where I was in a whole nother reality seeing it from MY perspective ( 1st person perception as they say in video games ) has anyone had anything like what I described? When u get flashbacks does u body still behave normally or does it \u201cact out\u201d the internal experience?"}, "416_counseling": {"id": "416_counseling", "text": "Behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training, both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family members.It is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not, to expect both sides to get along harmoniously.In order to achieve this, the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autism.This would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isn't part of summer camp for children.What you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism, is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administrators.Ultimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write, the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates.", "displayed_text": "Behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training, both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family members.It is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not, to expect both sides to get along harmoniously.In order to achieve this, the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autism.This would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isn't part of summer camp for children.What you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism, is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administrators.Ultimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write, the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates."}, "907_incel": {"id": "907_incel", "text": "Didn't know sausage fattener just got an upgrade.
