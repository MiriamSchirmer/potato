She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. \n\nGoing to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. \n\nI was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.\n\nI dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. \n\nI dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.\n\nHonestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.\n\nI feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. \n\nIt's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. \n\nBut still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. \n\nI'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.\n\nI know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. \n\n**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD.

He has epilepsy so I've always had it in the back of my mind that if I notice anything weird to remain calm, but he is on meds for it and I had never witnessed a seizure before, so seeing him just stare at me and start screeching and convulsing out of the blue one afternoon took me by surprise.  I remained relatively ca and waited it out since he told me before that I shouldn't call an ambulance unless the seizure lasts a long time. I counted less than two minutes, which is fine. When he opened his eyes again, he didn't speak or seem like himself. He was just trying to  get up and climb on furniture while i tried my best to keep him from hurting himself. Eventually, he regained consciousness and asked what happened. I offered to take him to the hospital to get checked out since his dad recommended it over the phone, but he refused. A little later after he was back to normal he was on the phone, and my head rested on his lap. One minute he was talking, then the next minute I heard that awful screech again and jumped up. After two seizures, i decided to just call 911.

Is it possible I have PTSD? Or is it anxiety? I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who do have PTSD and struggle with its symptoms. The last thing I want is to go around waving that phrase around carelessly and take away from those who have it.\nSeveral months ago, my fiance had a seizure in my dorm. He has epilepsy so I've always had it in the back of my mind that if I notice anything weird to remain calm, but he is on meds for it and I had never witnessed a seizure before, so seeing him just stare at me and start screeching and convulsing out of the blue one afternoon took me by surprise.  I remained relatively ca and waited it out since he told me before that I shouldn't call an ambulance unless the seizure lasts a long time. I counted less than two minutes, which is fine. When he opened his eyes again, he didn't speak or seem like himself. He was just trying to  get up and climb on furniture while i tried my best to keep him from hurting himself. Eventually, he regained consciousness and asked what happened. I offered to take him to the hospital to get checked out since his dad recommended it over the phone, but he refused.
