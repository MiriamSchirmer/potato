A few weeks prior to that, I had one seizure, but that was nothing compared to the doubleheader from right before Christmas.

I fell onto the side of the bathtub (luckily the curtains stayed up, haha), then slid onto the floor, completely out of control of anything. I was even making moaning noises and saying \u201cno\u201d repeatedly, but neither of those actions were voluntary.

Hello everyone. I\u2019m sorry for the wall of text.

I\u2019ve just noticed huge changes in a lot of different aspects of my life recently, and I\u2019m looking for answers; google searches gave me results about PTSD leading to seizures, which is the reverse of what I\u2019m looking for.
