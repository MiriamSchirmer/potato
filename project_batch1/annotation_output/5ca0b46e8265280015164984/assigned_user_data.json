He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.\nHe eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.\nWhat followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. \nI've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.\nMy family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). \nI couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.\n\nI kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost.

I decided to come here instead of posting to advice because I think that maybe this would be the more fitting subreddit, but I'm not sure. Maybe one of yall can help me.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was laying in bed and I started to smell something from my childhood - a gross mix of two different scents that I had only ever smelled in one place. It came in out of the blue and I had never had this happen to me before and I have no explanation for it. \n\nI looked everywhere for the possible cause, did everything to make it go away.
