Divorce can be so disruptive in a child's life.I'd really need a lot more information about your situation before I'd feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions. There are so many variables, and not knowing the whole story, any advice could possibly make your situation worse.I do see some positives, though.\u00a0One, you say you have a therapist. That's great! I hope you're able to talk to them about this soon. Still, they can't give you legal advice, and a lot of this situation may be dictated by the law. What your therapist can help with, though, is dealing with whatever situation you have to follow by law. If you can't change the situation, you at least need to learn how to cope with it better.\u00a0Two, you're 17. When you're 18, you're legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place.\u00a0Honestly, teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements. Since you didn't specify more on the situation, I have no idea what your specific situation is. Were your parents ever married? Are they separated or divorced? Was there ever a court hearing for custody? Not all couples have an official court order arrangement. All families are different, too. Was there abuse between your parents? Towards you by one of them? Does either of them have addiction issues, major health or mental health issues, or anything like that? You mentioned that you want to live with your mom, but didn't say why. Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom? Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one, or is there something else going on? This isn't a decision that should be placed entirely on you, and it also isn't a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input. But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you.\u00a0Whatever you do, hang in there! 18 will be here before you know it.

I think I may have PTSD, at least, I appear to meet the DSM 5 criteria for it. The thing is that even the thought of PTSD had never popped into my head before a couple nights ago.\n\nI was watching a cop drama where the main character had to go to a therapist for an evaluation. All of a sudden, BAM, that sounds a lot like me.\n\nSo here\u2019s my story.\n\nLast year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed. I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can\u2019t and even if I could I probably wouldn\u2019t share). Unfortunately, she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn\u2019t save her. I had to relay all this whilst it was happening to my dad and my brother who were back in our home country. \n\nThey were able to come out the next day luckily but I was alone all night.\n\nEver since then I\u2019ve thought that I was just grieving normally for my mother. I do go to a therapist about it once a week. Whenever I talk to people about what happened they always say \u201cit must have been so traumatic\u201d but I myself have never used that word to describe it, not even in my own thoughts.\n\nNow though, I can\u2019t stop thinking that this may actually be affecting me. Actually, I knew how badly I was being affected but I just thought that it was part of the grieving process. I called a friend tonight and told her what I was thinking and she told me that she\u2019s suspected it for months! She didn\u2019t know how to tell me what she thought. I\u2019m not mad or upset at her or anything but I am a bit shocked that someone could come to that conclusion so long before I even thought about it! \n\nI\u2019m not self diagnosing but I would like to know for certain if it is PTSD or not.

He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.\nHe eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.\nWhat followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. \nI've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.\nMy family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). \nI couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.\n\nI kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost.

Depression, anxiety, fear or strangers, panic attacks and dissociation would come and go. \nSometimes I'd just not feel anything, and sometimes I'd be angry at people for not understanding me.\nI started doing therapy and slowly healing but still found it hard to deal with my emotions.\n\nEventually, I went to this Buddhist temple and started meditating, which really helped me and brought me back to reality. I stopped having panick attacks and was able to not think about it so much.\nGoing to college also helped, cause it felt like a new stage of life and I quit therapy because I felt no need to keep going.\n\nNow, I've been doing pretty well in my life and most of the time don't even think about what happened.
