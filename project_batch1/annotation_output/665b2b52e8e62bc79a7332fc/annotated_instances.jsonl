I live with my mom, her bf,my brother ,and my little sister.i am normally the only sibling at the house when they start to argue,well except for my little sister but she is always asleep when it happens. First they start off arguing and it get annoying bc Ik they r going to start fighting!...but then they start to yell loud enough for me to hear what they r saying.sometimes I tell them to stop or I just leave them alone bc they say I make it worse.Im not gonna say what they fight about... but it get pretty bad sometimes. Some of them have turned into physical fights,well most of them...and I always see all of it!and I have seen my mom get pushed and her finger get snapped/broken by her bf.she obviously has to fight back for self defence so she does..but he try\u2019s to convince her to give him another chance and that he will change.he says that every single time and yet he still haven\u2019t changed.I even told my mom that...they suffer from alcohol education and my mom thinks that\u2019s the only way she can fall asleep.and some times she gets black out drunk and gets mad at me easy and when I say something that makes her upset... she takes it out on me and if not me her bf mostly her bf tho.. but some fight have scared me half to death bc I thought it was gonna end up in death. I thought one of them was gonna get killed.And if they r fighting downstairs I can hear them hitting each other if it\u2019s physical or if they r going at each other or push each other and it makes a loud noise, like a bang on the ground or something.\nBut the things I\u2019m experiencing (the after effects) they don\u2019t know about...\nLet me explain.\nSo I have bad anxiety(I haven\u2019t rly been diagnosed with it but my mom know I have it and it\u2019s rly bad to the point where I have anxiety attacks) but I always get triggered when I hear a big stomp upstairs, I always think it\u2019s them fighting again and I get rly scared, but when I go up it\u2019s just my siblings playing around,and I have to try and clap down.\n(Loud bangs,slap sounds ,yells,other noises)scare me anxiety kicks in right away. Also sometimes I wake up and I think they are fighting again but I go down and they are sleeping and it\u2019s just the tv,but it sounded like they are fighting.so I Can\u2019t rly go back to sleep easy. Or if they are talking loud r sometimes just talking Normally and I\u2019m upstairs in my room it\u2019s sound like they are arguing and my anxiety get triggered and I feel like I want to cry,even when my mom is talking on the phone she kinda talks loud a lot bc I think she is losing hearing a little,so she talks a little louder than needed and it triggers me bc I keep thinking I hear them arguing but it\u2019s just them talking normally.\nI have watched this YouTube video and there where parents arguing in it and I immediately started crying bc it gave me some kinda flash back ig and it sounded exactly like there fighting.

Normal jokes with awcual undertones, pretty normal stuff. But what I didn't know was that he has a traumatic past that made such jokes incredibly uncomfortable to him and he never told me I was crossing his boundaries so I did not see it coming a mile away, especially since he and I had been together and had fun shortly before then. \n\nI cried for several hours, just looking at my computer at nothing, crying and wiping my face.

{"id": "2224_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Insomnia and loss of appetite from my event(s) I think that a lot of things have happened in my life that qualify to have caused PTSD, but usually I forced myself to not feel those emotions or try to rationalize the event in my head so I didn\u2019t have to deal with any feeling other than personal accountability.\n\nBut this last event, that happened in December, was bad. The things that happened after it were also bad. Talking to the police was bad (and ineffective). The person who did this is still doing it to other people and that\u2019s bad. They\u2019re in my town and that\u2019s bad. I\u2019m so terrified of running into them. I check doors and parking lots constantly and obsessively. I know that\u2019s not normal but it\u2019s better than having to see them.\n\nOn top of that I\u2019m not sleeping or eating. I can\u2019t fall asleep at night, even after 1-2 doses of light sleeping meds. The most I can manage is four or five cumulative hours per night (max). Food doesn\u2019t taste good anymore. I have to force my self to eat, but it\u2019s sometimes easier to just let myself be hungry because with my intense workout schedule, I\u2019m hoping it will just make me tired enough to sleep at night if that makes sense. Yesterday I tried boxing without headgear + weak defense to see if getting hit hard enough would help me sleep.\n\nAnd when I DO sleep it\u2019s just bad dreams. Not fun.\n\nNo; therapy is not an option currently. My family doesn\u2019t know my PTSD is this bad but it\u2019s much better if they don\u2019t (it will get tense, lots of explosive fighting, etc). \n\nI\u2019m worried because last night, at boxing practice, I think everyone noticed something was wrong. Or at least a lot of people. They said I looked really tired and like something was off. It\u2019s a small, close group too. One guy talked to me after everyone left, and said if something\u2019s going on I can talk to them.\n\nI felt horrible because I didn\u2019t know what to say. In my experience, people don\u2019t genuinely care unless they get something out of it. Generally they just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want them to treat me differently if they find out what I\u2019ve gone through and what I\u2019m dealing with mentally. They\u2019re the only group of people that treats me with respect, and that\u2019s the only place I feel like my hard work is validated. I don\u2019t want that dampened with pity. And that\u2019s assuming they\u2019d want to be involved in this at all...\n\nI\u2019m a mess; I\u2019m sorry. This post turned into something it wasn\u2019t intended to at all. This is how my brain is currently working and I can\u2019t fix it. Or the food or insomnia.

Any comment from you guys will be very appreciated! \n\nSo I recently broke up with my girlfriend over a big fight. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had a fight like this and every-time we get into an argument she tends to get very defensive and start attacking me. She gets into this rage of cursing me out loud regardless of where we are or who we are with and goes on for 30 minutes. In the beginning of the relationship, I thought this to be more nothing more than anger management and her personality. She tends to be very aggressive with her words and starts attacking the other person when she feels like she gets taken advantage of. There are a few restaurants that Im still ashamed to go because my ex and I caused a very unpleasant scene. I mean everyone gets like that when they get mad but it was way too extreme. She had so much hatred and negativity against certain type of people and would even mention of hurting the others at extreme.\n\nAfter the breakup, I had some time to catch up with a friend. We were just having a couple of drinks just chatting and the word \u201cPTSD\u201d was brought up. And this word instantly hit me so hard... I mean folks I never experienced it and never thought I would meet anyone who had it. But deep inside me I knew my ex was going through PTSD. \n\nOne of the symptoms she had was nightmare. She never shared her nightmare with me except for once and I never insisted on her telling me since it always put her in a bad mood. But that time she told me, it\u2019s someone trying to attack her and she cant seem to do anything about it..... The other physical symptoms she had (at least thats what I think) were her migraines. She was very sensitive to noises. She would scream in th middle of the night and scared the shit out of me. She also would jerk her leg at night saying it hurts and would not be able to go to sleep. She told me she has a bad memory. All of this indicate that she has PTSD but I was oblivious to the symptoms.  Now that I have learned this, I only have regrets of not being more understanding and guiding her in th right direction. Although I have to admit that I was very exhausted from this relationship I cant deny the fact that I still love her and care for her.    Im willing to put myself in her shoes even if that means I take away just a little of the pain she goes through.\n\nFolks, I would love to hear some of you guys go through. Obviously talking about symptoms is not pleasant but if anyone is willing to share what they have to go through it will be much appreciated.\n\nThanks", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 324, "end": 1158, "span": "It wasn\u2019t the first time we had a fight like this and every-time we get into an argument she tends to get very defensive and start attacking me.
