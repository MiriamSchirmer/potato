I thought one of them was gonna get killed.And if they r fighting downstairs I can hear them hitting each other if it\u2019s physical or if they r going at each other or push each other and it makes a loud noise, like a bang on the ground or something.\nBut the things I\u2019m experiencing (the after effects) they don\u2019t know about...\nLet me explain.\nSo I have bad anxiety(I haven\u2019t rly been diagnosed with it but my mom know I have it and it\u2019s rly bad to the point where I have anxiety attacks) but I always get triggered when I hear a big stomp upstairs, I always think it\u2019s them fighting again and I get rly scared, but when I go up it\u2019s just my siblings playing around,and I have to try and clap down.\n(Loud bangs,slap sounds ,yells,other noises)scare me anxiety kicks in right away. Also sometimes I wake up and I think they are fighting again but I go down and they are sleeping and it\u2019s just the tv,but it sounded like they are fighting.so I Can\u2019t rly go back to sleep easy. Or if they are talking loud r sometimes just talking Normally and I\u2019m upstairs in my room it\u2019s sound like they are arguing and my anxiety get triggered and I feel like I want to cry,even when my mom is talking on the phone she kinda talks loud a lot bc I think she is losing hearing a little,so she talks a little louder than needed and it triggers me bc I keep thinking I hear them arguing but it\u2019s just them talking normally.\nI have watched this YouTube video and there where parents arguing in it and I immediately started crying bc it gave me some kinda flash back ig and it sounded exactly like there fighting. Sometimes I can\u2019t sleep especially when they argue. And when I\u2019m class the topic of abuse or any kind of toxic family topic come up I have to leave the class and clam down. It also doesn\u2019t help that my neighbour has bad anxiety and screams at night sometimes and I wake up rly scared bc I think my they are fighting. I don\u2019t know exactly what to call it bc I don\u2019t want to diagnose my self but I think it could be ptsd and yes it trauma I have gone through other things in my life as in seeing someone get stabbed but I don\u2019t worry about those as much because I can\u2019t remember them as much as what I am going threw rn... if u read this that is my story and thanks for taking the time to see what\u2019s happening this is my first time posting on here pls don\u2019t judge me &lt;3"}, "2579_counseling": {"id": "2579_counseling", "text": "After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex?

The things that happened after it were also bad. Talking to the police was bad (and ineffective). The person who did this is still doing it to other people and that\u2019s bad. They\u2019re in my town and that\u2019s bad. I\u2019m so terrified of running into them. I check doors and parking lots constantly and obsessively. I know that\u2019s not normal but it\u2019s better than having to see them.\n\nOn top of that I\u2019m not sleeping or eating. I can\u2019t fall asleep at night, even after 1-2 doses of light sleeping meds. The most I can manage is four or five cumulative hours per night (max). Food doesn\u2019t taste good anymore. I have to force my self to eat, but it\u2019s sometimes easier to just let myself be hungry because with my intense workout schedule, I\u2019m hoping it will just make me tired enough to sleep at night if that makes sense.

My family doesn\u2019t know my PTSD is this bad but it\u2019s much better if they don\u2019t (it will get tense, lots of explosive fighting, etc). \n\nI\u2019m worried because last night, at boxing practice, I think everyone noticed something was wrong. Or at least a lot of people. They said I looked really tired and like something was off. It\u2019s a small, close group too. One guy talked to me after everyone left, and said if something\u2019s going on I can talk to them.\n\nI felt horrible because I didn\u2019t know what to say. In my experience, people don\u2019t genuinely care unless they get something out of it. Generally they just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want them to treat me differently if they find out what I\u2019ve gone through and what I\u2019m dealing with mentally. They\u2019re the only group of people that treats me with respect, and that\u2019s the only place I feel like my hard work is validated. I don\u2019t want that dampened with pity.

The things that happened after it were also bad. Talking to the police was bad (and ineffective). The person who did this is still doing it to other people and that\u2019s bad. They\u2019re in my town and that\u2019s bad. I\u2019m so terrified of running into them. I check doors and parking lots constantly and obsessively. I know that\u2019s not normal but it\u2019s better than having to see them.\n\nOn top of that I\u2019m not sleeping or eating. I can\u2019t fall asleep at night, even after 1-2 doses of light sleeping meds. The most I can manage is four or five cumulative hours per night (max). Food doesn\u2019t taste good anymore. I have to force my self to eat, but it\u2019s sometimes easier to just let myself be hungry because with my intense workout schedule, I\u2019m hoping it will just make me tired enough to sleep at night if that makes sense. Yesterday I tried boxing without headgear + weak defense to see if getting hit hard enough would help me sleep.\n\nAnd when I DO sleep it\u2019s just bad dreams. Not fun.\n\nNo; therapy is not an option currently. My family doesn\u2019t know my PTSD is this bad but it\u2019s much better if they don\u2019t (it will get tense, lots of explosive fighting, etc). \n\nI\u2019m worried because last night, at boxing practice, I think everyone noticed something was wrong. Or at least a lot of people. They said I looked really tired and like something was off. It\u2019s a small, close group too. One guy talked to me after everyone left, and said if something\u2019s going on I can talk to them.\n\nI felt horrible because I didn\u2019t know what to say. In my experience, people don\u2019t genuinely care unless they get something out of it. Generally they just don\u2019t.
