Counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist.  There is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences, where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help.  That said, clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover, or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future. . . what they are able to pay for out of pocket.  That first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture, but it doesn't have to stay that way.  Counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients, and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way.  The counselor you select should be compassionate, caring, able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns, and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth. Once you have found a counselor you want to work with, you would then schedule an appointment to meet.  That first session is often very low key.  There might be some forms for you to complete, which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you.  The counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement.  This document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor's credentials; practice rules; forms of payment; office hours; emergency contact details; and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law, among other details.  All of this benefits you as the client, so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor. In the first session, it is absolutely okay to be nervous.  Here's a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): Counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client, as the client is to meet their new counselor.

Now I'm realizing I want to be more open, but I thought the Internet is a good place to start. Part of my issue with sharing is that I can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although I logically know that of course people have. \n\nThis story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile:\n\nWell I began being groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17. I was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so I was the perfect target  At age 18 he started with the sexual advances and I was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. \n\nHe was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was I ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. His wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and I had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. \n\nAnd meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). \n\nIn the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.\n\nThere were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.\n\n While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. \n\nThis man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. I never got to complete my university degree because I was trapped under him when I should have been there. Also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now I have several quite severe chronic health conditions.\n\n I completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. Because I can't work, I can't afford proper health care or therapy. I have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and I don't think I'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. \n\nI don't live with a victim mentality but I think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me.\n\nThank you for reading my account because I need to get it out.", "displayed_text": "Want to Share a bit of my Story (TW: sexual abuse) So right now I'm going through a formal process of bringing ti light some sexual harassment I've suffered, and it's triggered me badly regarding the sexual abuse I endured as a very young adult. I have rarely spoken about it since it happened. I was disssauded from being public about it, and I now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. \n\nBecause being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem.
