So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. \n*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. \n*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.\n*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.\n*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. \n*I was in a \"relationship\" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).\n*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. \n\nAll of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.\n\nI want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old. I want a chance to be 5 again. But I don't want to die.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n"}, "341_ptsd": {"id": "341_ptsd", "text": "I got shot at today I\u2019m not sure if this is the right place for this or not so feel free to remove but I just need to say this.

Because every choice has a cost, and that cost is pain. Sometimes trying hurts more. Sometimes giving up hurts more. But it always hurts to know that there's no sense or order to it at all. No matter what I choose, it will hurt. I'll be more tired tomorrow than I was today, it will be more difficult the day after that. So why 'keep trying'? It's a question I have to 'keep trying' to answer, isn't it? Because trying or giving up is not ultimately a question of survival, but of sacrifice. \n\nSuffering is worst when it is meaningless. A man can absorb a universe of pain for a noble purpose, but a prick of senseless suffering can bring him to his knees. At least it's true for me. Perhaps it's an inherent weakness. Perhaps it's a failure of character. Does it matter? I suspect it might have, once, but now that pain has scoured so much of me away I have my doubts. What difference would it make if I was alive or dead? \n\nOf course, the truth is, death would be an immeasurable improvement for me. But in the depths of my soul I know that my life has never been about me. In fact, that barest shred of self-forgetfulness, of selflessness, is the only thing keeping me alive. I wish it was because I was primarily motivated by my care for others, of how devastating my selfish death would be to them, but I suspect it's not. Brutally and truthfully, to deny the reality of my derivative and dependent existence would be to obliterate the last anchor-hold of meaning to life at all. There's little sense in wading through the philosophical underpinnings of the conviction, but there it is all the same. If life is about me, it must be meaningless. If life has never been about me, it is because an objective purpose exists that, by its weight and significance, orients all lives toward itself. \n\nMy pain has banished me into darkness, blinded by suffering to the noonbright hope and meaning that lights my way unseen. But I am not the gravest thing in my universe; hope has far more gravity than I, and my world is trapped in its orbit, however much I stumble and crawl in my blindness. \n\nI wonder if anyone knows how it feels to feel life screaming at you to GIVE UP at every turn. Every voice. Every person. Every interaction. Every hurt. Every pleasure. Every failure. Every season. Give up. \n\nDemons can give voice to things, you know. Quiet, innocuous things take on a beastly aspect. Snarling, sniveling, malicious, monstrous lies, though obvious for their fiendish nature, can be bound up in so much rage and sinew that their roar drowns out their foulness. Familiarity is, after all, just another form of blindness. A man can see a lie for what it is the first time he sees it. 'Give up.' He recoils in disgust at the squirming, grimy thing, and wishes that someone would stamp it out. But if all his world becomes crowded with lies, if they squeeze out of holes in the ground and pile up, growing larger, feeding on pain and fear, until they blot out the son and tower over him with claws and horns, smiling wickedly--well, he must go on about his business. Everyone expects him to, anyway. Perhaps the devils aren't really there. No one else seems to notice them, anyway. But try as he might, he cannot ignore them forever. They fade into the background. They become part of his world, part of the canvas instead of the painting. Nuisances long ignored become companions in time. But the screaming. Oh, the howling of hell that can be heard so loud by the soul of one man yet be silent to all others. The loneliness of it all is enough to drive a person mad. \n\nYou're not supposed to give credit to devils, after all. Focus on the positive, they say. It's not the darkness but the light that will triumph, in the end, so is it not as if the darkness was never there at all? It has no power to drive out or drive back its nemesis; so hope, dear boy! Carry your light and live not in fear of the legions that assail you day and night, but especially the night. \n\nBut they never tell you how naked you are in your dreams. How I wish that angels would visit me instead of demons. Words can't describe what it's like to have nightmares for four years straight. Devils can make you dream about anything they like. Frightful nights once in a long while can only trouble young children. But when demons invade the solace of sleep, it's like your enemy taking up residence in your home. They just wait for you to come home; you can't stay away forever. You can't stay awake forever. There's no refuge from that kind of torment. The more your sleep suffers, the more you need it, the more you suffer. I never expected to understand so well why people kill themselves.", "displayed_text": "Just shouting into the void Do you know what it's like for someone to ask about your summer plans, and for your first thought to be, 'I don't even know if I'll be alive by summer.'?\n\nDo you know what it's like for all the noise in the world to boil down to just two voices? And nothing terrifies you more than wondering how long it will take for there to just be one voice left? \n\nEverything in my world, every person, every event, every action, every idea, every desire, can only say one of two things: 'Give up,' or 'Keep trying'. Problem is, it's harder and harder to hear hope. Every decision I make it either to give up or keep trying. Every single one. It's not a decision of whether to go to work or stay home; it's a question of whether I'm giving up today. I never have to decide whether I'm going to do the laundry or not; I have to choose whether to keep trying or not. \n\nOf course, it's not quite that simple, is it? Because every choice has a cost, and that cost is pain. Sometimes trying hurts more. Sometimes giving up hurts more. But it always hurts to know that there's no sense or order to it at all.
