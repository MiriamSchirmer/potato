I've been reflecting on the events of 2017, what with it being the new year and all, and I just wanted to share a little of my happiness with everyone. \n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD a few years back because of extended trauma going back from elementary school all the way through to college. When I was diagnosed, I had actually sought out therapy for depression but due to some conversations with friends and the things I was currently studying in my Stress and Trauma class (I was a psych major) I realized that I fit almost every symptom listed for the PTSD diagnosis as well. \n\nI had been receiving therapy through my university's health program which allowed for a certain number of free visits every semester. But then my therapist left the university clinic and went into private practice. I continued to see her, but I couldn't afford the insurance copay and eventually stopped my visits altogether. On paper the fees were reasonable, but all my financial info was based on the fact that I was technically still considered my mom's dependent. In reality, she only paid for my insurance and I was living in poverty while trying to go to school because I was receiving pretty much no help from my family and couldn't find work. \n\nFrom then until just a few months ago, I wasn't receiving any treatment for my mental health issues. Last year was rather hellish for me. I was in a much better situation financially, I lived in a better apartment, had a job, and in a lot of other ways my life was objectively better. But emotionally, I was suffering. It hadn't been that bad for me since I had escaped the awful home life that traumatized me in the first place.\n\nIt took a lot of mental energy in a time where I didn't have much, but at my lowest point I finally researched therapy offices in my area. I got married two years ago and my partner's insurance covers most of the cost. Plus, we're fortunate enough that I can afford it without having to worry about still being able to eat afterwards, unlike when I was in college. So I called and made an appointment. \n\nThat was back in October. I'm now going through CPT (cognitive processing therapy). It's really fucking hard, but so far it has absolutely been worth it. I'm putting a lot more time and effort into improving myself. I've been much more productive. I'm doing things I used to love again. Things that used to seem a distant dream or completely unachievable now feel like they might be things I can tackle - if not now, then *someday*. I'm more hopeful than I've probably ever been. My partner has been unbelievably supportive and has said they're really proud of me for all the work I've been doing. \n\nI'm not quite there, yet. It's still a struggle. But I'm making it. I feel like I can do this. And I hope that all of you reading this can claim some happiness for yourselves, too. \n\nMuch love ~\n\nTL;DR: I have gone untreated for over three years and just got back into therapy a few months ago.

I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.

I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.\nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol.

I pretty much blanked on much of my early life before going to school; my elementary years were marked by extreme fear and neuroticism; from junior high on I was numb and depressed. Understanding my father now as a pedophile, narcissist, and abuser has been the missing key to explaining so much about my life. Now I\u2019m trying to recondition my behavior to be adaptive instead of maladaptive, which means piecing together the origins of my fears and anxieties.\n\nAs a child, I hated dolls and sought the comfort of stuffed animals instead. As an adult with overt PTSD, I notice I have a heavy preference for non-human animal company. I struggle with some misanthropy. Was my doll phobia related to the sexual abuse? Did I see myself as a doll in some way? I was super triggered by the movie The Exorcist, and as an adult, I see so many commonalities with child sexual abuse.\n\nI also had a phobia of mirrors. Whenever I would brush my teeth, I was terrified that when I looked down to spit and looked back up, my face would be different, or someone would be behind me. As an adult, I realize I never had a stable sense of self. My existence was always conditional (on appeasing my abuser). And I wasn\u2019t allowed to have my own will, not when it conflicted with his. As I\u2019ve become more comfortable with myself, mirrors scare me less.

I lost seven teeth, crushed the right side of my face and broke my left humerus. While it's not ideal, I've accepted this moment in my life and the results of it.

For the past year I've been going to a rock climbing gym and the dreams have largely stopped. I still avoid ladders and other heights, but I'm comfortable on the rock wall. I'm not as daring as others there, and it really limits the difficulty of climbs I can complete because I don't put myself out there as much as I could to make the more difficult moves. Sometimes I fall, but it's generally expected. Or I jump off because I'm worn out. \n\nToday I had an unexpected fall. It was only from about 7ft, but my foot slipped, just like it did in my accident. I hit the ground awkwardly, but unhurt and didn't stop shaking for an hour. I was on the verge of tears as I left the gym and bought a pack of cigarettes (I've been on an ecig for a few months). To top it off, I had to go in for a work meeting where the manager tore into us for the general decline in standards that's occurred lately, which is a whole other story.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm still on edge, and I don't want to sleep because I know I'll have a dream where I fall, or I lose my teeth, or crush my face or something. I was doing so well, and I know it's just a bad day, but I'm terrified that this step back will have more of an impact. I just need someone who's been here before to tell me something that helps.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 60, "end": 361, "span": "My back story is thst in 2015 I fell during a free solo rock climb in the Ozark Mountains.

I went to jail when I was 15 for no reason got out in a little over a week after being in max and a lower security sector once they realised I was innocent. Apparently I was their for investigation. I do not care to share details. But I am in america where we are told we are innocent until proven guilty. I learned the opposite is true.\n\n I am now 20 and freak out when i see cop cars and I often have dreams of the police arresting and my friends taking me or us to jail or raiding my house. I even hate hearing the sirens in songs and i especially hate seeing a combo of red and blue lights. I often wake up from those dreams completely out of breath and sometimes crying and very scared until I realized it was a dream. This is all embarrassing for me. \n\nDo people with ptsd have these similar experiences or am I over reacting to having night mares slightly often? Maybe everyone is afraid of seeing cops? I just would like everyones opinions on if they think I have a problem or not and what kind of professional I should talk to. I am sorry but I know nothing about any of this.

Things have been going good so far. I keep improving and I have days where i actually feel positive.\n\nThe hardest part still, it just like... getting physically active in order to do daily thing. There are still days where I wake up and my body feels like shit (not like how when i had anxiety attacks, just a general kind of shit).
