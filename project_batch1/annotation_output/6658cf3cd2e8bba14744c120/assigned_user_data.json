A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. \nSince then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could\u2019ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I\u2019ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could\u2019ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I\u2019ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don\u2019t really have nightmares.\nI just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it\u2019s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I\u2019ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don\u2019t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I\u2019ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I\u2019ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I\u2019m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I\u2019ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I\u2019m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn\u2019t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn\u2019t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he\u2019s made it clear before that he doesn\u2019t generally prescribe benzodiazepines.

A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. \nSince then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could\u2019ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I\u2019ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could\u2019ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I\u2019ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don\u2019t really have nightmares.\nI just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it\u2019s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I\u2019ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don\u2019t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I\u2019ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I\u2019ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I\u2019m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I\u2019ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I\u2019m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn\u2019t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn\u2019t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he\u2019s made it clear before that he doesn\u2019t generally prescribe benzodiazepines. What are my options? I desperately need advice. Sorry for the long and badly structured rant by the way."}, "316_ptsd": {"id": "316_ptsd", "text": "How has your support system been able to help you?

It simply refuses to do that and/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers"}, "453_counseling": {"id": "453_counseling", "text": "My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed.
