When I was in middle school, I was bullied a lot. Physically. I've been assaulted a few times from women when I was a teenager. I remember in 5th grade I got off the bus and two women jumped me, broke my nose and left me bloody.. a few months later another woman assaulted me at school, and would throw me against the locker(she was much older than me). I also got in multiple fights with people and I saw some fucked up shit like a cat getting ripped to shreds by my own dog.. After that I would see dead animals on the side of the road and break down in tears. I was a bully in school too. always built with rage. One time a kid jumped on my back and bit my shoulder and In response I body slammed him on the concrete because he freaked me out. I put him in the hospital and his dad threatened to kill me (I was 13, He was in his 40's). I was going to be charged with assault even though I was defending myself unless I wrote my bully a letter saying that I'm sorry. The reason I was in the wrong is because I'm a huge dude and he was half my size. It was fucking stupid. I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive. I left town when I was 18 and moved to Seattle, got a job at McDonald's and started therapy. I had a suicide attempt that same year and that put me in the hospital for a few weeks. I left my job at McDonald's a few weeks later, got a job at amazon and started making something of myself. But I struggle around people, I always have.

I've been assaulted a few times from women when I was a teenager. I remember in 5th grade I got off the bus and two women jumped me, broke my nose and left me bloody.. a few months later another woman assaulted me at school, and would throw me against the locker(she was much older than me). I also got in multiple fights with people and I saw some fucked up shit like a cat getting ripped to shreds by my own dog.. After that I would see dead animals on the side of the road and break down in tears. I was a bully in school too. always built with rage. One time a kid jumped on my back and bit my shoulder and In response I body slammed him on the concrete because he freaked me out. I put him in the hospital and his dad threatened to kill me (I was 13, He was in his 40's). I was going to be charged with assault even though I was defending myself unless I wrote my bully a letter saying that I'm sorry. The reason I was in the wrong is because I'm a huge dude and he was half my size. It was fucking stupid. I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive.

It was just my life, I have no other perspective or anything I can compare it to.  I'm more writing this out to just to get it out so... Here we go\n\nMy first memory of my father was when I was 2 to 4, my mom was leaving for work, he was hungover I'm assuming and I was crying staring out the window because she was leaving me, I didn't stop after she left, I remember my dad had his hand on his face not looking well, barley attempting to calm me down when he grabbed my pj shirt and slapped me across the face, the memory ends there.

And when\r\nwe add it to an apology, we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light\r\nas it is. Of course, sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone\r\nis offered. So be it, we can\u2019t control this. But if we are apologizing to\r\nourselves, we can. There is always a way to make amends if we put our heart\r\ninto it.\nGive this a try the next time you\u2019re reluctant to let yourself off\r\nthe hook.

Those\r\ntwo demons start out as pesky and little when we are young, then grow with us to\r\nbecome quite formidable. I'd like to throw in a technique I learned from Randy\r\nRausch (author of\u00a0The Last Lecture)\u00a0called The 3-Step Apology.\r\nI teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize\r\nto someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselves.Yes, when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget\r\nthat there is part of us that just doesn't know how to apologize effectively.\r\nHere goes:Step One: Say what you did and the damage it caused.Step Two: Say you're sorry and accept full\r\nresponsibility (no excuses, no explanation, no defensiveness: \u201cIt was all my\r\nfault.\u201d)Step\r\nThree: Ask what you can do to repair the damage.Step Three is the one many of us didn\u2019t learn growing up. And when\r\nwe add it to an apology, we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light\r\nas it is. Of course, sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone\r\nis offered. So be it, we can\u2019t control this. But if we are apologizing to\r\nourselves, we can.
