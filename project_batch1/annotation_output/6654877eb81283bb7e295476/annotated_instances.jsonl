The abuse (molested) started in preschool and didn\u2019t stop until December 2015 or 2016. \n\nIn addition to being a CSA survivor, I lost my mom May 30th, 2019. She had multiple health issues before my brother and I were born and got worse over the last 10 years. For reference my brother was born in July 1998 and I was born in February 2000. Anyways, I had a dream I watched her die of a heart attack and sure enough 3 days later she died, most likely of a heart attack. My dad and I had gone to the store and when we got back she was face down on the floor, next to her bed. We had only been out for 40-50 minutes. I had my brother call 911 while I took our dogs in my room so the paramedics could do their thing. I knew she was gone soon as I saw her body. After I don\u2019t know how much time passed she was declared dead. I still had to stay with the dogs because of the medical examiners and funeral home people, so after some more time passed we shut the door to my parents room so I could talk with our pastor and cry with my family. Soon as I saw the foot of the body bag I walked to my room with my back turned to it. I didn\u2019t want to see her get rolled out... but just when I thought the funeral people had already taken her outside, I turned around. It was a mistake. I saw her face in the body bag as they rolled her out and no matter how much everything told me to look away, I couldn\u2019t. \n\nEver since then I\u2019ve had countless dreams where I see her die, see my friends go missing and/or end up dead, and see my dad die. I also experience flashbacks that replay the scene of the night she died. I also have flashbacks to when I was molested even though it\u2019s been almost 3 years since it stopped.

Help Long story, but read if you can. \n\nI came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. \n\nAbout a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. \n\nLots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. \n\nThe day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear \"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said \"one sec\" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. \n\nDuring this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. \n\nSince I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. \n\nIt got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. \n\nDo I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. \n\nI miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself.

I remember in 5th grade I got off the bus and two women jumped me, broke my nose and left me bloody.. a few months later another woman assaulted me at school, and would throw me against the locker(she was much older than me). I also got in multiple fights with people and I saw some fucked up shit like a cat getting ripped to shreds by my own dog.. After that I would see dead animals on the side of the road and break down in tears. I was a bully in school too. always built with rage. One time a kid jumped on my back and bit my shoulder and In response I body slammed him on the concrete because he freaked me out. I put him in the hospital and his dad threatened to kill me (I was 13, He was in his 40's). I was going to be charged with assault even though I was defending myself unless I wrote my bully a letter saying that I'm sorry. The reason I was in the wrong is because I'm a huge dude and he was half my size. It was fucking stupid. I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive. I left town when I was 18 and moved to Seattle, got a job at McDonald's and started therapy. I had a suicide attempt that same year and that put me in the hospital for a few weeks. I left my job at McDonald's a few weeks later, got a job at amazon and started making something of myself. But I struggle around people, I always have. My coping mechanism is painting, I'm an artist outside of work and it's something I care deeply about. I'm thinking of leaving Amazon to become an artist because that's what I want to do. I don't care if it's hard, I've had a lifetime of hardship so I know what hard is. Anyways this is more of a rant than an explanation. I had a very abusive childhood and it's made me have thick skin, It's why I am the man I am..

I have nightmares sometimes, and panic attacks pretty often, but I also started passing out and \u2018losing time\u2019 and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related to PTSD or if it\u2019s a different thing, so I\u2019m wondering if anyone here has had any related symptoms. I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post it, but honestly you guys seem like a good community (this is more or less a throwaway, but I\u2019ve been lurking for a while on another account). And I know that it says no medical advice, and I don\u2019t know if this would really fall into it- I\u2019m seeing a doctor regularly, and I don\u2019t want advice about what to do more than just wanting to know if this is something other people experience. Anyways, when I black out it doesn\u2019t feel at all like a panic attack, my vision goes dark while when I have a panic attack my vision goes bright and everything looks white. Also, during panic attacks I feel over sensitive/ every sense seems alarmingly heightened, but when I pass out it just feels like I completely lose control, everything goes black and I can feel myself falling and then I wake up. Ive checked with my doctor to see if it could be caused by heart problems as they run in the family, but all results came back completely normal. Honestly I didn\u2019t even think of it being related to PTSD until a friend suggested it. Along with passing out, there has also been days where I look at the time and realize that somehow four or five hours passed by without me recalling any of it. I don\u2019t use any substances, and honestly it\u2019s a fairly scary experience and I don\u2019t know if any of you have felt anything like that that ended up being related to PTSD.

For reference, I (21F) developed severe anxiety and depression when I was 19 (which also had some C-PTSD mixed in from being ostracized at school for years growing up), got put on the wrong drugs that made me suicidal, and was sent to a Christian inpatient mental health facility for seven weeks.

She's about 2 years older than me, and we were always very nerdy, we would play as star trek characters or something and run around outside, sometimes we'd play as Mario characters. I was the younger sibling so I'd always get stuck playing the boy bc sis wanted to play as a girl. Eventually the Mario playing turned sexual, but here's the thing, we never actually touched each other, it would always be one of us just sitting on the other and stuff like that. It's very rare for me to remember things that happened to me when I was a child because of how badly I was bullied and beaten in school. (A kid damaged my eye so badly that my vision is damaged for life and I have to wear glasses.) This leads me to believe u have ptsd because I block out like all of school from my memories. Anyway, the events with sis went on until I was probably 12 or 13, her being 14-16. I'm 16 now and I can't imagine thinking its acceptable to play with a kid in that way. To describe it better it basically turned into roleplaying. We would act out sex with the motions and sounds but never actually do more than grind basically. Can someone please help? Should I get therapy? Was it rape? Would this contribute if I did have trauma and now developed ptsd?
