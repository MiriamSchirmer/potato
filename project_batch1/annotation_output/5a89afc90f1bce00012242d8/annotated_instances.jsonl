If I was mad at someone, even for the slightest smallest \"infractions\" towards me, I would fantasize about hurting them in some way.

{"id": "375_ptsd", "displayed_text": "First flashback in awhile today This is my first post here. My back story is thst in 2015 I fell during a free solo rock climb in the Ozark Mountains. I fell from approximately 50 ft and was kept alive by my two best friends until I was loaded into a helicopter five hours later. I lost seven teeth, crushed the right side of my face and broke my left humerus. While it's not ideal, I've accepted this moment in my life and the results of it. In a roundabout way, it's lead to one of my best friends meeting his now-fiancee and put me on a positive direction in life as opposed to bouncing around from job to job.\n\nOver the past couple of years I dealt with roughly one dream a week reliving the experience and waking up in a panic. For the past year I've been going to a rock climbing gym and the dreams have largely stopped. I still avoid ladders and other heights, but I'm comfortable on the rock wall. I'm not as daring as others there, and it really limits the difficulty of climbs I can complete because I don't put myself out there as much as I could to make the more difficult moves. Sometimes I fall, but it's generally expected. Or I jump off because I'm worn out. \n\nToday I had an unexpected fall. It was only from about 7ft, but my foot slipped, just like it did in my accident. I hit the ground awkwardly, but unhurt and didn't stop shaking for an hour. I was on the verge of tears as I left the gym and bought a pack of cigarettes (I've been on an ecig for a few months). To top it off, I had to go in for a work meeting where the manager tore into us for the general decline in standards that's occurred lately, which is a whole other story.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm still on edge, and I don't want to sleep because I know I'll have a dream where I fall, or I lose my teeth, or crush my face or something. I was doing so well, and I know it's just a bad day, but I'm terrified that this step back will have more of an impact.

We felt like having a little bit of fun, but only took one tab each so that I could still drive and we could just cruise around all night tripping. So skip ahead some time and at this point it was around 3am. We were driving on some back roads in a country area. We felt this was a good place to stay because it wasn't populated and no one else was on the road. There was also no police that came by this area usually. We took a turn on a road and started heading down it. This was a road we haven't been on before. It was very dark, no street lights. When we turn a corner I see blinking lights from a car and then I see that the car was smashed into a tree. I was tripping balls at this point, but I felt I couldn't not go and see if anyone was hurt or not. I pull up behind the car and my girlfriend begs me to not go. She is tripping harder then me and thinks that I am going to be attacked or something and I was going to get killed. I calmed her and just reassured her I was going to check and I'll run back to the car if anything happens and to leave it on. I walk up to the car and I can smell gasoline and burnt rubber. My heart starts to beat fast as I approach the door. When I open the door I instantly felt sick. Already tripping the sight I had to just behold almost had me at my breaking point I tried not to cry. There was a mother and her daughter in the front seat. The mothers head was bashed in part of her skull had con caved into the rest of her head and there was blood dripping all over. There was a strong metallic smell. I immediately went over to the daughter to see if she was still breathing and to my horror when I checked her pulse there was none. I felt like I couldn't hold myself together. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. I began to break down and I could only say that there had been a crash on the road that we were on and I hung up and took off. By my reaction my girlfriend already knew what must have happened. What haunts me the most is that the car must have been sitting there for a long time. Just sat there maybe the girl was still alive for awhile and no one was there to help her. Maybe if someone had seen it earlier she would've lived. By the way that the blood was coagulated when I came it must have been there for at least an hour.
