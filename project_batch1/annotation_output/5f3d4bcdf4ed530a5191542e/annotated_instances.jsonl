{"id": "1572_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Has anyone's appetite actually increased after PTSD? TW: ED I had an eating disorder as a teenager that ran until I was around 21. It went from restricting myself at 14 to only eating \\~1000 calories a day to binging and purging weekly for the next 8 years. 6 months before my trauma, I decided to end it. I started eating more and healthier and lifting weights instead of the \\~80 minutes of cardio a day I was doing. I felt amazing.\n\nThen the trauma happened, and fitness was one of the interests I lost when the depression and PTSD hit. I couldn't sleep and had a very busy schedule, so I relied on (mainly junk) food to get me through all-nighters and long shifts. This turned to a comfort thing where I would down Ben and Jerry's and blame my depression. I couldn't even go back to doing cardio because an elevated heart-rate felt like a panic attack. Unsurprisingly, I gained 15 pounds, which is a lot on my 5'1 body.\n\nIt's been a year and some months, and I'm safe again. I have my degree, a job, my own apartment, and stability. Yet all I want to do is lose this weight I gained. I associate it with the worst year of my life and everything in me wants to just go back to the \"old me\" before the trauma and, in hand, the weight gain. Yet I'm so scared this restriction is going to lead to my eating becoming disordered again.\n\nI have tried dieting, but I can't get myself to use calorie tracking apps and when I get too hungry I just...eat. I don't think about my allotted macros for the day or if I'm above or below my protein goal or if the food I'm eating \"fits in my macros\" anymore. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating with no restrictions and I still have my daily fruits and veggies. I'm also still very into weight-lifting and go to the gym 6 days a week still. I guess I just don't have the passion to diet and exercise like I used to for weight loss, though.\n\nI hear all the time about people with PTSD not eating and withering away because of the traumatic event they had to endure. Has anybody else experienced the opposite, though- relying on food to cope? It's hard for me to relate to most stories about PTSD because so many talk about experiencing nausea and an inability to eat - but the only thing I cared about after my trauma was eating. Maybe my history of heavy restriction caused my appetite increase after the trauma as a way of preventing myself from going down that path again.

But I can no longer afford medication or therapy so I\u2019ve been skating by basically.\n\nAs a kid, my family gaslighted me into thinking I was a walking disaster.

I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;\n\n2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"new version\" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the \"original\" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a \"substitute\" memory in place of the other one?
