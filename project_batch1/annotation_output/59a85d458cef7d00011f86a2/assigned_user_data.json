Hello,  \n\nI\u2019m a 25 year old woman that turns 26 in exactly two weeks, and I couldn\u2019t fathom being anymore depressed than I am now. When I was 14 and a new sophomore in high school , I met this 22 year old man (I\u2019ll call him The Man) via my friend who was 14 as well. At the time I didn\u2019t know how old he was and he and my friend\u2019s sister (16) were dating. Somehow, the man got my phone number and consistently and persistently texted me until I stopped ignoring him and began texting back. \n\nI didn\u2019t like him at first, but after weeks of texting nonstop, my 14 year old self somehow fell for him. I knew he was involved with my friend\u2019s sister, and it ate me alive, but I also had feelings for him. One day, when my mom wasn\u2019t home, I invited him over for the first time. We met at my neighborhood pool, and we sat in his car and talked in person for about an hour. When it was time for me to leave, he wrestled with me for about 10 mins trying to kiss me, and when I finally submitted, the only thing I could say was that his breath smelled. He left, and we continued to text. \n\nA week later, my friend\u2019s sister (who was in my orchestra class) gave me a note basically cursing me out for \u201ckissing her man\u201d and calling me a fat slut, which hurt because although I\u2019m no where near obese, I\u2019ve always struggled with my weight, and she knew that. I crumpled the paper up and threw it at her telling her that he has been persistently pursuing me. It was a big thing and I almost got kicked out of class. I was really hurt, but I knew I was wrong. I texted him and asked him why he told her, and he said he didn\u2019t want to keep a secret from her, and that he couldn\u2019t see me anymore. I was extremely hurt and didn\u2019t really understand what had happened. He began to ignore me, but would sometimes call me and leave messages about how sorry he was. This all took place around this time this year, the fall. \n\nI fell into a depression, being that this was my first romantic encounter, and it was so negatively toxic, I didn\u2019t know what to think or do. I stopped eating and lost a bunch of weight. Being that I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about this, my family thought I had developed an eating disorder. This lasted a couple months. Then in December, around Christmas break, I started getting prank phone calls. They would call about twice a day, and after about a week, the person came clean and turns out it was The Man.  He told me that he and my friend\u2019s sister ended things because her mom found out about their relationship. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. Elated, I told him I loved him too and agreed to being in a relationship with him. \n\nWhen school started back in January, he would come over after school every Wednesday. My single mom worked a lot, and I took advantage of that. We happily \u201cdated\u201d for exactly a month, until one day, he told me that my friend\u2019s sister wanted him back and wanted to work on their relationship. He also told me that while they were dating, they were sexually involved, something that he was not getting from me. He began breaking up with me saying that she was first. I was distraught. I thought that giving him what she could give him, would make him stay with me. While crying, I told him I would have sex with him. He decided to take me up on that offer. I told him I was scared and asked him if it would hurt and he said it would. He laid me down, and told me to open my legs. I was crying and scared, so he forced them open. I don\u2019t remember it actually happening, but I do remember after it happened, he told me to tell him that he broke me. I told him that he broke me, and he left, not changing his mind about ending things. I cried all night. \n\nHe continued to text me, and see me even while dating the sister. We would have sex, and my attachment to him became really deep, scary deep. About 2 months later, I snuck out in the middle of the night to meet him in my neighborhood and I got caught by the police. The police also found him, but let him go. They brought me home and told my mom. She was livid. She told me that she was pressing charges. She called me a slut and a whore and took my phone. I found a way to contact him and told him what was going on. My mom contacted him and wanted to meet up with him. I don\u2019t know what that meeting looked like or how it went but they met, and afterwards, he told me he couldn\u2019t talk to me anymore, and my mom didn\u2019t press charges. \n\nAbout a year later, I received an email from him saying he missed me. Our secret relationship started up again, but this time it was a bit different. His twin brother was dating this 17 year old girl that I went to school with, so naturally, the girl and I became friends to be each other\u2019s cover. We would all hangout together and one time we all were in the same bed and having sex, but not with each other. I met some of his other siblings and had to lie about my age when they said I looked so young. He would also give me alcohol. There was a time that I went on a weekend trip with him and his brother to visit their friend (24). We stayed at the Friend\u2019s house who was celebrating his girlfriend of 6 years\u2019 birthday. It was a big celebration because she was finally turning 18. The Man had friends like him and even his twin brother was like him. About a week later, I found out that he gave me chlamydia and when I told him about it, and that he was the only guy I\u2019ve ever been with, he denied it and said that I must\u2019ve gotten it from a toilet seat or something. Somehow, my entire high school found out that I had an std. I don\u2019t know how, but I continued to date him. On the same date that he broke up with me the year before, he broke up with me again, stating that I was too young. He still continued to see me and have sex with me, just without the title of being in a relationship with me. This allowed him to see other people, which I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later, my mom found out and this time actually pressed charges. She took me to talk to a detective and I remember hating her for that. I didn\u2019t tell the detective everything but I told him some things and that I loved him. The Man decided to turn himself in and I didn\u2019t talk to him again after that. My mom was extremely mad at me for months. I knew she was disappointed in me, and every chance she got, she let me know. \n\nWhen I started my senior year of high school, things were a lot more normal. My mom was trusting me again, and even got me a car. I had a boyfriend that was my age, that she approved of. One day, at a Friday high school football game, I saw The Man. I was there with my boyfriend and avoided The Man. He stared at me and watched me. When the game ended, he texted me and said that he sees I moved on. I said yeah. \n\nThe case against him was still going on. A few months passed and he contacted me begging me to ask my mom to drop the charges because he was facing 20 years. I told him that I would talk to her. He then asked me to marry him and said that if I marry him, the charges would automatically drop and that he could get us an apartment. He said we could start a family and that he would take care of us. I seriously thought about it, and then declined. I told my mom that he contacted me and she was mad at me. A few months later, I found out that she worked out a deal to bring his sentencing down to him being on probation for 10 years and being on the sex offender\u2019s list for 3 years. \n\nAt the time, my teenage self moved on from the situation very quickly. However when I turned 25 last year, all the memories and emotions I suppressed hit me like a ton of bricks. Ever since I was 16, my body has been sick. I have acne all over my body, irregular periods, mood swings, regular yeast infections and vaginal infections and have had terribly toxic relationships with men. I think that every guy I encounter has given me an STD. For the last two years, and being sexually active once out of those two years, I have been trying to convince myself that I do not have HIV even after testing negatively several times. I\u2019m starting to believe I\u2019m traumatized. \n\n I always feel like I have to please any male I encounter, and that I need to work hard and give him everything I have to avoid him leaving me. I\u2019m overtly sexual and think that I must be a pornstar in order to receive love from the male kind however, I don\u2019t really know what intimacy is. \n\nI don\u2019t have healthy relationships at all. If I befriend a female, after a couple months, I cut her off and stop talking to her. \n\nI have dreams of being a doctor, but now think that I\u2019m incapable of achieving something like that. My confidence is shot, and I hate myself. \n\nI feel guilty for The Man having to spend nearly all of his 20s on probation. I hate myself for being such a fast and loose little girl. I hate what I did to my mom and my sister. \n\nI still live at home, in the same bedroom where all of this took place and it\u2019s starting to swallow me whole. I\u2019ve been having flashbacks of what happened and I hate myself for that.\n\n I don\u2019t know who I am anymore and I\u2019m scared to interact with people or even exist on this planet. Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I\u2019m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don\u2019t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. \n\nIm in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I\u2019ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I\u2019ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can\u2019t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I\u2019ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I\u2019m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I\u2019m always alone and always will be. I\u2019m scared and I don\u2019t know what to do.", "displayed_text": "What is wrong with me? Do I have PTSD?

I am not requesting that. I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent/ramble/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)\n\nI had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. \n\nI've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. \n\nNope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. \n\nAnd then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then \"wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?\" \n\nAnd then the floodgates started to open. \n\n*  \"Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable\"      \n* \"Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep.

Need to start working on writing stuff down for my appointment so I can't conveniently forget to mention it. \n", "displayed_text": "Sudden realization has shook me as a person (note: I know diagnosis posts are not allowed. I am not requesting that. I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent/ramble/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)\n\nI had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. \n\nI've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. \n\nNope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. \n\nAnd then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then \"wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?\" \n\nAnd then the floodgates started to open. \n\n*  \"Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable\"      \n* \"Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.\"      \n* \"I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me.

Everything hits me a bit harder than most people so if you think this is nothing, it may be for you but for me it's hell.\n\nLet's start with last week. I contacted Amazon over a pretty simple request. I'm on disability and didn't receive my cheque for December. I've been scraping by for that month and this by dumpster diving and panhandling. Merry Christmas to me I guess. At any rate, I contacted Amazon customer service with an off hand request. I had gotten a Prime trial and asked them if they could extend it for a month for free. I explained the situation. Didn't expect anything from it at all, but the reaction I got was weird. The person I was chatting to on their website started asking for order numbers. I said nevermind and ended the chat. 13 hours later he emails me to say he didn't understand what I was talking about and said to contact again. So I did. Weirdly, the second person was like \"No problem, done. Go enjoy The Grand Tour!\" So I tried to get on Prime and it didn't work. Figured I'd let it be for a couple days. \n\nWhile waiting, my roommate comes back. He left in November to go to India for the holidays. I forgot how much noise he made. He's on the phone at all hours of the day and night. He often puts the other person on speaker phone and will yell his responses. I can't sleep. I mean I can't afford my medication to sleep properly anyway, but this asshole is so fucking loud that I couldn't sleep if I did have the meds. I've gotten maybe 2-3 hours sleep since he returned last week. I turned the music on once at 10AM and he had the nerve to tell me to turn it down. That pissed me off even more. \n\nWhile all this is going on, I'm waiting for the government to tell me what happened to my disability cheque. They keep saying they're doing investigations and will have another sent out as soon as it's done, but that does fucking nothing for me. We don't have food stamps here so I can't go get that. Food bank is miles away and my knees are fucked, so getting there is hell to begin with and coming back takes multiple hours. Even if I did get there, I don't have a current statement from the government with my address on it because they didn't send the goddamned cheque. \n\nSo I go back to Amazon. Prime still isn't working. So Customer Service tells me it's just a glitch and they'll reach out to me in 12 hours. They do. 12 hours later they say I never had prime to begin with. So I contact customer service AGAIN. This time I get someone who calls me darling every 3 seconds despite me asking repeatedly for her to knock it off. She says that they did give me an extension on the prime but it was an extension of nothing because the prime was already over. She then hangs up on me. So I say fuck it and tweet Amazon. They respond and ask what's wrong. I explain. At this point I don't care about the free prime. I had no right to it anyway, I always thought it was a longshot, but being told a half dozen different things is just bizarre and confusing. They then don't respond for a day. So I say \"Uh hello?\" And another amazon rep comes on twitter to ask what's wrong. I explain again. No response. Today, 4 days later, I say that it's the worst service I've received. Amazon immediately jumps on and gives me a link to contact. I do and don't even get a chance to explain. The dude just says another department will reach out to me.\n\nThen I turn to Canada Post and ask why the hell I didn't get stuff delivered. They shrug and say \"We deliver until 8PM.\" I'm checking the mail continuously. We have no mail and no one else has gotten mail in the neighborhood. We live next door to a Canada Post and have never had this problem before. Maybe it's the weather? No. People across the road got their mail. Just that we didn't. So no cheque for me today despite being told I'd get it today. That means no eating today, no meds today, no paying bills today. Sitting in the dark crying all night. \n\nLike I said it in't much. But this is overwhelming to all hell to me and I'm freaking the fuck out. I want to beat the shit out of my roommate because he won't shut the fuck up, I want to scream my goddamn head off at Amazon because they won't give me a straight fucking answer. I want to lose my shit at the government because they lost my cheque and i've been without any money since the start of December. \n\nTo top it all off, a storm kicked up at 3PM and I can't go dumpster diving for any food. Tomorrow it's going to be worse and colder so I won't be able to go dumpster diving then either AND the mail likely won't show up again. \n\nI just fucking want this all to stop. everythnig.

I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.\n\nI realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.\n\n**Background**\n\nGrowing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she \"made it to where I didn't have to testify\". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.\n\nI had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by \"quickly and physically ending the disagreement\". After hearing that I got out of his car, said \"goodbye\" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for \"leaving\" them.\n\n**The Videos**\n\nI started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought \"Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first.\" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled \"1996\" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying \"no\" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?\n\nI was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from \"1996\" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks \"right?\" to my sister and she says something like \"only mom and dad think \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ is a brat.\" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.\n\nI gave myself a couple days after that footage. I was afraid I'd see something worse. I decided to watch my sisters birthday party in 1996. It was on another tape labeled \"1996\". My sister is turning 5 and we are at the local pool with some childhood friends and some family. I see my cousin and I see my childhood friend. I instantly remember inappropriate things happening with those boys. My cousin used to pretend we were \"married\" when we were around that age. He would make me go into a bathroom after our \"marriage\" and undress with him. He always locked the door. He is about 2 years older than I am. I remember feeling like it was wrong but that he was older so it must be ok. I don't remember much of what happened in the bathrooms when this stuff used to happen. I know for sure it happened in 2 places. I know I was crying at one of them and my sister was knocking on the door. It was a family vacation. He has a daughter now and she is about 5. I hate him.\n\nMy childhood friend I mentioned, he also made me take my clothes off because of what \"grown ups do when they get married\". This must have been at the same age as my cousin incident. I remember something weird he did once he made me lay on top of him, he said we had to touch nipples....then I remember his mother walked in on us. I felt instant embarrassment and guilt, but being so young, I didn't know exactly what was wrong. She never said anything or did anything. This friend is still in my life and also has a brand new daughter. They were at my wedding and so was that cousin. I feel sick thinking about this. How could his mother not have done anything!!?? I saw her face in that video too and felt even more sick. Once we were in the high school ages, we spent more time together. He talked me into cheating on my boyfriends because \"kissing isn't cheating\". He'd feel me up and I told myself it was ok because we weren't having sex. I hate myself for this.\n\nI hate seeing these people on my video tapes and remembering these things. It makes me feel like my family isn't real. It makes me question if things really happened even though I know certain things definitely did. I continue to doubt myself and pretend I'm ok. I'm not ok. I'm having a very hard time with these new things and I feel physically sick reliving these things.\n\n**Can having abusers in life be a pattern for some survivors?**\n\nI have had far too many moments in my life where my innocence was taken from me or I was hurt in different ways. I was raped by an ex for years. He took photos of me after he drugged me when he took me out of the country. He was so much like my father. So many red flags and I should have ran screaming, but he was SO manipulative. He told me no one would ever love me like he loved me. He exposed me to HEP-C for years and never told me. He cheated on me. He would tell me I was overweight and that my style was boring. He told me I didn't \"do anything\". He would force me to have sex with him every day multiple times a day. I was fresh from treatment, he was sober and had been for years. I thought he was safe. He even convinced my mother he was great along with other family. He has thousands of nude photos of me from the age of 18-22. He refused to destroy them when I begged for many years. He'd always convince me to come back when I'd leave him or when he said something painfully horrible. He'd show up at my apartments while I was in college in the middle of the night yelling at me. He was a 3x felon. He was an addict and when I left for good, he started drinking again and then using drugs. No idea where he is now, but I pray it's prison. He had his 3 strikes.\n\nI also have been in a friendship where a guy in college became obsessed with me and stalked me. I had to go to the Dean of Students because he had signed up to be in every one of my classes. This was after he had left things at my doorstep, stood outside my front door at 3am whispering my name and sending me paragraphs about how he wanted to \"practice having sex\" with me \"because we are best friends\" and he \"felt like I would give him feedback\" *WHAT THE FUCK!?* \\- Guess what - the college only asked him to change classes. That's it. The Dean told me they would kick him out of the college, expel him from classes that semester or ask him to change his classes. I had to tell all my professors on my own because the college didn't have my back. He even showed up in NY when I moved after college, and I moved across the country.....I finally got rid of him when I moved from NY.\n\nThere was a guy in college who raped me because I was too drunk to drive home one night. He offered his bed and he slept on the couch until he joined me in bed later that night. I woke up and he was having sex with me. I remember he noticed I woke up and put a condom on. I was frozen. I didn't know what to do. I left when I could see the sun was coming up. I wouldn't talk to him and he acted like he didn't know what was wrong. He'd even send me texts if he was on the same bus to tell me he was behind me. I'm still confused by that.\n\nI'm sorry I spilled this mess here. I have a lot in my head and I don't know how to get it out. I have no one to talk to. No one understands unless they've had these things happen. I'm tired of sharing with someone I feel I can share with and they tell me they don't believe me, or ghost me completely. I had began to keep it all to myself for a few years in college and now I'm busting at the seams with flashbacks and panic attacks. I had a flashback when I was skiing with my husband this year. My father did things to me once when he was teaching me to ski as a kid. I was in the trees and it all came back. I don't know how to talk to my husband about these things. He doesn't understand. He means well and he's good to me, but he will never understand what I feel and what happened to me. I've never been able to really heal from any of this and I'm just now remembering things. I feel like a pile of used, damaged crap. I'm in a new city now, and I don't have any close friends here. I feel lonely and these flashbacks have affected my social abilities. I'm always on edge and I just thought I could share on here and someone might be able to tell me I'm not crazy and that I'm not bad for what happened.
