So, my brother is 25 right now and I am turning 17 in May. When I was 7 he r*ped me and I didn\u2019t tell my parents until October of 2018...Since then all that has happened it a switch of rooms because he used to have to walk through my room to get to his. He still lives with us because he has high functioning autism and can only really work at a grocery (as he is now). My parents don\u2019t want him to work too much or he will no longer get disability and they\u2019re scared he\u2019ll have a fit at work and get fired even though he\u2019s been working there for like 2 years and been fine.\nWe don\u2019t have enough money to get him an apartment. My parents don\u2019t think he could survive on his own, so I\u2019m stuck living with him. \nSince I told he doesn\u2019t talk to me or look at me. I do the same towards him. This was until maybe 3 months ago when he had an outburst and screamed at me saying I\u2019m a \u201cjunkie lair who should finish what she started and kill yourself\u201d (I used to smoke weed and have attempted suicide before). \nHe\u2019s had an outburst like this three times now where he yells at me while I lock myself in another room. Talked to my dad about it and he said unless he sexually touches me or punches me hard (not light shoving) they aren\u2019t going to kick him out.\nA week ago I was sleeping on the couch because it\u2019s right by my parents room and makes me feel more sleep. He then went into the living room in the middle of the night and slept in the middle of the floor.\nHe\u2019s being creepy. He yells at me like once every week and half calling me a lair etc. Being in a house with him without going to school or to friends makes me feel terrible.\nI would stay at a friends but my mom has severe COPD so I can\u2019t because of the virus.\nI don\u2019t think I can do anything. I\u2019m only allowed to leave the house for a 2 hour walk every other day. I\u2019m unable to function well enough to get my schoolwork done. I feel terrible. I feel unloved by my parents even though I KNOW they love me, but they refuse to do anything! It makes me feel terrible! I don\u2019t want to hurt myself but I almost want to go to a psychward so I don\u2019t have to be here! Or run away and live under a bridge! Or something! I feel so fucking trapped.\nIf you read all of this please at least comment \u201cthat\u2019s fucked up\u201d so I know I\u2019m not crazy for feeling so terrible because my parents are acting like it\u2019s not big deal while also saying they believe me and it\u2019s making me feel nuts. \nSorry this is so long and badly written.

{"id": "1035_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD coming in waves Im a recovering heroin addict.  I\u2019m still at the beginning stages of dealing with PTSD, stemming from trauma related to my addiction, incarceration, and physical trauma from being hit by a car 7 or 8 years ago on my bike.  \nI don\u2019t really want to get into all the details of things that happened to me, or things I witnessed happening to people close to me.  \nMy reason for coming here is more about what I\u2019m experiencing now.  \nI relocated to another state 3 years ago to get treatment and I\u2019ve been off of heroin since I left my home state.  I met my soon to be wife, had a baby and work a good job with benefits.  Everything was getting so much better.\nBut I left with active warrants in 3 counties and we took a flight back to one of those counties to start taking care of it.   \nPretty much the whole time we were there I was fine.  Saw the judge, explained why I left and let him know I\u2019m ready to do whatever it takes to get this out of the way of my life.  \nIt went well, but I have two other counties to appear at in the near future.  Everything went better than expected. \nSince we came back home It\u2019s like a switch was flipped and everything feels out of control.  I don\u2019t feel safe anymore.  I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and I\u2019m having a really hard time coping with the reality that I\u2019ll probably be locked in a cage again at some point. I found myself curled up at the foot of my bed yesterday crying with my entire body convulsing as I remembered very specific events that have taken place over the last 10 years.  \nI can\u2019t sleep, I can\u2019t handle my daughter when she cries, I keep flipping out in anger over the smallest triggers.  (Wife burned her hand on a hot plate, screamed in pain, and I flipped out.  Yelling at her and had to leave the house for a walk to cool down.). \nAnyway I\u2019m wondering what I can do to stop myself from emotionally hurting the people I love during this time.  I\u2019m not violent, never physically hurt anyone, but I\u2019m so afraid of ruining the life I\u2019ve built while I learn how to process all of this and move forward.  It\u2019s so strange to me because right now I\u2019m totally fine.  I can think of all the worst memories or possible outcomes and be totally willing to go through it, but my episodes have been triggered so quickly and randomly that I don\u2019t see how I can stop myself in the moment.   \nIs it normal to be able to recall memories and be fine with it one day, and then have a completely insane reaction throughout my entire body over the same thoughts another day?   \nAgain, I\u2019m not worried that I\u2019m going to do any physical damage to anybody, I just don\u2019t want my family to see me like this and remember it for the rest of our lives together.  I don\u2019t want to scare them or cause their own traumas and issues in life because of my inability to rationalize this.  \nI have my first emdr session coming up on Thursday and I\u2019m going back to work in the morning so I think that will help.
