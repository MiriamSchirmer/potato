{"id": "1673_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Things get easier. My experience of getting better. Brief mention of abuse without getting into details (also start and end are pointed out) This post was supposed to be a rant. \nI was feeling a bit gloomy after a flash-back, but as I kept writing I started to calm down. Hence the change in the tone.\n\nAlso, I wanted to point out that what I'm talking about is obviously just a small part of the process of getting back on your feet, but still it felt essential to me. Everyone's experience is different and this is just my personal perspective. \n\nSorry for my broken English, I hope this can be helpful to someone. \n\nI guess I have improved a lot in the last year. \nI really don't want to go back to the hole of despair I was trapped in, but sometimes I get scared I might let myself slip off into it again.\n\nTo prevent that, I make sure to bury any thoughts about my past very deep as soon as I sense them arise, of course some of them manage to sneak out and they get back at me in spades.\n\nI still get glimpses of moments I had successfully forgotten about. \nIt makes me feel like I'm still there, but it happens less and less frequently and every time it gets easier to snap back. \n\nUp until a year ago, I was leading a life that was split in half between the present and the past. \nThe present seemed to be so dull, as if I were half-asleep, while the past felt so much more real and threatening.\n\nI used to be so angry, I don't know how else to describe it other than it felt like fire was running through my veins. It was the only thing I felt and I couldn't help but cling to it, since it seemed to be my life's sole purpose and sustenance.\n \nI kept reliving the events of my trauma, going through them in my head over and over again. Each time getting angrier and angrier. \nI didn't mind it at all, I was actually glad for this blind rage. As if it fueled me. \n\n**START OF TRIGGER WARNING**\n\nI had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. \n\n**END OF TRIGGER WARNING**\n\nAfter I escaped, ordinary life was simply idle.\nHadn't it been for this anger, I would have just gone numb.\n\nAlthough comforting, I came to realize that I would have never been able to move forward without letting go of it all, the anger, the constant replay of gruesome scenes in my mind, the pointless questions that would never find any answers.\n\nThings were also getting out of hand, to the point where I involuntarily broke my friend's arm as I was startled by her giving me a hug unexpectedly. \nI was horrified at what I had done. \nI'm a petite girl but I've been fighting professionally for a long time and I couldn't bear the thought of harming someone whose only fault was getting caught between my messed up brain and me. \n\nIt's a hard process to forget about the abuse I had been through as a child and then again as an adult, but I'm managing and it does get easier. \nI had never thought it to be true, but time really does heal all wounds.\n\nBut most importantly it's the people you love. Keep them close. Even if you feel the need to cut everybody off and confine yourself in your pain, don't. Don't let this trauma induced sentiment prevail.\nIt's not what you or your loved ones need. \nThe ones we care about are the only thing that keeps us grounded to reality, to the present. \nYou can take small steps, there's no rush, you don't have to let everyone in on everything you are feeling unless you want to. Just try, as difficult as it is, to be open to their affection. \n\nBeing passionate about something is hard after you have survived trauma and readjusting to everyday life is particularly disorienting when you don't have a purpose, you just feel hollow. A good place to start is making it a point to be able to take care of the people you love. Having to be someone your dear ones can rely on, eventually makes you get back on track and you are going to become even stronger than you were before. \n\nIt's ironic how being a survivor makes you feel so dead inside, it might feel like you have lost all control over your own body and mind. \nBut please know this kind of feelings are only temporary. You have gone through a nightmare and made it out alive. You will overcome these feelings as well. \n \nYou won't have to look back at the person you were before in sorrow, you are growing to become someone you will learn to love. \nYou will have suffered greatly and still been able to pull yourself back up, you can accomplish anything you put your mind to. \n\nLife only gets better and better from here, it's tough but so are you.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2004, "end": 2047, "span": "being tortured and raped every single day, ", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 11s "}}
{"id": "2694_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Do your siblings deride you for bringing up the abuse you experienced? Haven't posted in r/ptsd, but this came up. \n\n# Family Makeup\n\n(If you want to get to the question at hand without my life story, just skip to the heading \"The Dilemma\")\n\nI am from a large family. Middle child of 7.\n\nI never really knew my father (for the best, really. I have zero desire to know him), because he was sent to prison (rightfully so) when I was very young. Before I can remember, honestly. But my brother and I were his sons. My parents had 3 other children before us, my 3 older half-siblings (I rarely call them half-siblings, only for clarity sake when detailing family histories). This story really doesn't include my older half-siblings for the most part, only briefly. They are 10, 9, and 4 years older than me.\n\nWhen I was 2 or 3, my mother met and married a new man, we will call him Harry (his name was not Harry). And they had a daughter together, my younger half-sister. So, my younger brother, younger sister, and I were all born within 3.5 years of each other, my younger half-sister being 3.5 years younger than me.  My father also had another daughter when I was 13. So, my siblings and I range in birth years from 1975 to 2003.\n\nBut really, this story focuses on me, my younger full-brother (11 months younger than me), my younger half-sister (3.5 years younger than me), my mother, and my step-father.\n\n# The Wretched Brothers (TW: Physical and Verbal/Emotional Abuse)\n\nSo, my step-father would abuse my brother and me, a lot. Every night. He was an alcoholic, and would often beat my brother and me, along with more severe physical abuse (&gt;!burning us with cigarettes and coffee irons, pushing us down the stairs, locking us in the basement, forcing us to sleep on tiles floors underneath a pool table.... so much. We would have bruises and burns that we had to hide from school officials. !&lt;). Not only did he physically abuse my brother and me, he also abused our mother in similar ways. The infraction could be as mundane as ... well nothing. Sometimes, I am convinced he just did these things because he enjoyed to see us suffer. Honestly. Because we would do absolutely nothing, but get punished for it. Spilled milk? Punished. Breathed too loudly? Punished. Sat in the corner minding our own business? Punished. And by \"punished,\" I mean the abuse that I have hidden under spoiler tags.\n\nBut, though the physical abuse was intense, the emotional/verbal abuse was much, much worse. A bruise can heal, but the things he said to us affected our whole lives. This was much more than just being overly critical or saying hurtful things now-and-then. This was constant. He would call us the worse things imaginable. He refused to let us go anywhere because he said that we were thieves (we weren't). Every night, he would angrily tell us how worthless we were, calling us the most vile names. We were locked in the basement when company was over because we would \"embarrass him.\"\n\nNow, looking back to when I was a kid, from what I remember, we were pretty much like every other child (I had some bizarre idiosyncrasies, but my brother was completely normal, honestly). And asking people who knew us from that time, we were regarded as pretty delightful children, who weren't prone to mischief more so than any other child. Actually, we were described as timid and respectful.\n\nBasically, the abuse did not match our behavior. And even if we were the terrifically unruly children that he said we were, we didn't deserve *that.*\n\nAlongside the physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, there was also neglect. We didn't have beds, and were forced to sleep on the tile floor under the pool table. We rarely got the clothes we needed, having to wear clothes that we obviously had outgrew. And, for a time, we were homeless and couldn't get food. Much of this was due to abject poverty, but even when we weren't in dire straits, we were still not afforded the necessities. This also falls somewhat on my mother, but that is unfair to blame her for any of this, which I will expound upon later.\n\n# The Golden Child\n\nI suspect you saw this coming. My brother and I were abused and neglected, and my younger half-sister could do no wrong. Now, of course, she was his daughter. And in many ways, she was raised as if she was an only child. While my brother, my mother, and I were relegated to the basement floor, my half-sister lived a life of privilege upstairs. She got all the newest clothes. She had her own room with a bed. She got anything she ever wanted. And, growing up in a household like this, I assumed this is just how life was. Boys were treated like trash, and girls were treated like royalty. It made sense at the time, I suppose (mind you, I was under 12).\n\nI cannot tell you how many times my brother and I would be punished for something my sister did. We would *watch* our sister do something terrible, then blame it on us, and we would get punished. Then our mother/step-father would praise her for being brave enough to tell! It was infuriating!!! No matter how much my brother and I protested and told the truth, no one believed us. My sister laughs about this to this day.\n\nNow, looking back she too was being abused, just in a different way. The favorite(s) is(are) being abused just as much as the scapegoat(s). It is just a different dynamic.\n\nTo illustrate how different our lives were, my older half-sister on my father's side would call to talk to my brother and me. We weren't allowed to talk to her, but my younger half-sister would have full conversation with her. I didn't find this out until I was an adult, and my older half-sister told me. No one told us that my older half-sister called us ever. But, every time she called, she got to speak with my younger half-sister. Mind you, they are not related in any way (I suppose they share two half-brothers).\n\n# The Nightmare Ends\n\nFrom the time I was 3, until the time I was 12, this was my life (with a small respite when my mother finally got fed up with it all and left him for a few months). Nothing I did was good enough (a trait that has followed me throughout life). Daily being abused. Watching our sister live an entirely different life. And having nothing to compare it to, because to us, this was how things *are.* We didn't know it wasn't normal to be treated like this. It wasn't until maybe high school that I realized, \"Wow, people didn't live like this!\" But, it finally ended one day in October when I was 12.\n\nHarry died unexpectedly. I shed not a single tear. I was sad for my sister. I was somewhat sad for my mother. I was sad for Harry's parents. But, in almost all ways, I was relieved and happy he was dead. So was my brother. And I suspect, my mother was at least relieved he would no longer torture any of us.\n\nMy sister was 8 years old at the time.\n\n# My Dear Mother\n\nI love my mother. I feel like she did the best with what she had. She loved each of us intensely. She had an infectious laugh, and a caring spirit. She was a joy to be around. Most of the time.\n\nCounterintuitively, my most horrific memories have to do with my mother. You see, she was schizophrenic, and because of that, every single one of us children went through some awful experiences.\n\nNow, when she was not experiencing a psychotic episode, she was the loving, amazing woman we all adored. But during those true psychotic episodes (of which she had no control over, having breakthrough episodes even on her medication), I and my siblings experienced some of the most traumatic experiences of our lives. Later in life, while I was an adult, so more prepared to cope with the trauma, my mother once blew up her oxygen tank, setting fire to her assisted living facility. Throughout the years, she had numerous episodes.\n\nThis is why I rarely blame my mother for not doing enough to protect us and herself. She was scared herself. Harry, on more than one occasion, &gt;!threatened to kill her and my brother and me. My mother would tell us that she would often wake up with Harry strangling her in the middle of the night. Plus, he was a hunter, and kept her gunpoint - metaphorically.!&lt; Add this with her underlying mental illness, and it is very difficult to assign any blame to my mother. She couldn't work, and at the time, she couldn't get on disability either. The one time she did find the courage to leave Harry, we ended up starving, freezing, and homeless. And then Harry came to stay with us while homeless, before eventually moving us to his car, then his parent's motorhome, and then finally.. the basement.\n\nSince my mother was in a vulnerable position (her mental health and having no income due to disability), it just seems like predatory men found her, and made her life (and her children's lives) miserable.\n\nIn my head, yes, the experiences were traumatic, but in the same way a hurricane or earthquake is traumatic. Who do you blame?\n\n# The Aftermath\n\nSo, now it is well over 20 years since Harry died. My mother passed in 2013 due to lung cancer/COPD. I have spent years in therapy, trying to heal. Even tried to be a therapist myself (big mistake. Trigger. Trigger. Trigger. HOSPITAL!). I have lived with daily SI since probably the time I was 9, and have had nearly 20 psych hospitalizations throughout the last 20 years. I am living knowing that I survived quite an ordeal.\n\nBut, my brother did not survive Harry's abuse. He died by suicide when he was 17. Clearly, Harry wasn't the only trauma that we had experienced. Often times when my mother would have a psychotic episode, my brother and I would be shuffled in and out of foster care. Sometimes together, sometimes apart. One time we were put in juvenile detention because we were \"too old for foster care.\" We were 13 and 14. We had different privileges than everyone else because we weren't there for \"delinquency,\" which actually made us more of targets (we got treated differently by staff, so the other boys would beat us, and one &gt;!sexually assaulted us.!&lt;\n\nI got emancipated when I was 16. Had my own apartment. Went into the Army. Became an Army nurse. And here's the thing - basic training was *fun.* It was a breeze compared to what I had experienced earlier in life. Got out of the Army, went to college. Made a life as best as I could.\n\nBut even now, one thing still bugs me.\n\n# The Dilemma\n\nSo, now whenever I bring up Harry around my half-sister, she gets angry. She has said that I am exaggerating what happened, and that it wasn't that bad. I love my sister, and we are actually very close, but this is a real kicker.\n\nShe doesn't even acknowledge that her father did anything wrong. Which makes me question my own experiences. But it isn't like I am the only one saying these terrible things about her father. My mother confirmed what happened. My older siblings confirmed what happened. Even one of my half-sister's *cousins* confirmed what happened.\n\nWhich was oddly satisfying when I learned that her cousin confirmed the abuse. I was very active in church, and so during testimony, I would sometimes detail some of the experiences I had with Harry. I had a church mentor/friend who thought I was exaggerating, because to her, it sounded so outrageous, it must not have happened.\n\nWell, I started working for this church mentor/friend, and a few years later, we bring in a new employee. Without my permission, my boss/mentor/friend starts divulging my personal history to this new employee (yes, I realize how inappropriate this is). During the conversation the new employee thought it was weird how similar it was to the story of her aunt's and uncle's family house. Turns out, my half-sister is the employee's cousin once removed (my step-father is her cousin). She then goes on to inform my boss/mentor/friend how terrible the situation actually was, and that I might even have been minimizing what happened, definitely not exaggerating. This was a cousin who I was not even allowed to see because it would \"embarrass\" my step-father. Any time she would come to visit, we were locked in the basement.\n\nHow can my half-sister not acknowledge this? At least say something like \"I know my father was a complicated man, I still love him, but I abhor what he did to my two brothers.\" Or... anything? To her, \"Harry did nothing wrong, and the things he did do, y'all deserved it. And actually, it was our *mom* who messed us all up, not my dad.\"\n\nIt is hurtful and infuriating. To the point that we cannot talk about her dad at all.\n\nAnyone else experience this kind of gaslighting?", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1596, "end": 1899, "span": "beat my brother and me, along with more severe physical abuse (&gt;!burning us with cigarettes and coffee irons, pushing us down the stairs, locking us in the basement, forcing us to sleep on tiles f<span class=\"span_container\" selection_label=\"trauma\" style=\"background-color:rgb(230, 25, 75, 0.25);\">l", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2210, "span": "e also abused our mother", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2682, "end": 2705, "span": "emotional/verbal abuse ", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 3141, "end": 3164, "span": "locked in the basement ", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 9704, "end": 9739, "span": "He died by suicide when he was 17.

As soon as he opened the door, jokingly said \u2018Hmm it smells like gas. Best walk briskly so we don\u2019t get blown up!\u2019 I saw the construction workers across the street crowded around where I occasionally park when running late. I have a HORRIBLE sense of smell, so I was taking in the air, trying to remember what natural gas smelled like. Continuing down the sidewalk, I remember saying, \u2018good thing you\u2019re here because you know I can\u2019t smell, I wouldn\u2019t have had a clue!\u2019 \n\nThere were 2 seconds left on the crosswalk; knowing he\u2019s a stickler with the rules I quickly paused as I watched my boss step into the road, speed walking through the white lines of the intersection. As soon as we crossed the street.. BOOM!!! \n\nIt was almost an out of body experience, the whole thing really. The shock wave from the explosion pushed us down the sidewalk, I felt it go through my body and down the sidewalk in front of me. All of the windows outside the building next to us instantaneously shattered, raining down on us and into our eyes.. I remember looking at my boss as he screamed at me to run. \n\nMy ears.. it was like a tornado had just ripped through my head.. then then the pounding and ringing started. I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn\u2019t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming \u2018WHAT THE FUCK\u2019 at each other out of shock.\n\nPeople starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating \u2018don\u2019t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.\u2019 I remember the confused look on their faces..\n\nIt\u2019s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I\u2019m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me. If we had finished our experiment a minute later, or stayed at the crosswalk, or happened to walk at a slower pace.. it\u2019s so fucking terrifying. I\u2019m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. \n\nBegging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they\u2019re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it\u2019s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...\n\nIt\u2019s only been 4 days, but it feels like it\u2019s been an eternity. I didn\u2019t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it\u2019s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...\n\nI do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. \n\n\nBut at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen? It\u2019s all so surreal and yes I\u2019m extremely thankful to be alive, but the survivors guilt immediately crept in. I\u2019m a trained BLS instructor, and I just ran.. I understand there was nothing I could do to save anyone, but I still feel so much guilt and shame.. \n\nI just needed to get it all out.

Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). \n\nIn the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.\n\nThere were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.\n\n While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. \n\nThis man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. I never got to complete my university degree because I was trapped under him when I should have been there. Also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now I have several quite severe chronic health conditions.\n\n I completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. Because I can't work, I can't afford proper health care or therapy. I have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and I don't think I'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. \n\nI don't live with a victim mentality but I think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me.\n\nThank you for reading my account because I need to get it out.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 855, "end": 878, "span": "groomed by an older man", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1599, "span": " blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day.", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2024, "end": 2035, "span": "gang raped ", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 27s "}}

{"id": "2082_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Do I have PTSD? I'm sorry if I'm ignorant and offend anyone who does have to deal with PTSD everyday, but here's my story:\n\nEver since I joined the military 3+ years ago at the age of 23, my life has improved dramatically, I was truly happy and felt like myself. I was doing \"wild\" things like partying and clubbing on the weekends and even one night stands with strangers from the bar or online dating apps, and other \"wild fun\" things (that I prefer not to mention for the sake of my career) I would NEVER thought I'd do based on who I \"was\" prior military.\n\nHowever, the happier I'm becoming the more angrier I have been getting lately thinking about my past. I'm talking about being cheerful and jolly one minute, singing with the radio driving home from work then suddenly out of no where I'll have flashbacks of shitty times in my childhood    and next thing you know I'm punching my steering wheel and clenching my jaw and just really want to fly back across the United States just to give my family whom I RARELY talk to now, a piece of my mind.\n\n I grew up in a conservative Chinese family. Being a Chinese male, I had a very \"stereotypical\" boring childhood and even lamer time in highschool and college. However, I was not a good student and was a handful as a child that I will admit but I have never thought that my family was abusive until lately and even talked to my co-workers about it.\n\nTo keep things from getting too long I'll list out the things I experienced growing up and always thought was normal until my coworkers and friends pointed out it really wasn't:\n\n- I was strongly influenced to not have friends and always put my family before anyone.\n\n- Even until I was 22 years old I was not to be trusted to have friends over the house without an adult or my brother whom was allowed to have friends over anytime he pleased since he was 18\n\n- My brother (5 years older than me) got to decide whether I can go out or must stay home regardless if there was a reason or not.\n\n- My brother can also tell me I can't have any friends over even when I was 21 years old and still lived with me and my parents.\n\n- My brother would enforce me as a child to \"pat-down\" all my friends who came over to the apartment we lived in to ensure nobody stole anything. This rule did not apply to my brother's friends.\n\n- My mother has threatened to kill herself  and me multiple times when I was a child growing up. Sometimes she would take a meat cleaver to her neck and scream at me and my brother that shes going to cut her head off and kill herself because of us. And sometimes -\n\n- My mother would swerve into the wrong side of the road towards oncoming traffic when we were bad, threatening to kill us and herself.\n\n- When my brother was old enough to drive and he would also swerve into oncoming traffic if I he was mad at me or if we got into a disagreement.\n\n- Ironically, when I was old enough to drive, I also did the same thing to a friend who is still considered one of my closest friend to this day. He pissed me off and I thought threatening his life would help me win the argument.\n\n- I also remember when I was very young my mom told me not to go outside because I had some kind of allergy or Asthma, I did not listen and helped my grandma with her yard because she was going to pay me 20$. I told her and she put her hands around my neck shook my neck and told me she was going to kill me, very angrily and very convincing at least at the time to me.\n\n- More less severe things is that my brother acted like he owned me, like if I wanted to go out and my mother said I could and my brother said I can't he would threaten to take away my games.\n\n- whenever he disallowed me to do things he would sometimes include statements like \"not in my house\" this fucking bitch didn't own shit. He's had three cars handed to him and gave me shit and tried to claim he bought one of the my mom bought him brand new, which I confronted my mom about. \n\n- I believe my step-dad might have caught on to my brother's bullshit and convinced my mom and him that it was time for him to move out.\n\nAnyways , I literally just started having angry flashbacks just now while writing the last three. I think I have more of a grudge towards my brother than my mother. I'll stop here before I go on forever but thank you for those who read this far, I honestly feel that I needed this more to vent than to really seek an answer.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2345, "end": 2408, "span": "My mother has threatened to kill herself  and me multiple times", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 5s "}}

I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;\n\n2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"new version\" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the \"original\" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a \"substitute\" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1521, "end": 1555, "span": "man shooting the girl in the head,", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 28s "}}
