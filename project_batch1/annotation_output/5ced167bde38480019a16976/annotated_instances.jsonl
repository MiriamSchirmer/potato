{"id": "2229_ptsd", "displayed_text": "OD PTSD Sorry long story of overdose ..  I need some advice about something I exeprienced in which I cant really find anything similar to my personal account of seeing someone overdose elswhere online to try and get some answers, other perspectives...\nalthough im still on the younger side, i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse just everything in which i am grateful for because it has made me very tough and able to relate with others.. i was dead sure i could handle anything but this . this has turned my world upside downn. it happened last july and i am much better mentally now but i still struggle with ptsd and triggers... i met this kid wonderful heart but misguided (not an addict)  and still has that feeling of invincibility..anyways we were in my room and the first incident we were on my bed and he was holding himself up on top of me kissing me and then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless . ill admit my first reaction was wrong, i was scared, and didnt realize his breathing and heart were stopping i was just shaking him yelling his name.. luckily he popped up and was like what happened wherr am i.. but quickly fell back into his high .. i knew from there something wasnt right so i was on high alert  (he had apparently taken stuff before he got to my house that i was guessing but wasnt sure).. after that he  snorted one in front of me i begged him to stop but he wouldnt and i couldnt force him to stop in that mindset he had . he then went in to use my bathroom (separate toilet room from shower area) and i was like okay ill just keep calling his name to make sure hes okay.. ( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right\u00bf but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone \"stops breathing\" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn ..", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 879, "end": 1034, "span": "then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless ", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 2021, "span": "then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2572, "span": " i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 2m 28s "}}

A little bit about myself first... at the age of 16 i almost died in a car accident by myself, at 25 i got hit by a family van at 45km/hr on the street. and at the age of 27 i got in another car accident at 70km/hr.   \nSo yes I've got some serious trauma and all my life i asked myself one question. how can i be happy in my whole being naturally like a baby does? \n\n  \nand I've went through an amazing journey to discover really deep fundamental of life. I've always been a positive and resilient guy and that helped me a lot in my life.\n\n  \nbut i wanted to create my dreams and one of dreams was to be happy again in my body. i knew that for that to happen i had to find a way to heal these past trauma.\n\n  \nMy goal was, how can i be able to think and relieve a trauma and be free from the emotional baggage of it because i knew that your life is the reflection of what's inside of you.\n\n  \nSo here's the step by steps way to do this. warning! trauma can take a while to heal but if you stay consistent with this you will see a really big difference over time and it can be rough to go through this but it is worth it.\n\n  \nso the first step is to think about the trauma and then really focus on your whole being (emotions, mental, physical and energical patterns) when you think about the trauma.\n\n  \nfeel the feelings related to the trauma scale them from 1 to 10, 10 meaning it's the worst feeling ever.now take your two hands in front of you and do this. imagine all these feelings, these beliefs etc... imagine them going into your hands and push them into the universe take a breath wait couple of seconds. \n\n  \n**it doesn't matter if you don't believe it will work. DO IT! for the sake of your happiness!!!**\n\n  \nthen refocus on the trauma and see how you feel NOW thinking about the same trauma. \n\n  \nscale on 1-10 again (sometimes you can feel the emotions spiking up it is alright just continue this process.)\n\n  \nsee how you feel thinking about it and do it again\n\n  \nso see the trauma, see how it makes your body react, scale it, put it into your hands, send it to universe, take couple of breath. verify how you feel again.  \nRINSE and repeat.\n\n  \nDid it work for you? if not comment below i'll help you.\n\n  \nRicher Morin", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 64, "end": 245, "span": "at the age of 16 i almost died in a car accident by myself, at 25 i got hit by a family van at 45km/hr on the street. and at the age of 27 i got in another car accident at 70km/hr.

Xanax was my coping and I got addicted. I'm beginning to understand why all this began surfacing again. Also my ex fiance called me a textbook psychopath so I was beginning to lose who I was anyway.
