I tried to block my ears and i had my eyes closed, but the scene sprung up out of nowhere so i saw about 2 seconds of it.   \n\n\nEver since then I've been a mess. I've barely been able to shower, haven't been able to clean, haven't been able to eat, I didn't sleep properly for a few days (kept waking up every half hour). A couple of nights ago half way through sex I had a flashback and I don't remember anything after that, but apparently I was crying a lot and completely non verbal for a while. I 'completely shut down' and he had to really try to get any words out of me, apparently. the next morning i had false awakenings where i was just lying in bed being spooned, then his hand comes and grabs my mouth and shoves me into the bed. i woke up in a panic and realised he was just cuddling me so i must be dreaming, but other than that i absolutely can't distinguish what i dreamt from reality. I realise i've had the same thing before - dreams where 'arms', sometimes someones, sometimes invisible arms, grab my mouth and shove me into the bed.   \n\n\nI have PTSD but I don't actually know what the cause is. I can make a very good guess, but I just have symptoms and learning my triggers, with no actual solid memories. apparently once I told a friend what i thought happened while i was throwing up and crying and screaming (first ever flashback episode), but i don't have any memory of even doing that.   \n\n\nThere was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't. He says it never happened. Now with this false awakening, I'm worried that I've thought ill of him when it actually was just all in my head. What if it was just a false awakening.   \n\n\nI haven't been able to stop crying. i have this constant feeling of terror. And i have no one around me to help. because of my ptsd i push everyone away one way or another. when something triggers me like this i can end up completely non functional. i just want a normal fucking life and a normal brain and a boyfriend. i feel like i'm never going to be able to have any of that because of what some fucking cunt decided to do to a little kid.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 1746, "end": 1881, "span": "\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't.", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 55s "}}

If I did well in school (A:s were the only acceptable grade) helped her by being her emotional support as soon as I came home from school aka listening to her problems etc she would not beat me. But as soon as I did the slightest wrong she beat me and told me that she wished that she had just done an abortion etc \n\nI remember that my mom used to beat me when I was 4-7 years old just because I was so ugly.

She forced me to have my hair up in a high ponytail or else she would beat me and pull my hair.

Me and my BF M21  has been in a relationship for 2,5 years and he is wonderful. The problem is that I am so insecure, I can worry that he will meet someone better if he goes away to work or just goes to buy some groceries. I am constantly feeling as if I am not enough and that he will leave me for anyone because I see other people as better than me, like I really mean every human I meet. I have a lot of anxiety and have a hard time talking to him about this, I really try to and are not actively refusing to talk but I often just don\u2019t know how to describe it. I also don\u2019t want to control him or let my anxiety make him shitty because it is not his fault, he has never given me any reason to even be worried but still I feel like shit.

I go to trauma focused therapy (PTSD) so I am working on it and by BF knows about it and we always talk about it.

I still feel like there is this underlying tension, probably because he still says its because work was and has been really busy and so while I see him more often now (but not as often as before I said anything) i feel like the same thing can happen again at any moment if I do or say the wrong thing (like mentioning or alluding to assault at all).\n\nThis ever happen with anyone else? Advice on how to deal with friend?\n\nAnd advice about how to deal with the impact of this on myself? Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad. But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame. I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it. I had told one friend over skype and she was supportive over text as well and didn't stop texting me or anything like that but I havent talked about it to her at all in person since she moved to the same city as me so I guess a part of me is worried she'd react the same way (not wanting to see me in person) even though she hasnt done anything like that. \n\n**TL;DR how do you deal with friend that suddenly feels uneasy around you after disclosure of trauma/ptsd? How do you keep it from making you feel bad about having ptsd or telling anyone else about it, especially on really bad days when u really need some semblance of support?**", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 87, "end": 108, "span": "I had been assaulted ", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 53s "}}
