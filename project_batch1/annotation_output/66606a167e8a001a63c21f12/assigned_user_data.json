I have a paper due and it is stressing me out. Usually I called in sick once every two weeks or worked from home once a week because getting out of my house in the morning gave me anxiety. I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up. Maybe I just need someone to tell me you know its okay to call in sick, you dont have to feel guilty your working on yourself and thats whats most important. I self lack this view because I mostly dont consider myself helpworhty, which is another problem on its own. \n\nI already contacted my mentor from school yesterday. The last time we spoke she told me I could figure it out with the internship company if I knew what would work for me. Problem is, I dont know what works for me. Each day is different. Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go.

Not sure if this sub is the right place. Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or \"go see a therapist\" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.\n\nOkay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating/introspecting/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.\n\nEither way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.\n\nIn particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.\n\nThere is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers", "displayed_text": "Some thoughts on dissociation?

I can't do that because it doesn't feel like that, speaking from an emotional standpoint.\nI guess I'll just say it was really bad.\nNot so long ago, I broke up with a girl who i guess you could say wasn't the best.\nShe kind of treated me like crap, made me feel like everything was my fault.\nEven looking back and knowing it wasn't, a part of me feels so guilty for something I know wasn't my doing[yet it still feels so].\nShe disregarded my feelings, then up and left for about three months, putting quite a bit in front of me, which I could understand at first.\nYou can't put everything on hold for one person, and I could understand that even at 13-14.(ive just turned 16 a few months ago)\nIt was online, so it's not like she could've drove near me and do anything, but that really didn't make me any less terrified everytime I saw messages of her being blatantly angry with me, being upset with soemthing I might've done wrong or said.\nWe never called much, which I suppose I'm thankful for, but the times we did, I guess it was okay.\nI guess I was terrified of what my parents would think, given they weren't (still kind of aren't) the most supportive.\nMy father was upset when I came out, being that he couldn't quite accept that I'm gay.\nShe led me on though, and for a while.\nShe was really upset when I wouldn't just accept her confession and that she wanted to go out, so i guess I kind of forced myself to liking her just a bit.\nIt all kind of felt rushed, but I was truly in love with her, despite the fact that others would probably say it was just puppy love(I imagine for good reason).\nShe kind of made me think my friends were the bad ones, like she was in the right.\nI gave her three chances, and I accepted her with no hesitation for every one of those.\nI have flashbacks almost every day, I'm kind of terrified to do much or go anywhere near that reminds me of her.\nI can't even say her name without breaking down.\nI've had at least three panic attacks, one being in school to which the teacher had to escort me out and I had to go home.\nThis may be a bit disorganised, and I'm really sorry about that, but my brain is a bit jumbled and I guess this isn't the easiest to think and talk about.\nThis wouldn't be so hard if I didn't hear her, if I didn't see her in my head everytime.\nThe flashbacks aren't just flashbacks to me you know, they literally drag me in to a point at which I'm choking and trying to get out.\nI tend to panic and not get \"out\" of it for a while, and I more often than not, dissociate from my body in a way so it seems.\nI would go into depth a bit more, but I've been told that's what I do whenever I panic that way by an old therapist.\nThe memories aren't really in order, and I don't think I can remember specific things because they're going so fast, maybe?...\nI don't think fast is the right word, but they're kind of just thrown at me all at once.\nI can phsycially feel her, hear her sometimes, and being shizoafective doesn't help at all.\nI'm so utterly frustrated at the fact that I'm unable to let go, but I don't think my family would deem it \"normal\" for me to say that there are memories holding me down or anything like that.\nThey wouldn't really understand, unfortunately.\nI haven't told anyone about this but a friend who has been here from beginning to now with this whole ordeal, given my family's reaction won't be anywhere near supportive.\nI'm going to a placement centre sometime soon, but I don't know when.\nI'm terrified that I'm just overreacting, you know.\nI'm terrified that a

it was heavily implied that she, at the very least, attempted suicide.\nHow am I supposed to handle that?..\nEverytime I think about it, I just think about the fact that this is just\nIt's nothing compared to something else so much worse.\nShe could've been here, you know?..\nPhsycially been here, but she wasn't.\nI know comparing isn't a thing of suggestion with something like this, but I have

And i constantlt downplay and laugh like im ok and im not and i dont know how to stop. \n\nI dont know how to tell my friends. My husband although also has PTSD has it for different reasons (army vet) and doesn't understand. \nIm so frustrated and lost. I cant get out of my head."}, "2329_ptsd": {"id": "2329_ptsd", "text": "What's wrong with me? (possible triggers) My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC), in April.
