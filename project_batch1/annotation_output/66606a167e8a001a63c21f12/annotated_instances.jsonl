{"id": "2180_ptsd", "displayed_text": "\"Oh hell no! It came back\" a mixture of fireworks and stress. (vent) This will be a brief account of the last few weeks and what it culminated in. Over the last couple of weeks, fireworks have been going off all over my part of town. Often, the people who are doing it set them off late at night 1 or 2 am.  My PTSD, after an incident with people throwing fireworks and a near riot, is triggered by fireworks, bright lights, loud sounds and people in a confined space. I have for the last two years kept this under wraps with a few problems along the way like zoning out or feeling rising panic in some situations, as well as some sensor issues.  \n\n\nEither way, back to the fireworks in my town. With the fireworks at night, I have found that if I start my bed rutin again or get a specific fluffy blanket I can usually calm and soothe myself to sleep.  However a few days ago, just before New Year's eve as I was walking from the bus station after dropping my friends off, I noticed some kids running towards me. Thinking they were running to the bus I sidestepped out the way and kept going. Then it happened, I was close to coming round the corner and then \"bang\". A big flash of red light and sparks flew from around the corner. My first reaction was to stand still and as the last kid past me, I struggled not to grab onto him. My next reaction was to feel like crying. Which after a brief feeling of outer bodyness turned into a need for a smoke. I recently, and frustratingly, bought a packet of cigarets due to the bangs and the stress they were causing me. After that I then got back did the washing and tried to call the police non-emergency line to no avail, gave up and drank some whiskey. This obviously was a bad idea and just made me feel even worse. The follow on from that was to clean like a maniac.  \n\n\nRoll on new year's eve and fireworks are everywhere, people on squares and roadsides. I was with my friend so it was a little better. At our party it seemed to miss a lot of the fireworks, We saw the new year in and crashed.  The day after new year's day, everything came crashing down. My reaction to stress was to just sleep and after I tried to get some work done I just broke down and smoked all my cigarettes. The stress and isolation this brought just hit me with a large hammer. Why was it like this? Who could I contact?. I tried contacting one of my friends and gave up. Then a feeling of needing to get out of this came about me and I got scared. I knew I had alcohol at home and that was a risk. So I ended up ringing my friend and ask them to be an accountabl\u00f6ity buddy for the night, as I was scared  I was going to go on a binge.   \n\n\nToday, after writing this out I have eaten which was hard to do over the last few days and I have finished tidying. It feels like releasing some of this crap and meditating has helped.    \n\n\nThank you for reading.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 308, "end": 409, "span": "My PTSD, after an incident with people throwing fireworks and a near riot, is triggered by fireworks,", "annotation": "uncertain"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 56s "}}

We heard voices in the dark, angry scouse accents shouting \"pass me the blade\" and so on, and my friends began to run. I looked back to see 12 men run out of the dark yelling carrying knives and took off after my friends. When we came to the path of the second bridge one grabbed my friend who I had overtook and went to stab him him the back. I tackled the man and my friends got away, however I was then cornered into a grassy clearing and questioned on where I was from, told they were going to drag me to the dark and kill me, and I resisted their attempts to drag me. I was thrown back onto a construction fence, the only thing separating me from the water. Before I know it I was set upon, seeing strobe light like vision as my eyes were being punched repeatedly, my legs were brown from the dirt and being kicked relentlessly, and I was dodging and diving, swinging, trying to fend for myself, when I see one run up and plant a Stanley blade into my head, just above my eyebrow. It got stuck as the assault continued and part of my cheek was cut off with a much larger knife in an attempt to slice my eye out, they talked about finishing me and argued over who should have the knife and before I know it one charged aiming for my neck. I managed to grab his wrists and twist the hand but he put it through the skin in-between my thumb and index finger. I twisted his hand the whole way and felt a crack and he fell back causing his friends to look away.

I would teleport back to that dockyard on repeat screaming and tangling my bedsheets, put my drink down in a bar and come around over a mile away as I'd just freaked out and ran and ran, with little to no memory of these episodes. I was and am a paranoid mess, and my gentle nature has become anxious and aggressive. I can't remember if I've clocked in at work, what I learn in classes, what I ate for breakfast, and when I did go on medication was so drowsy and whacked out my mind I couldn't learn either way. I fell asleep in work, classes, I stopped taking them. I now am back to essentially square one, and have already savaged one of my attackers when I seen him in broad daylight.

{"id": "1598_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Introductory post..kinda?//about my PTSD Hi guys. I\u2019m new to this sub reddit.\n\n\nI\u2019m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. \nI totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn\u2019t do anything. \nI had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn\u2019t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don\u2019t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.\nI\u2019m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can\u2019t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can\u2019t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. \nI also watched the worst accident I\u2019ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I\u2019d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn\u2019t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn\u2019t ok to drive. \nSo.. yea. I don\u2019t really know where I was going with this, I guess I\u2019m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they\u2019re doing better now. \nI don\u2019t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can\u2019t even do those things.\nI\u2019m trying so hard. I just feel like it\u2019s pointless sometimes. \n\nAnyway if you read this super long post..\nThank you.

{"id": "2111_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I have nightmares when I'm awake and I feel no one takes me seriously. Im 23 years old. Around 2009-2010 I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. That alone was hard enough. But I had a fairly abusive childhood and things started getting worse family wise, I dont even know where to start. \n\n2011 my dad attacked me. And my family brushed it under the rug. Every day I see the scar. Everyday I think of it. \n\nIve always struggled, but I guess Im too good at hiding it because friends and family just brush me off. 2018 I was finally diagnosed with PTSD, but that was after seeing my husband attempt suicide twice,a severe car accident, and being in such a bad place, on top of the trauma already there. \n\nI snapped last month. I couldnt do it anymore. I quit my job. I dont sleep. I have nightmares. Im constantly angry and yelling and I dont know how to stop. Im just this aggressive mess and its like nightmares while Im awake. Vivid flashes in my head and I just stop and the world goes silent. \n\nI am in therapy, but my thoughts are so jumbled that its like word vomit and i cant focus. And i constantlt downplay and laugh like im ok and im not and i dont know how to stop. \n\nI dont know how to tell my friends. My husband although also has PTSD has it for different reasons (army vet) and doesn't understand. \nIm so frustrated and lost. I cant get out of my head.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 290, "end": 315, "span": "2011 my dad attacked me.
