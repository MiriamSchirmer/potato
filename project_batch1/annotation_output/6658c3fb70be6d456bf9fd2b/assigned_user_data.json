And when I was growing up, it\u2019s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don\u2019t resolve any issues. And it\u2019s true.

And it\u2019s taken a full toll on me.\n\nThe relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn\u2019t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father\u2019s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad\u2019s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn\u2019t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places.

After 2yrs, I finally got her to a doctor so she could start an anti-depressant regiment. I didn\u2019t just push her to do it, thinking it would change everything. When we began dating, we had known each other for a few months (work), and anxiety was apparent. I learned of her PTSD and Depression shortly into the relationship. I deal with depression myself, so I wasn\u2019t about to give up on someone for things they can\u2019t control. I was clear with her of my goal for her in our relationship: to be happy and healthy.\n\nHer family life is almost non existent, and she has moved around most of her life. She severed ties with (some of) the abusive relationships in her life about 2 years ago. We moved in together because we spent most of our time together and we wanted to save money. It\u2019s been almost 2 years living together (after only 8-10 months of dating). Cracks are beginning to show.\n\nWe have two roommates, who I like very much. She always got along with them until recently. Our apartment is 2 couples, M-F / M-F. It\u2019s a two bedroom, so yes, it gets a little cramped, even though its a big place, one bathroom is a constant pest. \n\nLately (past 6 months), the girl living with us has made it clear about keeping things clean, using our own appliances.. usual passive-aggressive roommate stuff. I\u2019m used to it, I do NOT take it personally from the girl, we still chat in a very friendly way frequently, and I\u2019m good friends with her boyfriend. I see these grievances as small troubles, roommates setting boundaries, etc.\n\nWe have lived with this couple for the entirety of us living together. Problems just started to arise about 6 months ago. The girl would get pissed at messy bathroom, moldy stuff in fridge, etc. NEVER became vocal about these problems. Began to show some passive aggressive behavior: Slamming bathroom door, leaving notes, sending TWO texts, JUST TWO over a few months.\n\nI see this stuff as normal, my girlfriend is losing her mind. The slamming of bathroom doors led to her having flashbacks of her shitty father. I spoke with the roommate, and explained the situation. It stopped happening. The girl asked that my GF start using her own electric kettle due to overlapping morning schedules. My GF\u2019s electric kettle was given to her by one of her attackers at her last apartment. That was hard to explain to girl, so we gave it away to avoid more triggers for my girlfriend.\n\nNow, my girlfriend is being triggered by the girl loudly doing her own dishes. This, I had to make a stand on. They were not my gf\u2019s dishes. She had no dogs in the fight. Yet she blamed her INCREDIBLE anger where she stormed into our room and stayed for the night, on loud dish-doing. \n\nMy girlfriend is not a clean person. I can deal with it, try to get her to clean, but it is not my roommates\u2019 fault that she is this way. \n\nThe girl left a note on a tupperware container tonight saying \u2018PLEASE DISPOSE\u2019 and my girlfriend lost it. Inside? A month of veggie smoothie mix that had a lump of mold in it so large that I couldn\u2019t wash it down the sink, I had to pick it out and trash it.\n\nMy girlfriend? Threw a fit and LEFT IT OUT on the counter. Walked away from it. Meanwhile the moldy cup in the living room I asked her to clean will start a fight if I bring it up. \n\nThe note? She wrote 'FUCK OFF' on it, then threw it away out of regret(?). Left it for me (I guess?) to clean, like everything else.\n\n\nThis escalation between the girl and my GF is getting out of hand. We are moving in 6months. I believe that my GF is overreacting and its unnecessary anger, stress, and confusion adding to the situation. \n\nI have stood by my GF for almost 3 years. I have read about PTSD, slowly pushed her towards treatment (finally got her to the Dr for anti-depressants, she hadn\u2019t been to a Dr in many many years). I have tried (slowly) to get her to therapy.. we made a few appointments that she canceled (a while ago). \n\nI feel like my GF isn\u2019t trying. She is being overloaded. She is also being selfish and rude when that is in NO WAY the person I knew years ago. I have been patient with her conditions. I have tried nothing but to help her. I have made stands on some things (almost exclusively cleaning, especially our room that looks like a disaster area, due to her). I\u2019m approaching the end of my rope. Completely ignoring me begging her for years to clean, explaining that it stresses me out the way her triggers do, is starting to really piss me off and make me feel like she doesn't care about my happiness if it means an ounce of work for her. \n\n**TL;DR** My GF is freaking out over my roommate\u2019s recent actions. I believe it is a completely irrational response. I have taken triggers into consideration, but believe she is being selfish and closing off. I have tried to help her as much as possible, but I have my fears that if this is how she acts now, what will our future (on a different coast we\u2019re moving to) hold. That fear has me questioning our future, viability, health, etc.\n\nAny input would help. I can\u2019t possibly say I fully understand PTSD, but I have tried for years to help her, and plan to continue. I feel insensitive when claiming a trigger or her anxiety in certain situations if irrational, but I truly feel this has been. I can give more specifics about her PTSD.

For the most part, I have no emotional connection or recall of the majority of my life. Some of it however is that my brain is not reciting things as a memory as much as it is a fact, I can't specifically place it in the timeline of events, it is just something that happened. This can be extremely frustrating and distressing when the content is trauma related, but it is especially frustrating when it's something neutral that I feel obligated or entitled to remember. The rest of my life is in the void and I'm only 19. Also does anybody have fevered episodes that are dedicated to frantically proving your existence from your childhood?

She doesn't understand why we sit in the back of a restaurant and I always have to face the door. \nShe doesn't like when I drink but she knows it keeps the monsters (memories) at bay - flashbacks are less frequent when I've had a few adult beverages. \nShe also doesn't understand the mood swings and the anger that sometimes wells up. I try to warn her that this is not a good time for a discussion and it pisses her off. There are no support systems for families where I live - the Philippines  - so she just puts puts up with my bs.  \nDamn, I'm rambling now. \nAnyway, I look forward to reading posts here about how people cope with their monsters. \nSorry for the rambling, but it's been one of the bad days. \nBTW, I never physically abuse my wife but I can get loud sometimes and I know that can be just as bad. She loves me and puts up with my shit. \nI sold all my weapons but there are days when I wish I hadn't. \nOh, and I was in counseling for a year. Useless. I take no drugs,  like xanax or any of that shit but beer, brandy,  and gin are great pacifiers. ", "displayed_text": "PTSD since 1976 Hi, all \nI'm new here.
