For reference, I (21F) developed severe anxiety and depression when I was 19 (which also had some C-PTSD mixed in from being ostracized at school for years growing up), got put on the wrong drugs that made me suicidal, and was sent to a Christian inpatient mental health facility for seven weeks. The things that happened in that place are what really led to the development of full-blown PTSD, and especially as I\u2019ve started therapy and started to fully grasp what happened, I can feel it kind of getting worse.\n\nThe hardest part for me right now is the anger. I used to be such a nice, friendly person who never got mad. Now it\u2019s like any minor inconvenience sends me into full-blown rage. I feel like I can\u2019t control my emotions anymore and I\u2019m really scared that everyone around me will start hating me for it. I hate feeling this way, but I just can\u2019t stop being angry.
