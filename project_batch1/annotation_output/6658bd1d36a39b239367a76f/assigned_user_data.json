She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. \n\nGoing to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. \n\nI was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.\n\nI dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. \n\nI dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.\n\nHonestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.\n\nI feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. \n\nIt's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. \n\nBut still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right.

I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. \n\nI'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.\n\nI know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. \n\n**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD.

(Trigger warning) First, I'm not suicidal. So when I say I'm tired of life...I don't mean I'm ending it. I just want to acknowkedge that life just really fucking sucks sometimes. And it's tough. And exhausting. And frustrating. And full of chaos and unfairness.\n\nI've had a difficult life. Not as difficult as some but just a lot of bad unfair things happening to me and me not deserving any of it.\n\nI've been burned (when I was 3), emotionally abused by my mom, hit by three cars (all from distracted drivers...i was actually stopped in the 2 recent ones and people just hit me...causing concussions and disc bulge and severe whiplash), abused in a toxic relationship, dealt with depression, self harm, anxiety, and had a pulmonary embolism because of birth control. I'm 34. What else is life going to throw at me??\n\nI mean wtf?? I'm so tired of getting knocked back. I've had psychological issues and possible PTSD from the trauma of getting burned as a kid...and my mom never addressed it. She kept saying that something was wrong with me and I needed to get fixed (that I was broken). Well...duh! I suffered trauma at a young age. Then because of her emotional neglect and abuse I've spent the majority of my adult life working on my self worth and going through therapy.\n\nWhen I think life is good...I get hit by a car head on in 2016. I now have chronic pain. It was so hard dealing with all that pain and the hopelessness and depression and PTSD. But I got through it. I started to heal. Then I got a pulmonary embolism in 2017. If the outside world wasn't safe...surely my own body is safe? Wrong.\n\nNow I had PTSD related to body sensations. Being on blood thinners for 8 months was horrible. I felt sick and weak and scared all the time. But I got through it. I went to therapy. I processed. Then again life was seeming okay. I was healing and getting more safe.\n\nThen I get hit by another car. Rear ended while stopped behind a bus and pushed into a pole on the side walk. This was June 2019. I've had vertigo and neck pain. My poor brain and body can't take any more of this trauma. My emotions can't. It's hard to drive. I get scared at any fast car around me thinking how easy it is for one of them to not pay attention and then kill me. Maybe the next one will kill me because life seems to want to do that.\n\nI'm just really tired. What'll I do? Just keep existing until something else traumatic comes along.\n\nMy relationship with my bf may also be ending. Not in anger or drama...in sadness that sometimes it just doesn't work out. That love isn't enough when two people have opposing needs or values. We love each other but that doesn't mean it'll work.\n\nI wish I just had an okay life.

(Trigger warning) First, I'm not suicidal. So when I say I'm tired of life...I don't mean I'm ending it. I just want to acknowkedge that life just really fucking sucks sometimes. And it's tough. And exhausting. And frustrating. And full of chaos and unfairness.\n\nI've had a difficult life. Not as difficult as some but just a lot of bad unfair things happening to me and me not deserving any of it.\n\nI've been burned (when I was 3), emotionally abused by my mom, hit by three cars (all from distracted drivers...i was actually stopped in the 2 recent ones and people just hit me...causing concussions and disc bulge and severe whiplash), abused in a toxic relationship, dealt with depression, self harm, anxiety, and had a pulmonary embolism because of birth control. I'm 34. What else is life going to throw at me??\n\nI mean wtf?? I'm so tired of getting knocked back. I've had psychological issues and possible PTSD from the trauma of getting burned as a kid...and my mom never addressed it. She kept saying that something was wrong with me and I needed to get fixed (that I was broken). Well...duh! I suffered trauma at a young age. Then because of her emotional neglect and abuse I've spent the majority of my adult life working on my self worth and going through therapy.\n\nWhen I think life is good...I get hit by a car head on in 2016. I now have chronic pain. It was so hard dealing with all that pain and the hopelessness and depression and PTSD. But I got through it. I started to heal. Then I got a pulmonary embolism in 2017. If the outside world wasn't safe...surely my own body is safe? Wrong.\n\nNow I had PTSD related to body sensations. Being on blood thinners for 8 months was horrible. I felt sick and weak and scared all the time. But I got through it. I went to therapy. I processed. Then again life was seeming okay. I was healing and getting more safe.\n\nThen I get hit by another car. Rear ended while stopped behind a bus and pushed into a pole on the side walk. This was June 2019. I've had vertigo and neck pain. My poor brain and body can't take any more of this trauma. My emotions can't. It's hard to drive. I get scared at any fast car around me thinking how easy it is for one of them to not pay attention and then kill me. Maybe the next one will kill me because life seems to want to do that.\n\nI'm just really tired. What'll I do? Just keep existing until something else traumatic comes along.\n\nMy relationship with my bf may also be ending. Not in anger or drama...in sadness that sometimes it just doesn't work out. That love isn't enough when two people have opposing needs or values. We love each other but that doesn't mean it'll work.\n\nI wish I just had an okay life. That I grew up in a supportive household and that I don't know what it's like for an 800 pound object to be speeding towards me, completely helpless in every way. \n\nThere's no control in life.

We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. \n\nThis man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn\u2019t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He\u2019d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.\n\nOne of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend\u2019s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. \n\nHe continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me.

After a whole night of pleading him to take it down, we reported it and it disappeared. A couple days later, he posted it again.
