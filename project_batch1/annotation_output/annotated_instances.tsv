Usually the bad days I'm able to smoke a bowl, snuggle with my dog, and watch Netflix until it's numbed enough I can go to sleep. When I wake up, everything is a little better.

He used to not let me sleep, so for the longest time, I had difficulty sleeping. I felt unprotected when I slept, so I would like awake. I would listen to the creaks in my floorboards, thinking he found my new life and is here to ruin it. Or the breathing of my husband might stop and I will think he's been poisoned. If my dog barks, which he never does, I tense up thinking he's outside the gate. But usually I can trick myself into sleeping. Be it a melatonin or ZQuil. 

Sometimes I can't trick myself. Sometimes I can't get myself to take a melatonin because I'm terrified of not being in control. I can't smoke because what if I need to defend myself. 

Last night was bad though. I haven't had a night like that in awhile. I tried smoking, I tried melatonin, I tried snuggling with my dog, and nothing helped. I did not get more than 10 minutes of sleep last night. 

I'm even more emotional and irrational and scared and my patience is thin. And I don't feel I have many people to talk to about it. My husband sometimes understands, but his perceived inability to ""fix it and make it better"" makes him withdraw sometimes. And it's not his job to fix it, so I don't push him.

I know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed.    I have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before. I have been thinking a lot about her comments and whether I truly am an inconsiderate person who is not thoughtful, spatially aware of surroundings/people, or positive, but in the end, I am feeling awfully hurt about how this has affected our relationship.

Have any of you developed OCD to a degree within your PTSD? Is this common? For example I have a lot of trouble sleeping beyond the nightmares, if I hear any noises outside or see a shadow or even my reflection in my bedroom window I am triggered. The last month or so I have started locking and unlocking my apartment doors, 10,20...30 times a night when I am triggered at night. This past week I have been doing it even when I am not triggered, for example when I return from work I will lock the door and then unlock and lock it a dozen times. My therapist suggested giving myself a limit of how many times I can do this and resist the temptation to continue by distracting myself. 
Any tips for this? Between nightmares and triggers my sleep is already disturbed enough, but spending an hour on the doors is really exhausting.

6658b57fad6d072d4f20800d	55_ptsd	"Day 2 quitting weed, a lot of emotions (x-posted to r/leaves) Hi everyone. So it’s day 2 for me. I started smoking two years ago to self-medicate PTSD. I believe it has turned into an addiction, with me forgoing food and rent in lieu of buying weed (I don’t have a lot of money so I can’t afford this). I think it did help, but has turned into something uncontrollable at this point. I know I can manage my traumas without weed and with healthy coping skills. Today I’m feeling the weight of anger towards people who have hurt me, who have taken away my basic rights as a human being to my own thoughts and feelings. I realized just now fully that when high, it distracts me and I don’t think about all that stuff.

I’m still trying to rebuild my identity. I feel very very very small. I also don’t eat a lot because of stress and have at times gotten to under 100 pounds, which makes me feel so small and weak and powerless in this world. Completely vulnerable. I feel like certain people have taken advantage of me, and shoved me deeper and deeper into the ground, abusively controlling and judging me when no one has any right to make another person feel like this; like everything that I think, do, like, don’t do, don’t like is wrong. I lived with someone who corrected everything I did, gaslighted me, etc. There are a handful of people I got away from but never got the chance to really stand up for myself.

So now I’m looking at this life I have, no money, no car, no place of my own, underemployed…and I just think…it’s been years of being a doormat and look where it’s gotten me. I’m a people pleaser and never make a fuss with people, I’ve become mute in a lot of situations. I’ve been admitted to the behavioral health clinic several times against my will even though I was not violent and I’m literally just a tiny girl. I’ve been condescended to in those places, belittled, threatened, etc.

All of this is coming up and I feel frustrated. I don’t necessarily feel angry at these people, because they have their own problems and if they were happy people, they wouldn’t treat others the way they do. But I feel a sense of wanting to be strong, wanting to build my life, and wanting to finally have my confidence back. I have been made to feel like garbage for how I chew, for how I walk, for how I do almost anything and even though I’m not in that abusive situation anymore, I still act and feel like they are right over my shoulder and I don’t have any say in my own life. As if all my thoughts are stupid.

I do not like to feel this, I don’t like to feel angry. It makes me feel ugly and petty. I know how hard life is, even for the people who have hurt me, and I want to feel nothing but graciousness and forgiveness towards them. I guess being clear-headed today is just bringing up a lot of emotions and I’m so grateful I can share my thoughts here. I hope I will one day feel confident and strong and like my thoughts do matter. By taking care of myself, I hope I can get there. I wish wellness and recovery towards everyone here, thank you for reading :cherry_blossom:

tl;dr: how do you deal in a triggering environment that you cannot escape? or is it impossible and you must just avoid environments such as those? 

details below

tw: very light mention of domestic violence, medical problems, men, fear

background: i (23f) have been through an inordinate amount of trauma, a large sum of it at the hands of angry people and bad men. i’m in great shape but my heart rate usually sits, resting, at around 95+. i’m nearly always in a state of panic, even though i seem externally very relaxed. this continuous level of stress is obviously not good for someone and has actually caused some really severe health problems. that being said, i can’t handle being around trigger right now and i won’t heal in doing so. 

my partner (22m) is a mental health wreck. he has a case of long untreated bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, anger management issues, anxiety disorders, unable to handle stress in any capacity, even a crumb of annoyance will set him off, bouts of delirium, psychosis, history of heavy and severe drug abuse, alcohol abuse, self harm, suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization, five or six inpatient stays with psychiatric hospitals, etc. (all of which can be remedied with counseling and med management but he never stays on it.) (in my defense i rejected his proposal for relationship for about 6 months, knowing i wanted to be alone and heal, but after about a hundred times of “let me take care of you,” “you need somewhere safe i can give you that,” “i’ll be so gentle and kind” etc. i believed him. (do not ever do that, lmao. he put on a really good show) and now we’re stuck together. our financial situation and life circumstance will keep us in the same house together for at least another year. we also have mad history and depth so it’s not the easiest thing to uncouple from. he’s currently in counseling and it’s helpful, but only so. 

situation: that all being said... i can’t handle being around his constant negativity and anger anymore... he rages a lot, slams stuff, curses, says mean things about things and people, it’s so toxic and terrible i shake everytime he’s home. he does it in the morning too, complaining about EVERYTHING. if we’re out of toilet paper it’s “of COURSE there’s no F***ING tp, oh my GOD.” when all he has to do is grab a roll from the cupboard and put it on... it’s literally everything. all the time. i can’t keep being in fight or flight mode constantly it’s actually literally medically killing me. i can’t live like this. i was in a relationship before w a man that had anger problems, and anytime he became upset like i showed above, i would end up badly injured so it’s a very potent and literal trigger that’s constantly happening. i’m sick to my stomach even right now. my dog is scared. all the time. i can’t take that. my dog. 

question: what can i do to protect and help myself? how do i bring my heart rate down? calm myself in his terror? earbuds? what else? what can i do for ME in this situation to help? i’m honestly thinking we’ll have to quietly prepare ourselves to separate in the YEAR at least it’ll take to be able to do that, but in the meantime... do i just avoid him? is it possible to heal and thrive in a triggering environment? as someone w ptsd so severe, do i deal or do i just avoid that environment entirely?

Anyway so I used to know this guy and he was like my music teacher and I always saw him as a fatherly figure since I was like 13 at the time and home wasn’t great. He’s always look after me and I felt safe with him. 
So fast forward to now where I’m mid twenties and my music teacher messages me on fb asking for a catch up and I was like sure why not! Seems innocent enough. So anyway we are at this cafe and just catching up and half way through the conversation he starts talking about the reason he stopped teaching music was because he was kicked out because one of his students (16yo) had accused him of having sex with her and he had housed her for many nights in a house with only 30yo men because she had been kicked out and that he took her to his house late at night and she just stayed there. So he got kicked out and his girlfriend left him. And at the time of him telling me this I started to feel really sick to my stomach, and then he does something completely unexpected and start talking about this cheeky slightly lewd photo I had posted and how I had grown into such a beautiful woman and how I should feel good about myself because I’m sexy. 
And so I finish the conversation and go home. I couldn’t shake this feeling of just feeling yucky and gross and used and ashamed and embarrassed.  I kept thinking why did he say that? He’s supposed to be my friend, why did he make it weird? I kinda just wanna curl into a ball and cry and I don’t know why.

I need to vent to someone who understands. 

I have C-PTSD from prolonged childhood trauma. It’s been a terrible struggle to keep my shit together and live as normal of a life as I can.  Several years ago I attempted to go to school to get my degree. 

There, I was raped and beat up at a party. This triggered a downward spiral that led to a suicide attempt that got me kicked out of school. I lost my job, my relationship and ended up homeless for a while. I was a wreck and unable to keep even a simple restaurant job. 

I’ve spent the last few years clawing my way out of this pit. I forced myself to get through a shitty retail job even if it meant vomiting and crying every day before work. It was fucking hell. I only made it due to the kindness of some wonderful people. Sheer gratitude that someone cared enough to try to help me gave me what I needed to make it. 

Today, I have a career I am proud of. I am almost entirely out of debt. I am in a healthy and stable relationship. Until tonight I felt like I was finally moving on with my life. 

Today, I took a big step and decided to go back to school and take one class. Part of enrollment involves watching a graphic video about sexual assault, harassment and domestic abuse. 

I was completely taken off guard by how upset this video made me. I started sobbing in the middle of Starbucks. It was humiliating. 

My partner was really sweet and made me feel a bit better with a mix of r/corgi videos and hugs. But I just can’t shake it. I’m shaking right now. I am having flash backs and intense hyper vigilant reactions. 

I feel like someone just kicked me off a ledge and I am so angry. I’m angry that this is the establishments response to the nightmare I went through.

6658b57fad6d072d4f20800d	69_ptsd	"Paranoia about Being Bullied Again So I took CBD today and it calmed me down mentally to allow me to be more conscious of all the thoughts I have. I realized (what I already knew, but now more so than before) that I always feel like people are laughing at me and judging me. I noticed that when I was walking on the sidewalk today that I had all this mental dialogue going on (almost like schizophrenia) hearing all the imagined voices of the people driving past me making fun of me and laughing at me. Laughing at what I wore, laughing at my face, laughing at my walk. I was afraid that one of them would be someone I knew or worse, one of the people who bullied me.

So for the first time I truly acknowledged my anxiety and asked why I felt this way....by doing so I confirmed a belief I previously only partly held.

*It is that because I was bullied by so many people (like 15) (ostracized, yelled at, made fun of and told constantly that no one liked me) that it must have been my fault, or else why would so many people mistreat me and even the ones that didnt partake just allow the abuse to happen and even become friends with these people? If they were really doing something wrong surely no one would willingly befriend bullies or not stand up to them when it happened everyday right? Because everyone knew it was going on, they all saw. It must be my fault of this allowed to happen. So I thought that since I caused it, there is something about me that will cause this to happen with other people aswell. Thus i see everyone as a potential bully, and no self talk changed the anxiety when I was out today***

I saw someone I knew and though she smiled at me I shut down and after our conversation I just wanted to go home and I wasn’t even present the entire time, my mind kept going back to memories of being yelled at and made fun of the whole conversation even though she was laughing with me. I kept going numb because I felt like if I emotionally checked out, then any bullying that I expected on her part wouldn’t affect me because I wasn’t emotionally there in the first place. All of which I became aware of is something that always happens but cbd made me more conscious of it, it made me more conscious of things that had already been there but I just ignored/I had been denying because I didn’t want to accept that I was mentally ill. 

So how do I, I guess stop thinking that I was at fault for being bullied, or even if I WAS doing something wrong that they just exaggerated my flaws and that I am not a monster that will just be rejected and made fun of by everyone across the board?"

After my dad tried to help me move around thinking it was a pinched nerve and he ended up getting me to the couch. He had me moving my legs up and down like i was marching while sitting hoping that would do something but all it did was keep me focused on the fact that more time went on the less i was able to use my legs and the less i could feel them at all. It happened in the spand of an hour. But i was off to the hospital and that kinda fades in and out. The last thing i remember was that damned room right before you go into surgery. Next thing i know is that im in urgent care and i cant feel my legs or move them at all. I have about a 6 inch incision on my back witb staples in and my family are in the room waiting for me to wake up. Fast forward to now. Im walkin and my feeling is not exactly up to par but its way better than what it was. Im coming up on the anniversary of it and I've been losing sleep rewatching everything that happened.

6658b57fad6d072d4f20800d	26_incel	" yeah, it could of played a role in the motivations of individual nazi politicians, other than that it's irrelevant to the bigger picture. At least I hope, I kinda don't want Nazis to be beta uprising. Also this reminded me of something else, tangent incoming. The comment I replied to reminds me of a larger phenomenon in this community. I've seen it in other places too. People like playing in an ideological playpen and trying to connect countries or movements to inceldom. A strange example of this is that there's an account here that pops up some time to time that's themed around North Korea. This account (or a similar one, I think there's a couple themed around North Korea) tried to make an argument that North Korea is based because most of the defectors seen are women (and then you have new articles about Kim having sex slaves or whatever and other feminist horror stories). Basically, these accounts have no actual support of North Korea, they're just taking its imagery as some identity. Worse yet they take the whatever the media says about North Korea and then says it's true but that's why North Korea is good (""based""). This is just an example. A more annoying example is mylifeistrash who, at least he used to, mentioned China every five seconds and viewed it as the greatest enemy of incels pretty much. And of course you see the defense of nazi germany as a beta uprising. Really shows how far this playpen goes, but all of these special obsessions have their own ""role"" in being absorbed into the mainstream. In the case of the North Korea accounts it's just a strange LARP of a mythical Asian nationalism that actually ends up being anti-North Korea. In the case of mylifeistrash he makes sure to direct us towards China, especially in light if the new primary goal of the Pentagon in countering China. This is sprinkled in with vague all-around anti-authoritarianism. And the nazi stuff is just silly. All of it is silly. Sorry for the rant but I am trying to flesh out words to describe what I've noticed. Obviously everyone is aware of the fringe politics, but it is more about the unintentionally insidious effects of ideological confusion, like all of this stuff plays its own niche role in directing us towards some goal of the western governments (mostly). jfl."

6658b57fad6d072d4f20800d	33_ptsd	"How can I advise a friend to consider therapy? I recently came to understand indirectly that my closest friend might be experiencing some symptoms of PTSD for a trauma that might not have seen any resolution. They're a very private person in general and I understand why they would not have wanted to disclose what they did. But their coping mechanisms had gotten pretty disruptive to our friendship, so I found myself asking after what was up and accidentally put them in a position of having to disclose some details to me in order to answer all my questions.

While they have never mentioned PTSD specifically, it seems like a strong possibility to me as an outsider. My other best friend has talked with me in depth about his own experiences with PTSD, so perhaps the thought started there in my mind. I don't want to pretend I'm diagnosing her, but I am looking to suggest therapy in general without being insensitive or trigger them by accident.

They cited extreme dissociation and emotional numbness and specific flashbacks as things interfering with our friendship and their life right now, and while I recognize that I shouldn't and will not come in to their space claiming to know how to do best for them, based on what they mentioned as their plan to deal with this ongoing stress, I am very concerned that they're entirely avoiding the possibility of professional therapy.

Even if they do numb the negative emotions after the next few months of cutting themself off from others for a bit, I'm worried that that could mean there will still be a lack of healthier mechanisms in place.

I definitely don't want to come off to them like I'm digging into their past. This is their fight in the end, but this person is very dear to me. I stated when I first found out that I would be there for them if they needed me, of course, but I know they're not in a place to reach out actively to me. And like I mentioned, they're very private and I've always respected their natural distance. But this flashback-induced isolation felt so different from that that I ended up digging into their privacy way more than usual and accidentally realized it might be partly due to that traumatic event.

I'm not sure how to reopen the discussion briefly just to suggest with the best intentions looking for professional help. I'd love to hear any advice about how to open this discussion or phrase this or even what to avoid saying that would sound too preachy or unhelpful.

I have my own struggle with depression and anxiety that gets in the way of things, but I was really lucky to have my parents' insurance for therapy when I needed it. TMy friend is not necessarily in that same position, and I know that not everyone might be ready to talk to a therapist right away. But I feel like I want to suggest therapy as their best friend who wants simultaneously to give them time and to just make sure they know they deserve help as much as anyone else.

I'm just not sure that advice is solicited in this situation. And if I could give it without overstepping, I'm just also not sure how to do that. I would really appreciate even a short anecdotal tip if anyone has one. And thank you for your time reading this."

61654bc9d658d4e29aed5c81	94_ptsd	"Wondering if I should get checked for PTSD from familial violence I'm 21, male, and during my childhood I was constantly tormented by 3 people, my dad, my brother, and my aunt. I'd never consider myself to potentially have PTSD but looking up symptoms online made me have a second thought about it. 

My 15-year-older-than-me brother choked me several times during my childhood, possibly with the intent of killing me, because he wouldn't let go until someone would intervene. He started choking me when I was 12, which would make him in his mid 20s. He was NEET back then and still is. He also tortured me in several other ways, like subduing me and pressing his knee into my temple or heatbutting me in the nose as a way to start a fight. I started taking martial arts and self defense classes and I started retaliating against him, when I was around 15. He'd also hit my mom sometimes and I'd protect her. One time while trying to avoid his chokes I cut my head so bad that blood was gushing all over the room - and when I got him off me, he came back and headbutted me in the nose and tried to choke me again, after which I threw him over the table. The whole room was covered in my blood and he was still relentless.

My aunt had epilepsy and blamed it at me since I was 10. She refused to take meds for it because of me and I'd have to take care of her epilepsy attacks since I was 10, a lot of the times I was home alone with her. Sometimes she'd bang her head and get a huge swelling or blood would be pooling out of her head and I had to take care of her alone countless times. Sometimes after the seizures she'd get really confused, almost insane, babble, take her clothes off and try to go off etc, and I had to stop that. Also, watching someone twitch and curl up and their eyes roll up isn't exactly a pleasant thing to watch, especially as a kid.

6 months ago I beat my brother up, choked him until snot was coming out of his eyes because he was threatening my mom and she finally kicked him out. I'm finally free from his constant threat of violence but I still feel really weird from time to time.

My aunt also had her last epilepsy attack around a few months ago, because the doctor said the next one might kill her because it's taking a toll on her heart. Still blames me for it though.

----------

My ""symptoms"":

I know this probably isn't nothing compared what other people go through. I even thought this didn't affect me, I thought most people go through either the same or worse, until I was about 20 years old.

But once every day, or every 2-3 days, I get intense, intrusive memories about these events. I feel extreme anger and hate, my heart rate goes sky high, sometimes even my hands start shaking. I feel like I can't stop thinking about it, sometimes for an hour or two.

This usually happens when I'm trying to study or sometimes it even happens while I'm listening to a lecture at my university. Sometimes at the university I just zone out and kind of relive these events, going though them in my head. Other than that, when I'm not going through this, I have a tough time concentrating. I think ""episodes"" happens when I get bored or when my mind isn't stimulated. Like, I don't think they happen if I distract myself with the Internet or doing some hobby that I like.

 I remember feeling like this at least once a week ever since I was around 15 or so.

  I used to have nightmares about either fighting for life with my brother or my dad or someone else, or about seizures happening to me or people around me every day. Now I have them maybe once a week or two.

I get something that feels like an adrenaline rush when I'm bringing this up, for instance as I'm writing this, or when my brother decides to visit my mom, and sometimes it just happens randomly.

Does this sound like PTSD or at least a reason to visit a mental health professional? I honestly thought PTSD accompanied a lot more brutal traumatic experiences, like what you'd hear in war stories.

Also, I think I've had social anxiety for the better part of my life, but I think that's getting better now.

Does ""reliving a traumatic experience"" necessarily mean you feel all the sensations you felt back then? Or is it enough to emotionally experience it again?

How do I know if this is PTSD or just some normal reaction?

61654bc9d658d4e29aed5c81	52_ptsd	"A poem about my experience. Hi everyone,

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*but I did not comprehend.*

*Jacket-less, I shivered as the rain began pouring.*

*The memory fades.* 

*I came back to myself.*

*The blood cried out the horror,*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*It cried these things to me and many more.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions* 

*with no one there to answer them.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My mom, my brother, my step-father waiting.*

*Mom sobbing as we embraced.* 

*The bullet pierced my heart again*

*My father was not the only one shot that day.*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

*The car stopped, and the dam broke.*

*Blood, tears, and terror erupted from within.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I understand now, truth at a bitter price,*

*that fear is a sacred thing*

*and always has been and always will be.*

*The world was a Different place there.*"	[]	[{'start': 217, 'end': 517, 'span': 'He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him.

It wasnt ""forced"". I was manipulated for a year and a half, and on january 14th, 7 years ago, I was convinced to take anxiety pills, that he was the only one who could love me and wanted to touch me, and so I let him. I thought that sex was just a requirement of love. I didnt realize I had been manipulated for months. Thankfully my parents came home early that day and caught him, otherwise I might not have ever realized what he did was wrong. I was 14, he was 19. He tricked me in so many ways. Made me feel special, convinced me I was his one and only. He used the fact that I had recently developed mental issues and wormed his way into my fragile state. He got me pregnant. He never knew, because I miscarried before the court date 3 months later. It was my first time having sex, my first time being pregnant, and my first miscarriage. At 14. I am now 21. I still have nightmares. I still can barely have sex without flashbacks. I still cringe every time I see his name. I still wince every time I see or hear someone that reminds me. And I still panic every year on that day. 
The worst part? Its not even the flashbacks anymore. Its the baby fever I get that reminds me of the baby I lost. Its the tear I wipe away every time I see my nephew or niece, the moments of sadness when I pass the baby isles in walmart. Its knowing that I had a precious thing growing inside me from such a horrible event, a beautiful star amidst all the blackness, and the stress he caused took that away too. 
But after all this, I have one thing I would like to say to you A.S.W.: 
You didn't get the best of me. 
You may have broken me then, but I am being fixed now and you will never see the woman I am becoming.
You will never know the child you lost, but you will have a stain on your soul that even you can't figure out. 
One day I will be whole again. 
One day I will go days, weeks, months, and even years without thinking of you, and I can't wait to never think of you again.
One day you will die and your soul will be weighed, and you may not have remembered me, but your gods will, and you will get what you deserve. 
So yes, some days hope gets me through, and some days its the knowledge of justice, but I am getting through and I AM DOING IT WITHOUT YOU."

(Due to being a delivery driver and maybe just bad luck) Because of this, if I hear any sort of noise at all, I wake up KNOWING that someone is in my house and they have a weapon, and they are currently robbing me.

I recently described it to my friends as feeling like I'm in my childhood pool that had that dark spot in it. Knowing it's crazy to think there's a shark in it. Getting out anyways in a panic to just double check on the shark. Then slowly sliding back into the pool.

The problem is, is that if someone is robbing me in my home.... I have to go find and fight that shark. I swear I'll spend an hour sitting in silence just trying to hear something down stairs again. Even though the noise I heard was most likely in a dream and I know it.

I also have pets that make noises because they can't help themselves.

I guess I was just venting. Thanks for listening to me ramble reddit."

It should be noted that I’m not pro life. Pro choice all the way, but I knew those people would support me. 

Since this happened to me, I can’t masturbate. I can feel dick and I can feel it when a guy eats me out, but when it comes to my own fingers, my vagina closes up and refuses to let it in.

61654bc9d658d4e29aed5c81	57_ptsd	"Advice: Are these signs of PTSD? Or do I have something else? Hey, everyone! I wanted to share here because this sub looked so supportive and because something has been plaguing me for a while. I just decided to make a new account since I couldn't hold this in any longer.  
Trigger warning for some; child sexual abuse, crude jokes  
I recently went through an involuntary hospitalization (related to perceived suicidal ideation) and some of my typical behaviours and quirks caused a psychologist to take me aside and ask if I potentially had PTSD. I assumed she wanted this information to diagnose me or put it on my precautions sheet\*. While curious, I prompted her to share why she thought so, and she replied with, ""I noticed you've been very startled at loud noises throughout the day. At times, you would stare into space and that concerned me."" Now, I was curious. Although I had a fair share of PTSD-knowledge, I mostly comforted myself with the fact that a lot of them are veterans and just...nullified the possibility of me having it.   
Now, the quirks I demonstrated were, as aforementioned, me jumping at loud noises and loud voices, being sensitive to touch, and also a strange blanking out. I don't remember what one would call it, but it strikes me as a whelming of thoughts about my ""trauma"" (which I'll explain below) and I can't help it when I'm in it. I feel like I'm there, but I don't hallucinate about it. It's just all the feelings of it, and it feels *terrible* when I have these spouts. I don't know if flashbacks are like this, but I'll read more around this sub and try to pinpoint the exact definition of whatever a flashback feels like.   
So, my trauma. To put it short, I was raped by two guys (one over the age of consent, and the other almost there) at the age of 11. When I was 13, I was molested by an uncle. I'm 16 now. I've just been trying to deal with it by...joking. That's the only coping mechanism I have. I, at times, even joke about my trauma. Once, I joked about how I ""need to keep my grades up, otherwise, I'd just be a sex doll."" It hurts, though. I can't stop thinking about how the incident was and sometimes I'm a ball of tears because of it.   
So, what do you guys think? Should I just get over it, or do I have PTSD? Or do I have something entirely different? Thank you so much for reading.

Background: my 16 year old friend just came out about sexual and physical abuse from her asshole father 2 months ago. There is an ongoing complex intense court battle between the 2 of them and her family (who admittedly have always been distant) have chosen to side with the father and isolate/ostracize my friend. She has been on and off again homeless, and because of this, she made the healthy decision to move in with me and has become apart of my family. 
I love my friend, she desperately wants to overcome this but is struggling with a lot of symptoms, and myself and my parents want to learn how to help her any way we can. 
She has these dreams where she wakes up panicking and sweating. Last time she told me that she couldnt stop going over what happened in her head, and although i stayed with her, it took a long time for her to fall back asleep.
She also has flashbacks where she goes in and out of the present and past. For example last week after volleyball she was triggered by the noisy change room and ended up standing in the corner unresponsive to anyone repeating the words ""its my fault"". I ended up getting her alone away from the rest of the team but i need strategies on how to get her out of the flashback. Ive noticed that when shes a present the hypersensitivity kicks in and everythings crazy loud for her but then she cant hear anything when shes back in her flashback. Sometimes it helps to give a hug or hold her hand sometimes it terrifies or irritates her. I dont know how to get her out of it and i hate to see her that terrified. 
The hypersensitivity can be super hard too around the house, sometimes shes able to say that something like the dryer is too loud otherwise we'll find her in the corner of her room with her head between her legs in a panic attack. 
We desperately want strategies to help bring her out of a flashback/dissociation, panic attack, night terrors and just the general feeling of loneliness and betrayal she deals with daily. Also note we just started her with a counsellor who she says is helping a lot, this is just for at home and school. Really and insight into ptsd would be super helpful as were all still trying to comprehend it.

It's ruining my sex life. 

I'm going through so much right now, losing 180lbs, new relationship, being disabled. And on top of it my PTSD is so bad. My anxiety is a mess. I've always got chest pains. 

My sex is fucked.

I want to have sex. I enjoy sex with my SO. For the first time I actually want to engage in sexual activity. And it was amazing when we met. 

Then I started contraceptives. The stress of having no money got more abd being a disabled single mum and the relationship went to shit because of my baggage and me being a shit girlfriend.

And then came the PTSD. During sex.

I was raped right next to where im sat as I type this. So as you can imagine feeling sexy here is hard, we used to have sex in hotels, that was easier. Most the time it didn't even matter where we were because we were together. I was safe. He loved me.

But when I do feel sexy I don't know how to be close to my SO because I know the second I'm enjoying him, the scary shit will come back. And he will end up hating me and I'll let him down again 

When I met my SO I trusted him so much and felt so safe, there were no signs of PTSD or me having any issues with sex and we were happy. He now thinks I don't want sex. Thinks I hate him

I love him, and I've never wanted anyone the way I want him. I crave him. His touch, smell, everything. 

Now he's miserable because I can't be the girlfriend he deserves in the bedroom 

I wish I'd never been raped and I know he's better off without me. 

I don't know how to stop the PTSD. too often those awful thoughts come back and I'm scared and feel ugly and disgusting.

I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever.

I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.

Back when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. 



I knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. 


Earlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a ""shooting in the woods"" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. 

And then this happened.

I'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.

I don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know."

tl;dr: how do you deal in a triggering environment that you cannot escape? or is it impossible and you must just avoid environments such as those? 

details below

tw: very light mention of domestic violence, medical problems, men, fear

background: i (23f) have been through an inordinate amount of trauma, a large sum of it at the hands of angry people and bad men. i’m in great shape but my heart rate usually sits, resting, at around 95+. i’m nearly always in a state of panic, even though i seem externally very relaxed. this continuous level of stress is obviously not good for someone and has actually caused some really severe health problems. that being said, i can’t handle being around trigger right now and i won’t heal in doing so. 

my partner (22m) is a mental health wreck. he has a case of long untreated bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, anger management issues, anxiety disorders, unable to handle stress in any capacity, even a crumb of annoyance will set him off, bouts of delirium, psychosis, history of heavy and severe drug abuse, alcohol abuse, self harm, suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization, five or six inpatient stays with psychiatric hospitals, etc. (all of which can be remedied with counseling and med management but he never stays on it.) (in my defense i rejected his proposal for relationship for about 6 months, knowing i wanted to be alone and heal, but after about a hundred times of “let me take care of you,” “you need somewhere safe i can give you that,” “i’ll be so gentle and kind” etc. i believed him. (do not ever do that, lmao. he put on a really good show) and now we’re stuck together. our financial situation and life circumstance will keep us in the same house together for at least another year. we also have mad history and depth so it’s not the easiest thing to uncouple from. he’s currently in counseling and it’s helpful, but only so. 

situation: that all being said... i can’t handle being around his constant negativity and anger anymore... he rages a lot, slams stuff, curses, says mean things about things and people, it’s so toxic and terrible i shake everytime he’s home. he does it in the morning too, complaining about EVERYTHING. if we’re out of toilet paper it’s “of COURSE there’s no F***ING tp, oh my GOD.” when all he has to do is grab a roll from the cupboard and put it on... it’s literally everything. all the time. i can’t keep being in fight or flight mode constantly it’s actually literally medically killing me. i can’t live like this. i was in a relationship before w a man that had anger problems, and anytime he became upset like i showed above, i would end up badly injured so it’s a very potent and literal trigger that’s constantly happening. i’m sick to my stomach even right now. my dog is scared. all the time. i can’t take that. my dog. 

question: what can i do to protect and help myself? how do i bring my heart rate down? calm myself in his terror? earbuds? what else? what can i do for ME in this situation to help? i’m honestly thinking we’ll have to quietly prepare ourselves to separate in the YEAR at least it’ll take to be able to do that, but in the meantime... do i just avoid him? is it possible to heal and thrive in a triggering environment? as someone w ptsd so severe, do i deal or do i just avoid that environment entirely?

62b1ca10f34adfd4c7a2449f	52_ptsd	"A poem about my experience. Hi everyone,

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*but I did not comprehend.*

*Jacket-less, I shivered as the rain began pouring.*

*The memory fades.* 

*I came back to myself.*

*The blood cried out the horror,*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*It cried these things to me and many more.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions* 

*with no one there to answer them.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My mom, my brother, my step-father waiting.*

*Mom sobbing as we embraced.* 

*The bullet pierced my heart again*

*My father was not the only one shot that day.*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

*The car stopped, and the dam broke.*

*Blood, tears, and terror erupted from within.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I understand now, truth at a bitter price,*

*that fear is a sacred thing*

*and always has been and always will be.*

*The world was a Different place there.*"	[]	[{'start': 115, 'end': 132, 'span': 'traumatic event.

62b1ca10f34adfd4c7a2449f	84_ptsd	"*TW* I still remember like it was yesterday *TW* January 14th marked 7 years since I was r*ped. It wasnt what everyone thinks of when they hear the word. It wasnt ""forced"". I was manipulated for a year and a half, and on january 14th, 7 years ago, I was convinced to take anxiety pills, that he was the only one who could love me and wanted to touch me, and so I let him. I thought that sex was just a requirement of love. I didnt realize I had been manipulated for months. Thankfully my parents came home early that day and caught him, otherwise I might not have ever realized what he did was wrong. I was 14, he was 19. He tricked me in so many ways. Made me feel special, convinced me I was his one and only. He used the fact that I had recently developed mental issues and wormed his way into my fragile state. He got me pregnant. He never knew, because I miscarried before the court date 3 months later. It was my first time having sex, my first time being pregnant, and my first miscarriage. At 14. I am now 21. I still have nightmares. I still can barely have sex without flashbacks. I still cringe every time I see his name. I still wince every time I see or hear someone that reminds me. And I still panic every year on that day. 
The worst part? Its not even the flashbacks anymore. Its the baby fever I get that reminds me of the baby I lost. Its the tear I wipe away every time I see my nephew or niece, the moments of sadness when I pass the baby isles in walmart. Its knowing that I had a precious thing growing inside me from such a horrible event, a beautiful star amidst all the blackness, and the stress he caused took that away too. 
But after all this, I have one thing I would like to say to you A.S.W.: 
You didn't get the best of me. 
You may have broken me then, but I am being fixed now and you will never see the woman I am becoming.
You will never know the child you lost, but you will have a stain on your soul that even you can't figure out. 
One day I will be whole again. 
One day I will go days, weeks, months, and even years without thinking of you, and I can't wait to never think of you again.
One day you will die and your soul will be weighed, and you may not have remembered me, but your gods will, and you will get what you deserve. 
So yes, some days hope gets me through, and some days its the knowledge of justice, but I am getting through and I AM DOING IT WITHOUT YOU."

Anyway so I used to know this guy and he was like my music teacher and I always saw him as a fatherly figure since I was like 13 at the time and home wasn’t great. He’s always look after me and I felt safe with him. 
So fast forward to now where I’m mid twenties and my music teacher messages me on fb asking for a catch up and I was like sure why not! Seems innocent enough. So anyway we are at this cafe and just catching up and half way through the conversation he starts talking about the reason he stopped teaching music was because he was kicked out because one of his students (16yo) had accused him of having sex with her and he had housed her for many nights in a house with only 30yo men because she had been kicked out and that he took her to his house late at night and she just stayed there. So he got kicked out and his girlfriend left him. And at the time of him telling me this I started to feel really sick to my stomach, and then he does something completely unexpected and start talking about this cheeky slightly lewd photo I had posted and how I had grown into such a beautiful woman and how I should feel good about myself because I’m sexy. 
And so I finish the conversation and go home. I couldn’t shake this feeling of just feeling yucky and gross and used and ashamed and embarrassed.  I kept thinking why did he say that? He’s supposed to be my friend, why did he make it weird? I kinda just wanna curl into a ball and cry and I don’t know why. Like it’s not a big deal but maybe if I had done something differently he wouldn’t have said that? I just can’t get over it and I don’t know why. Maybe I’m just overreacting.

I wanted to share here because this sub looked so supportive and because something has been plaguing me for a while. I just decided to make a new account since I couldn't hold this in any longer.  
Trigger warning for some; child sexual abuse, crude jokes  
I recently went through an involuntary hospitalization (related to perceived suicidal ideation) and some of my typical behaviours and quirks caused a psychologist to take me aside and ask if I potentially had PTSD. I assumed she wanted this information to diagnose me or put it on my precautions sheet\*. While curious, I prompted her to share why she thought so, and she replied with, ""I noticed you've been very startled at loud noises throughout the day. At times, you would stare into space and that concerned me."" Now, I was curious. Although I had a fair share of PTSD-knowledge, I mostly comforted myself with the fact that a lot of them are veterans and just...nullified the possibility of me having it.   
Now, the quirks I demonstrated were, as aforementioned, me jumping at loud noises and loud voices, being sensitive to touch, and also a strange blanking out. I don't remember what one would call it, but it strikes me as a whelming of thoughts about my ""trauma"" (which I'll explain below) and I can't help it when I'm in it. I feel like I'm there, but I don't hallucinate about it. It's just all the feelings of it, and it feels *terrible* when I have these spouts. I don't know if flashbacks are like this, but I'll read more around this sub and try to pinpoint the exact definition of whatever a flashback feels like.   
So, my trauma. To put it short, I was raped by two guys (one over the age of consent, and the other almost there) at the age of 11. When I was 13, I was molested by an uncle. I'm 16 now. I've just been trying to deal with it by...joking. That's the only coping mechanism I have. I, at times, even joke about my trauma. Once, I joked about how I ""need to keep my grades up, otherwise, I'd just be a sex doll."" It hurts, though. I can't stop thinking about how the incident was and sometimes I'm a ball of tears because of it.   
So, what do you guys think? Should I just get over it, or do I have PTSD? Or do I have something entirely different? Thank you so much for reading.

I need to vent to someone who understands. 

I have C-PTSD from prolonged childhood trauma. It’s been a terrible struggle to keep my shit together and live as normal of a life as I can.  Several years ago I attempted to go to school to get my degree. 

There, I was raped and beat up at a party. This triggered a downward spiral that led to a suicide attempt that got me kicked out of school. I lost my job, my relationship and ended up homeless for a while. I was a wreck and unable to keep even a simple restaurant job. 

I’ve spent the last few years clawing my way out of this pit. I forced myself to get through a shitty retail job even if it meant vomiting and crying every day before work. It was fucking hell. I only made it due to the kindness of some wonderful people. Sheer gratitude that someone cared enough to try to help me gave me what I needed to make it. 

Today, I have a career I am proud of. I am almost entirely out of debt. I am in a healthy and stable relationship. Until tonight I felt like I was finally moving on with my life. 

Today, I took a big step and decided to go back to school and take one class. Part of enrollment involves watching a graphic video about sexual assault, harassment and domestic abuse. 

I was completely taken off guard by how upset this video made me. I started sobbing in the middle of Starbucks. It was humiliating. 

My partner was really sweet and made me feel a bit better with a mix of r/corgi videos and hugs. But I just can’t shake it. I’m shaking right now. I am having flash backs and intense hyper vigilant reactions. 

I feel like someone just kicked me off a ledge and I am so angry. I’m angry that this is the establishments response to the nightmare I went through. I am angry that I was dismissed and discarded in my time of need. I am angry that I am forced to relive it as part of the price of admission to get my life back. And most of all, I am angry at myself for being so fragile. I am scared that everything I have worked for could be gone in an instance and I could be back on the street. I don’t know what to do.

Usually the bad days I'm able to smoke a bowl, snuggle with my dog, and watch Netflix until it's numbed enough I can go to sleep. When I wake up, everything is a little better.

He used to not let me sleep, so for the longest time, I had difficulty sleeping. I felt unprotected when I slept, so I would like awake. I would listen to the creaks in my floorboards, thinking he found my new life and is here to ruin it. Or the breathing of my husband might stop and I will think he's been poisoned. If my dog barks, which he never does, I tense up thinking he's outside the gate. But usually I can trick myself into sleeping. Be it a melatonin or ZQuil. 

Sometimes I can't trick myself. Sometimes I can't get myself to take a melatonin because I'm terrified of not being in control. I can't smoke because what if I need to defend myself. 

Last night was bad though. I haven't had a night like that in awhile. I tried smoking, I tried melatonin, I tried snuggling with my dog, and nothing helped. I did not get more than 10 minutes of sleep last night. 

I'm even more emotional and irrational and scared and my patience is thin. And I don't feel I have many people to talk to about it. My husband sometimes understands, but his perceived inability to ""fix it and make it better"" makes him withdraw sometimes. And it's not his job to fix it, so I don't push him. 

I guess I just needed to type this out. To make sense in my head of what is happening. To put some organization to the screaming alarm bells in my head."	[]	[{'start': 36, 'end': 89, 'span': ' been 2 years since it ended. And I have great days, ', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

My SO has been really distant with everyone he knows lately and it began to worry me and everyone else. I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his ""voice"". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend ""Jay's"" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.

If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. 



I knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. 


Earlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a ""shooting in the woods"" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. 

And then this happened.

I'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.

I don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know."

He is in an inpatient drug treatment facility and today was our first family counseling session. The therapist told me that he has PTSD. I was shocked but just nodded and said OK. I didn't ask any questions. Considering what I've read about it since this morning a lot of his behaviours are making much more sense. I know he didn't have a great childhood and has struggled with addiction, anxiety and depression most of his adult life. He is 48 and we have only been together 6 years. I don't know what the trauma was that caused it but to be honest, I really want to ask. I'm not sure if I should ask though.  How can I offer support without seeming overbearing or crossing any personal boundaries? Can anyone offer suggestions as to how I can help? He is the love of my life and seeing him suffer alone is heartbreaking. Thank you.	[]	[{'start': 244, 'end': 257, 'span': 'I was shocked', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

tl;dr: how do you deal in a triggering environment that you cannot escape? or is it impossible and you must just avoid environments such as those? 

details below

tw: very light mention of domestic violence, medical problems, men, fear

background: i (23f) have been through an inordinate amount of trauma, a large sum of it at the hands of angry people and bad men. i’m in great shape but my heart rate usually sits, resting, at around 95+. i’m nearly always in a state of panic, even though i seem externally very relaxed. this continuous level of stress is obviously not good for someone and has actually caused some really severe health problems. that being said, i can’t handle being around trigger right now and i won’t heal in doing so. 

my partner (22m) is a mental health wreck. he has a case of long untreated bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, anger management issues, anxiety disorders, unable to handle stress in any capacity, even a crumb of annoyance will set him off, bouts of delirium, psychosis, history of heavy and severe drug abuse, alcohol abuse, self harm, suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization, five or six inpatient stays with psychiatric hospitals, etc. (all of which can be remedied with counseling and med management but he never stays on it.) (in my defense i rejected his proposal for relationship for about 6 months, knowing i wanted to be alone and heal, but after about a hundred times of “let me take care of you,” “you need somewhere safe i can give you that,” “i’ll be so gentle and kind” etc. i believed him. (do not ever do that, lmao. he put on a really good show) and now we’re stuck together. our financial situation and life circumstance will keep us in the same house together for at least another year. we also have mad history and depth so it’s not the easiest thing to uncouple from. he’s currently in counseling and it’s helpful, but only so. 

situation: that all being said... i can’t handle being around his constant negativity and anger anymore... he rages a lot, slams stuff, curses, says mean things about things and people, it’s so toxic and terrible i shake everytime he’s home. he does it in the morning too, complaining about EVERYTHING. if we’re out of toilet paper it’s “of COURSE there’s no F***ING tp, oh my GOD.” when all he has to do is grab a roll from the cupboard and put it on... it’s literally everything. all the time. i can’t keep being in fight or flight mode constantly it’s actually literally medically killing me. i can’t live like this. i was in a relationship before w a man that had anger problems, and anytime he became upset like i showed above, i would end up badly injured so it’s a very potent and literal trigger that’s constantly happening. i’m sick to my stomach even right now. my dog is scared. all the time. i can’t take that. my dog. 

question: what can i do to protect and help myself? how do i bring my heart rate down? calm myself in his terror? earbuds? what else? what can i do for ME in this situation to help? i’m honestly thinking we’ll have to quietly prepare ourselves to separate in the YEAR at least it’ll take to be able to do that, but in the meantime... do i just avoid him? is it possible to heal and thrive in a triggering environment? as someone w ptsd so severe, do i deal or do i just avoid that environment entirely?

5c73d2817ed3a70001fc2929	52_ptsd	"A poem about my experience. Hi everyone,

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*but I did not comprehend.*

*Jacket-less, I shivered as the rain began pouring.*

*The memory fades.* 

*I came back to myself.*

*The blood cried out the horror,*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*It cried these things to me and many more.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions* 

*with no one there to answer them.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My mom, my brother, my step-father waiting.*

*Mom sobbing as we embraced.* 

*The bullet pierced my heart again*

*My father was not the only one shot that day.*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

*The car stopped, and the dam broke.*

*Blood, tears, and terror erupted from within.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I understand now, truth at a bitter price,*

*that fear is a sacred thing*

*and always has been and always will be.*

*The world was a Different place there.*"	[]	[{'start': 149, 'end': 216, 'span': ' my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 340, 'end': 660, 'span': ' I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down.

So last night my bf who lives an hour and a half away told me he wasn't feeling well and then the last text I received was around 7:30pm. We see each other on the weekends and once or twice during the week. When we're apart it is extremely rare for me to go more than an hour or two without hearing from him. After 2 to 3 hrs I start panicking. My brain goes to all the what ifs in the book! In this scenario I knew he was sick and probably just went to sleep, I kept telling myself this but when 10pm came around and I still hadn't heard from him I laid awake worrying. Finally fell asleep around 1:30am with the help of my dogs reassuring snuggles. At 5:30 I woke to no messages sigh. 7am I go to work...Still no messages. After my 8am meeting I anxiously checked my phone still no messages. So I called him...nothing. Called on fb messenger...nothing! Finally, around 8:30 he texted me that he was still sick and had been sleeping with his phones ringer off. I about cried with relief. My body was a wreck by this time. Heart beating fast, stomach flip flopping! Mind racing! Can anyone relate?! I always think, back in the days before texting this scenario wouldn't even have been a thing but now with instant expectations it's hard not to fret when a loved one ""disappears"" on us.

Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.

I wanted to share here because this sub looked so supportive and because something has been plaguing me for a while. I just decided to make a new account since I couldn't hold this in any longer.  
Trigger warning for some; child sexual abuse, crude jokes  
I recently went through an involuntary hospitalization (related to perceived suicidal ideation) and some of my typical behaviours and quirks caused a psychologist to take me aside and ask if I potentially had PTSD. I assumed she wanted this information to diagnose me or put it on my precautions sheet\*. While curious, I prompted her to share why she thought so, and she replied with, ""I noticed you've been very startled at loud noises throughout the day. At times, you would stare into space and that concerned me."" Now, I was curious. Although I had a fair share of PTSD-knowledge, I mostly comforted myself with the fact that a lot of them are veterans and just...nullified the possibility of me having it.   
Now, the quirks I demonstrated were, as aforementioned, me jumping at loud noises and loud voices, being sensitive to touch, and also a strange blanking out. I don't remember what one would call it, but it strikes me as a whelming of thoughts about my ""trauma"" (which I'll explain below) and I can't help it when I'm in it. I feel like I'm there, but I don't hallucinate about it. It's just all the feelings of it, and it feels *terrible* when I have these spouts. I don't know if flashbacks are like this, but I'll read more around this sub and try to pinpoint the exact definition of whatever a flashback feels like.   
So, my trauma. To put it short, I was raped by two guys (one over the age of consent, and the other almost there) at the age of 11. When I was 13, I was molested by an uncle. I'm 16 now. I've just been trying to deal with it by...joking. That's the only coping mechanism I have. I, at times, even joke about my trauma. Once, I joked about how I ""need to keep my grades up, otherwise, I'd just be a sex doll."" It hurts, though. I can't stop thinking about how the incident was and sometimes I'm a ball of tears because of it.   
So, what do you guys think? Should I just get over it, or do I have PTSD? Or do I have something entirely different? Thank you so much for reading.

I need to vent to someone who understands. 

I have C-PTSD from prolonged childhood trauma. It’s been a terrible struggle to keep my shit together and live as normal of a life as I can.  Several years ago I attempted to go to school to get my degree. 

There, I was raped and beat up at a party. This triggered a downward spiral that led to a suicide attempt that got me kicked out of school. I lost my job, my relationship and ended up homeless for a while. I was a wreck and unable to keep even a simple restaurant job. 

I’ve spent the last few years clawing my way out of this pit. I forced myself to get through a shitty retail job even if it meant vomiting and crying every day before work. It was fucking hell. I only made it due to the kindness of some wonderful people. Sheer gratitude that someone cared enough to try to help me gave me what I needed to make it. 

Today, I have a career I am proud of. I am almost entirely out of debt. I am in a healthy and stable relationship. Until tonight I felt like I was finally moving on with my life. 

Today, I took a big step and decided to go back to school and take one class. Part of enrollment involves watching a graphic video about sexual assault, harassment and domestic abuse. 

I was completely taken off guard by how upset this video made me. I started sobbing in the middle of Starbucks. It was humiliating. 

My partner was really sweet and made me feel a bit better with a mix of r/corgi videos and hugs. But I just can’t shake it. I’m shaking right now. I am having flash backs and intense hyper vigilant reactions. 

I feel like someone just kicked me off a ledge and I am so angry. I’m angry that this is the establishments response to the nightmare I went through. I am angry that I was dismissed and discarded in my time of need. I am angry that I am forced to relive it as part of the price of admission to get my life back. And most of all, I am angry at myself for being so fragile. I am scared that everything I have worked for could be gone in an instance and I could be back on the street. I don’t know what to do.

I know she comes from a place of love, but she has always been short-fused and highly temperamental if something doesn't work out the way she planned it. I have tried my best to coordinate plans with her, but she always ends up frustrated about the lack of communication I seem to have on my part and then makes condescending comments about my character that include: inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, and self consumed.    I have tried to talk to her openly about this, but it always comes back as an attack on my character and I have never heard these comments from anyone else before.

We try to keep him entertained by carrying cards around for when he starts acting up so we can get him to focus on something else. The day camp administrator has told us not to yell at him because he will zone out and not listen, so we just talk in a calm voice. However, other kids see the treatment as unfair.

When I was initially given Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare, the diagnosis was bipolar. Personally, I believe that this diagnosis was given to me, so that I could get the federal benefits. But that diagnosis, from 5 years ago, is what other doctors seem to make their decisions off as well.

I don't have mania or elevated moods. I'm terrified of intimacy due to being molested as a child, which causes my depression. I need to describe this better on my next visit.

I've taken bipolar meds some years before, for probably a year. Aside from feeling weighed down, it didn't seem to do much for me.

Gonna take the bipolar meds now, my next appointment is in 4 weeks."	[]	[{'start': 454, 'end': 481, 'span': 'being molested as a child, ', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
5c73d2817ed3a70001fc2929	69_ptsd	"Paranoia about Being Bullied Again So I took CBD today and it calmed me down mentally to allow me to be more conscious of all the thoughts I have. I realized (what I already knew, but now more so than before) that I always feel like people are laughing at me and judging me. I noticed that when I was walking on the sidewalk today that I had all this mental dialogue going on (almost like schizophrenia) hearing all the imagined voices of the people driving past me making fun of me and laughing at me. Laughing at what I wore, laughing at my face, laughing at my walk. I was afraid that one of them would be someone I knew or worse, one of the people who bullied me.

So for the first time I truly acknowledged my anxiety and asked why I felt this way....by doing so I confirmed a belief I previously only partly held.

*It is that because I was bullied by so many people (like 15) (ostracized, yelled at, made fun of and told constantly that no one liked me) that it must have been my fault, or else why would so many people mistreat me and even the ones that didnt partake just allow the abuse to happen and even become friends with these people? If they were really doing something wrong surely no one would willingly befriend bullies or not stand up to them when it happened everyday right? Because everyone knew it was going on, they all saw. It must be my fault of this allowed to happen. So I thought that since I caused it, there is something about me that will cause this to happen with other people aswell. Thus i see everyone as a potential bully, and no self talk changed the anxiety when I was out today***

I saw someone I knew and though she smiled at me I shut down and after our conversation I just wanted to go home and I wasn’t even present the entire time, my mind kept going back to memories of being yelled at and made fun of the whole conversation even though she was laughing with me. I kept going numb because I felt like if I emotionally checked out, then any bullying that I expected on her part wouldn’t affect me because I wasn’t emotionally there in the first place. All of which I became aware of is something that always happens but cbd made me more conscious of it, it made me more conscious of things that had already been there but I just ignored/I had been denying because I didn’t want to accept that I was mentally ill. 

So how do I, I guess stop thinking that I was at fault for being bullied, or even if I WAS doing something wrong that they just exaggerated my flaws and that I am not a monster that will just be rejected and made fun of by everyone across the board?"

I always get episodes of hypervigilance and extreme aggressiveness. I'm always looking for a threat, thinking ""If this guy looks funny at me I'm gonna rip his face off "". Of course I don't want to hurt anyone and have never done so in my adult life. 
I call this my ""fight mode"". 

I  have the suspicion that quitting my meds messed with my hormone levels or something. That I put on a significant amount of muscle mass while simultaneously losing fat, which shouldn't really be possible at my training level points in that direction. Are maybe my testosterone levels too high? Or is that really just in my mind? 

These hypervigilant states are extremely exhausting.  I usually let this excessive energy out through training, often to the point where I accept injury as a side effect.

5c73d2817ed3a70001fc2929	48_ptsd	"How can i help my 16year old friend with PTSD Hey folks so heres the deal,

Background: my 16 year old friend just came out about sexual and physical abuse from her asshole father 2 months ago. There is an ongoing complex intense court battle between the 2 of them and her family (who admittedly have always been distant) have chosen to side with the father and isolate/ostracize my friend. She has been on and off again homeless, and because of this, she made the healthy decision to move in with me and has become apart of my family. 
I love my friend, she desperately wants to overcome this but is struggling with a lot of symptoms, and myself and my parents want to learn how to help her any way we can. 
She has these dreams where she wakes up panicking and sweating. Last time she told me that she couldnt stop going over what happened in her head, and although i stayed with her, it took a long time for her to fall back asleep.
She also has flashbacks where she goes in and out of the present and past. For example last week after volleyball she was triggered by the noisy change room and ended up standing in the corner unresponsive to anyone repeating the words ""its my fault"". I ended up getting her alone away from the rest of the team but i need strategies on how to get her out of the flashback. Ive noticed that when shes a present the hypersensitivity kicks in and everythings crazy loud for her but then she cant hear anything when shes back in her flashback. Sometimes it helps to give a hug or hold her hand sometimes it terrifies or irritates her. I dont know how to get her out of it and i hate to see her that terrified. 
The hypersensitivity can be super hard too around the house, sometimes shes able to say that something like the dryer is too loud otherwise we'll find her in the corner of her room with her head between her legs in a panic attack. 
We desperately want strategies to help bring her out of a flashback/dissociation, panic attack, night terrors and just the general feeling of loneliness and betrayal she deals with daily. Also note we just started her with a counsellor who she says is helping a lot, this is just for at home and school. Really and insight into ptsd would be super helpful as were all still trying to comprehend it.

It takes me so long to realise that that is what's happening. But I don't know how to stop it. How do I create any relationships (friends, partner etc) that aren't like this anymore.

5c73d2817ed3a70001fc2929	73_ptsd	So im 17 and I had a spinal AVM So about a year ago (September 18th to be exact) I was having some back pain. That pain escalated and after i tried getting up my legs weren't able to hold my body weight. After my dad tried to help me move around thinking it was a pinched nerve and he ended up getting me to the couch. He had me moving my legs up and down like i was marching while sitting hoping that would do something but all it did was keep me focused on the fact that more time went on the less i was able to use my legs and the less i could feel them at all. It happened in the spand of an hour. But i was off to the hospital and that kinda fades in and out. The last thing i remember was that damned room right before you go into surgery. Next thing i know is that im in urgent care and i cant feel my legs or move them at all. I have about a 6 inch incision on my back witb staples in and my family are in the room waiting for me to wake up. Fast forward to now. Im walkin and my feeling is not exactly up to par but its way better than what it was. Im coming up on the anniversary of it and I've been losing sleep rewatching everything that happened. All those memories and emotions flood back into my head and everytime i feel so scared just like when it all happened. So i thought id share. Not 100% if this counts as ptsd but im not sure what else to call it.
