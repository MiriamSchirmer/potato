665aeb269f26520c4307e656	248_ptsd	"Everything triggers flashbacks, crying every day I’m 23 years old, and last year in April my 15 year old brother hung himself in his closet. 
We were best friends, partners in crime. We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. 
I was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn’t feel like I was getting better. 
I was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn’t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. 
I saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I’m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. 
I’ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. 
My medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. 
It’s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can’t handle my grief, I can’t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It’s absolutely horrible. 
I’m a hairdresser and I’ll have clients say certain words to me like “hang” “closet” “died/death” “brother” or make jokes about suicide even though it’s completely out of context I’ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It’s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don’t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. 
I hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can’t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. 
It is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I’m not ready to explain to the people around me what I’m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. 
It’s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don’t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. 

I can’t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I’m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn’t like me. Advance on getting over that fear would be so appreciated because I KNOW I need some serious therapy right now and my family tells me all the time. Does anyone have any good skills in these areas? Please help me. I’m suffering and I know damn well I can’t go through the rest of my life like this. 

TLDR — My baby brother committed suicide last year, and I ended up developing PTSD from it; I have been having extreme flashbacks and my therapist stopped treating me due to my diagnosis.

665aeb269f26520c4307e656	253_ptsd	"Anyone here actually responsible for their trauma? **Yes, there's a TL;DR at the end. Sorry for the essay.**

**Backstory:** I was diagnosed with PTSD years ago. I then developed panic disorder and other issues. Less than a year ago, I was re-evaluated and the persisting symptoms that were originally attributed to PTSD were instead attributed to a different diagnosis. I initially straight up refused to accept the new diagnosis as it was made by an external therapist who didn't and still doesn't really know me. I still am not convinced I fit the criteria for it, and the more I read about it the more I suspect some of my traits and behaviours were grossly misinterpreted and 'bent' to fit the criteria. PTSD is still what makes the most sense to me. Hence why I'm posting here for now. 

About a month ago I was in a really dark place and didn't know what to do to help myself. I created this account and joined this sub, the CPTSD sub, and the sub dedicated to my current diagnosis. I was hoping I could either come to terms with my new diagnosis or find more evidence that I might have been misdiagnosed to use as future reference, once I'll be able to choose my own therapist. 

I can't say I achieved any of that. I feel lost, confused, trapped. But after a month+ of lurking, reading, trying to make sense of things I did figure out the number one factor preventing me from feeling like I fit in - here or in any of the three subs. I believe it's the fact that I'm completely responsible for my trauma. 

And no, I am not a victim of abuse convinced it was their fault. My trauma was objectively my fault. It wasn't intentional, I didn't mean for it to  happen. But it did, and it was my fault. 

I guess when I joined I was really hoping to find even just a few people with a similar 'profile' as me, somewhere on Reddit. No such luck thus far. 

**TL;DR:**
Is there anyone else here, PTSD diagnosed or not, who can objectively say the trauma they experienced and have been suffering from was the direct cause of their own actions? 

Whether intentional or not. 

I am honestly desperate to find people that can understand this guilt. I feel very alone rn. Please, do reach out if you can identify with this. If you don't want to out yourself commenting, I understand. Please consider DMing me. I am a good listener. You don't even have to tell me your story, I understand it can be shameful and painful.

665aeb269f26520c4307e656	459_ptsd	"I'm back in therapy and it was probably the best decision I could have made. Hello, all. I've been reflecting on the events of 2017, what with it being the new year and all, and I just wanted to share a little of my happiness with everyone. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years back because of extended trauma going back from elementary school all the way through to college. When I was diagnosed, I had actually sought out therapy for depression but due to some conversations with friends and the things I was currently studying in my Stress and Trauma class (I was a psych major) I realized that I fit almost every symptom listed for the PTSD diagnosis as well. 

I had been receiving therapy through my university's health program which allowed for a certain number of free visits every semester. But then my therapist left the university clinic and went into private practice. I continued to see her, but I couldn't afford the insurance copay and eventually stopped my visits altogether. On paper the fees were reasonable, but all my financial info was based on the fact that I was technically still considered my mom's dependent. In reality, she only paid for my insurance and I was living in poverty while trying to go to school because I was receiving pretty much no help from my family and couldn't find work. 

From then until just a few months ago, I wasn't receiving any treatment for my mental health issues. Last year was rather hellish for me. I was in a much better situation financially, I lived in a better apartment, had a job, and in a lot of other ways my life was objectively better. But emotionally, I was suffering. It hadn't been that bad for me since I had escaped the awful home life that traumatized me in the first place.

It took a lot of mental energy in a time where I didn't have much, but at my lowest point I finally researched therapy offices in my area. I got married two years ago and my partner's insurance covers most of the cost. Plus, we're fortunate enough that I can afford it without having to worry about still being able to eat afterwards, unlike when I was in college. So I called and made an appointment. 

That was back in October. I'm now going through CPT (cognitive processing therapy). It's really fucking hard, but so far it has absolutely been worth it. I'm putting a lot more time and effort into improving myself. I've been much more productive. I'm doing things I used to love again. Things that used to seem a distant dream or completely unachievable now feel like they might be things I can tackle - if not now, then *someday*. I'm more hopeful than I've probably ever been. My partner has been unbelievably supportive and has said they're really proud of me for all the work I've been doing. 

I'm not quite there, yet. It's still a struggle. But I'm making it. I feel like I can do this. And I hope that all of you reading this can claim some happiness for yourselves, too. 

Much love ~

TL;DR: I have gone untreated for over three years and just got back into therapy a few months ago. Already it's made a big difference and I feel like I'm getting my life back.

It’s only been a year and a half since I discovered I had repressed my father’s sexual abuse. I pretty much blanked on much of my early life before going to school; my elementary years were marked by extreme fear and neuroticism; from junior high on I was numb and depressed. Understanding my father now as a pedophile, narcissist, and abuser has been the missing key to explaining so much about my life. Now I’m trying to recondition my behavior to be adaptive instead of maladaptive, which means piecing together the origins of my fears and anxieties.

As a child, I hated dolls and sought the comfort of stuffed animals instead. As an adult with overt PTSD, I notice I have a heavy preference for non-human animal company. I struggle with some misanthropy. Was my doll phobia related to the sexual abuse? Did I see myself as a doll in some way? I was super triggered by the movie The Exorcist, and as an adult, I see so many commonalities with child sexual abuse.

I also had a phobia of mirrors. Whenever I would brush my teeth, I was terrified that when I looked down to spit and looked back up, my face would be different, or someone would be behind me. As an adult, I realize I never had a stable sense of self. My existence was always conditional (on appeasing my abuser). And I wasn’t allowed to have my own will, not when it conflicted with his. As I’ve become more comfortable with myself, mirrors scare me less. This one makes sense to me.

The cockroach one can probably be explained by some traumatic instances with roaches. I remember being at Fuddruckers, there being a cockroach on the wall and me being concerned but my family ignoring me, and later the cockroach being in my burger. Things get foggy after that... I don’t remember if I took a bite of the burger. Another possibility is that my father abused me in a roach-infested place, like the office building he forced us to work in. I remember having to spend nights there and being terrified of the giant flying roaches. 

Has anyone been able to figure out their childhood phobias? I also had some OCD behavior in the bathroom, like counting down from flushing the toilet and washing my hands, or getting up from the bath to dry off and get dressed— I had to do it within the countdown otherwise “the monsters would get me.”"	[]	[{'start': 0, 'end': 1419, 'span': 'Phobias - Dolls, Mirrors, Roaches TW: child sexual abuse\r\n\r\nIt’s only been a year and a half since I discovered I had repressed my father’s sexual abuse.

665aeb269f26520c4307e656	1220_ptsd	"A poem about my experience. Hi everyone,

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*but I did not comprehend.*

*Jacket-less, I shivered as the rain began pouring.*

*The memory fades.* 

*I came back to myself.*

*The blood cried out the horror,*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*It cried these things to me and many more.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions* 

*with no one there to answer them.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My mom, my brother, my step-father waiting.*

*Mom sobbing as we embraced.* 

*The bullet pierced my heart again*

*My father was not the only one shot that day.*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

*The car stopped, and the dam broke.*

*Blood, tears, and terror erupted from within.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I understand now, truth at a bitter price,*

*that fear is a sacred thing*

*and always has been and always will be.*

*The world was a Different place there.*"	[]	[{'start': 150, 'end': 516, 'span': 'my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression.

I'd fought them for years, and hadn't had them nearly as often lately -- or when I did, I  wasn't remembering them anymore, thank goodness. I recently got a secondary PTSD diagnosis related to medical surgeries/bone setting, and it has really kicked up my PTSD symptoms. Flinching from loud noises, contact, nightmares, anxiety, constant fear. 

With the new secondary  medical PTSD diagnosis -- the nightmares have come back, are violent, and are atrocious. Was up and down all night, and finally slept around 6AM.  And then I finally slept, and WOW. The nightmares. 

Was with a group of really shady people, and we were on some kind of late night mission. It all felt natural though, because I used to socialize with  some pretty shady people... -sighs- Don't ask. Just trying to get this out of my head so that I can shake reliving them in my head. Basically trekked with them to this unknown house, late at night, and everything went super south, super fast. 

The people I was with -- they murdered a woman that used to be my friend. I mean, I got held back, tied up, and told I needed to watch this. It was like being apart of the Manson/Tate murders, without being included. And I like... watched her, her husband, and her three children, get murdered by these shady people. I didn't... *do* anything. I *couldn't*... do anything. I felt the helplessness. The inability to do anything. I hate my brain. 

I think it was guilt. We had a  falling out a few years back over drug use. She got sick, and needed a heart transplant, and died less than a year after the transplant. She passed away a couple years ago, after a heart transplant failed to take.  She only had two kids. It felt so real. Like I hadn't seen her in so long, and in that time, she'd had another kid...

Three kids. Her  and her husband. Still hearing the damned screams. I don't remember it all -- but I definitely remember the screams. The blood. Stabbing. I started to realize it was a dream, and I was screaming. ""WAKE UP! WAKE  UP, IT'S NOT REAL. SHE DIED. I KNOW SHE DIED, WAKE UP."" I swore I was screaming in my sleep like I used to. I woke up abruptly, rolled out of bed, and just stared at the wall, breathing hard. It was bad. I forgot all about just how bad the night terrors are. They've been bad the past few weeks -- but this one... just... I can't shake it, and I'm still tearing up. Brutal."

At least that’s how it felt to me. My parents had me when they were very young. My dad was a drug dealer and my mom was fifteen. I was a premature baby and since my parents were kids, my grandmother (my moms mother) was practically raising me a lot of the time. But my parents resented me for something they allowed to happen. They tried to make it so I couldn’t see her but when they wanted to go out well they would stop saying that. I would always get caught in the middle of their fights, glasses getting thrown, some even hit me, getting knocked over, getting screamed at for being in the room when they were fighting. And then it got worse. Whenever I tried to Hug my parents they’d either tell me to go away or they’d ask me what I wanted and push me out of the way. They’d tell me they never wanted me. They got older and when I was seven had another kid. And overtime three more. My parents stopped with the non legal stuff but they still constantly had their issues with each other, and whenever they didn’t get along they would take it out on me. I was grounded for months at a time for no reason, everything taken out of my room. Sometimes even locked in. And I was a pretty good child. I was just really sad. Just wanted a family. In middle school I tried really hard to get away. I went to the police and showed them the bruises told them of the horror I was living, but since I was in an upper class family they said I had it good and I should be grateful. I’m transgender which is another reason they just really didn’t like me. One time when I went to the police my mom threw herself into a cabinet and said I threw her, and I ended up having to go through the legal system as a very naive autistic innocent kid who wouldn’t hurt a fly. I was constantly just told I wasn’t wanted, pushed, hit, and when I ran away on my 18th birthday they made me feel like a monster for leaving. And the rest of my family says that it wasn’t abuse. That I had a good childhood. But I remember laying in my bed begging to either die or get another family.

665aeb269f26520c4307e656	420_ptsd	"Possible trauma from hospitalization, and people think I need to get over it. I was 21 at the time, now I'm 22. In May of 2017, I got really sick out of no where. In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. 

At 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. 

The doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said ""what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?"" I said I didn't know what was wrong. 

After they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. 

They discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a ""nasty fever"" and told me to rest for a few days.

At 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. 

Positive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.

Being septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. 

I returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). 

Now I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. 

I constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit.

665aeb269f26520c4307e656	2330_counseling	My wife and I are newly married, about 2 months. We've had some issues surrounding sex, particularly her lack of libido. She's on an anxiety medication, of which diminished libido is a side effect, but I think our issue is also partly one of a lack of intimacy/romance centered around my hectic schedule. Our sex life has suffered as a result. Tonight she made a genuine effort to let me know she wanted sex, which is a big deal. Once things started, she had the most obviously fake orgasm I've ever encountered. I was honest with her about why, and told her that the most important thing to me in sex was knowing that she was legitimately enjoying it. She responded angrily with a complete denial of the faking. I don't know how to broach this subject and have an honest conversation. I think she will continue to lie to me about faking it which will cause our sex life to spiral further. Please help.

So I got my PTSD after i got t-boned in a car accident. I thought I was going to be fine as I was recovering, but the stress from my family and past relationships seemed to make me develop ptsd. The first year i was just really disabled and lost interest in everything. the next two years i decided to get more mobile, but then i had anger attacks and anxiety attacks (even when i wasn't angry, something i had no idea could happen before that).

So this year I started getting therapy, something i SHOULD have done a long long time ago. Things have been going good so far. I keep improving and I have days where i actually feel positive.

The hardest part still, it just like... getting physically active in order to do daily thing. There are still days where I wake up and my body feels like shit (not like how when i had anxiety attacks, just a general kind of shit).

5f3292eb017ff806022a9b22	408_ptsd	"This feels so minor after writing it but I need to get it out. While taking a practice LSAT, I had a question come up that triggered a flashback. It threw me off for the rest of my test... this feels like such a set back. I had to abandon my career associated with my undergrad degree after being blackballed from the industry by a scheming boss lady and the pond scum of a coworker who assaulted me and mentally and emotionally messed with me. After a year of suffering anxiety, depression, flash backs, nightmares, and various SN responses to certain places, people, thoughts, I’ve had the chance to process and work through via therapy and journaling. 

I made my decision to pursue a law degree that I was on the fence about. The LSAT is ranked out of 180 points with a 165 being high enough to get you in to most schools. The first LSAT practice exam I took I scored a 152. This last one, I hit a question that stated in quotations something that was said to me upon my termination, and I dove deep into memory lane. My mind started racing and I felt flighty and nervous all of a sudden and started rushing through the test just wanting to escape. I didn’t complete that section and did horrendous on what should’ve been my best session. I only got a 142. 

Of course these are just practice exams and not the end all be all; however, my GPA is not too great considering I spent most of my final semester coping... I need that high score to get in to law school. 

I’m so scared that something like this will happen on the actual test day next month. I’ve never been set off by something so small before and thought I was doing significantly better- even my therapist has increased the time between our sessions. I’m mad at myself because this is still getting to me. I don’t want them to have control over me any longer and I sure as heck do not want this to put another career in jeopardy for me. 

I never want another intrusive thought. I just want to process and move on."	[]	[{'start': 297, 'end': 443, 'span': 'blackballed from the industry by a scheming boss lady and the pond scum of a coworker who assaulted me and mentally and emotionally messed with me', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

My SO has been really distant with everyone he knows lately and it began to worry me and everyone else. I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his ""voice"". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend ""Jay's"" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.

The next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with ""Jay"". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.

Back when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. 



I knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. 


Earlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a ""shooting in the woods"" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. 

And then this happened.

I'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.

I don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know."

It was about a year ago and lasted probably six months, and I keep having flashbacks to that time, with many different triggers. I have also been dissociating really badly, as in constantly, for the past few months because I was triggered badly right before. I feel like it doesn’t count because ptsd is such a serious illness and it wasn’t any kind of cut and dry traumatic event, and what if I’m just being silly and these sorts of flashbacks are just normal? Does anyone have a similar situation or any words of advice? I’m talking to my therapist about it and since she’s a bipolar specialist I think I might look elsewhere to look for a diagnosis or other treatment. Thanks for reading :)

Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it ""rape"" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.


 At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).


I hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be ""real raped, choked"" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.


2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming ""OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP"" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.


Over the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???


TL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick ""fetish"". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."

5f3292eb017ff806022a9b22	806_ptsd	"Is this ptsd? So to preface, I had an accident last year that involved me breaking my shoulder. I knocked the humeral head off the shaft and it was hanging together by the muscle. I then broke it two more times in the span of six months. The third time was a surgery where they had to break it and pin/plate it together after a malunion. 

Ever since surgery I’ve had several severe nightmares. Lately they’ve become a nightly occurrence. I feel the pain all over again, and I wake up crying/in a panic. Anytime I hear a plane flying I get very nauseous and I feel like I’m gonna pass out. A plane had caused my horse to panic and they threw me off, causing the initial break. The thought of even getting on a horse again is impossible, but I was raised around them. When I see my scar from surgery (the doctor left my staples in too long and my skin grew over some of them, causing more scarring), I feel very very upset. I can’t wear tank tops anymore because I just can’t stand seeing it. I haven’t told my therapist about this (I’m in therapy for other mental issues) because this all feels silly. 

Four of the eight therapists I’ve been to have mentioned that they want me to get tested or whatever for ptsd because of other things that have happened in my life.

5f3292eb017ff806022a9b22	103_ptsd	"I am a college student and I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment. Help Long story, but read if you can. 

I came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. 

About a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. 

Lots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. 

The day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. 

I woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear ""COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said ""one sec"" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. 

During this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. 

The main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.

I explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. 

After the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. 

I showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. 

Since I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. 

It got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. 

Do I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. 

I miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. 

anything will help. "	[]	"[{'start': 1173, 'end': 1450, 'span': '\r\n\r\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door.

5f3292eb017ff806022a9b22	344_ptsd	"Did I have a marijuana induced episode? Hi all!

New member here. 
Basically went through some very rough stuff throughout childhood and witnessed very scary domestic abuse between my parents. Lots of yelling (my dad can be very scary) hitting in front of me, etc.
To this day my parents are still married and the physical fighting has subsided, yet they will still get into a yelling/ door slamming match every now and then that just sends me into tears despite being 20 years old. I still hate all forms of yelling/voice raising. Even when my mom is just calling a sibling from the other room, I shudder at the sound of just her yelling. 

The other night, I was smoking with my sister and her friends. I used to be a frequent smoker, nearly everyday mostly and every single day occasionally for a few months here and there, mostly to deal with depression and such. However we were taking dabs, which I have taken before without this effect, but clearly I got much more high a lot quicker than from a bowl or blunt. Anyway, I proceeded to go lay on the couch in my basement and I SWORE I could hear my dad clear as day screaming at my mom. I knew I was super high and scared, but over and over I would hear his voice in my head. I went upstairs and checked, they were completely fast asleep.

Was this some form of ptsd that was triggered by being high? Is this possible? I just felt so scared and my heart was beating extremely hard at the sheer thought of my dad yelling. Thanks guys"	[]	[{'start': 68, 'end': 194, 'span': '\r\nBasically went through some very rough stuff throughout childhood and witnessed very scary domestic abuse between my parents', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
5f3292eb017ff806022a9b22	2209_ptsd	"Intense (triggered) fear of drugs I have no idea where to post this, and I’m even sure I have ptsd I just don’t know how to deal with this. When I was in middle school my older brother got into drugs and became a heroin addict shortly after. My mother would cry everyday and act coldly toward me and my little brother. She would go on fits of panic hyperventilating and pacing through our whole house and saying stuff like “please god just take my life instead of his”. My dad would scream at my older brother horrible things and I don’t blame him because my brother was horrible. He would steal things like my favorite video games and pawn them for drug money and I was too scared of upsetting my parents so I wouldn’t tell them. I loved my brother so much I wanted to protect him even though he was ruining my life. I would find his burnt spoons and pills and just sob all night. I watched him but drugs from weird cars in front of our house when I’d get home from school. Sometimes the drug cars would sit outside my house when I was home alone and I was so scared and confused. I would walk past his room and he would be sitting still with a blank expression staring at one corner of his room like a zombie. He actually overdosed and was dead until he was resuscitated in the ER. My parents would pay for different rehabs and they never worked. My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house. I felt so alone I would cut myself and make myself throw up or I would hysterically cry randomly at school or with friends. I wanted to just get in a car accident or find the courage to kill myself. I couldn’t ever get help or tell my family because it would make the situation worse. All I wanted was for my mom to hug me and say everything was going to be okay. 

Now I’m 19 and he’s doing much better. He seems to be clean but you can never really be sure, but he seems much happier. But I am left with this scar that I don’t think will ever go away. I fear drugs of any kind, I fear alcohol, I fear it all. Being around people doing those things make me panic on the inside. I do a good job usually of hiding it, but then I go home and cry. It’s hard when everyone I know my age does all sorts of drugs and drinks. I’ve lost friends, It’s caused a breakup. I avoid movie scenes with drug use because it makes me that sick to my stomach and memes or people talking about drugs absolutely ruin my day. The thought of my boyfriend smoking or drinking still disturbs me greatly and makes me cry, but I don’t want to control him. I know people use these things to find peace but I don’t know why and it makes me so intensely upset. I wish I could protect everyone from these things but I can’t. I know i sound crazy. I don’t cry as much anymore. Sometimes the urge to hurt myself returns but I do well at suppressing that. I don’t know if this is ptsd or if this was considered trauma I don’t know anything I just know I feel hopeless."

He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too.  He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since.  Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can’t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual.  Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time.  He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything.

I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7"" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2"" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.

Fast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  

Another episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.

I know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.

Sorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.

**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**

i went way overboard with this girl, we connected early
ok and so i asked her to hang out,

would turn to her during tough times,
talked to her about God because we shared that same faith, one day i sent her a super long message about it and it made things awkward... she backed away.

this guy who doesn't like me is an atheist... 

I used to leave my backpack in the break room usually, and this has been a concern.

my coworkers aren't too fond of me, that's also another reason.

is it likely that my food was being tampered with/drugged? I've left my backpack in the non-surveillance break room for a full year before leaving it somewhere more safe.

To be clear, I'm concerned about only the past year and resolving that. Anything you could share to alleviate these concerns would be appreciated.

I was with this girl for three years and we had a house together, pets, you name it. Well we started fighting a lot and she had self harm issues. Our fights would start out small and next thing you know, we were screaming in the house, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg. She would lock herself in a room and try to cut herself in the middle of these fights, so I would break into the room to stop her (my mind immediately shifting to I'm not fighting with her anymore, I'm going to try and stop her and show her I love her), but she never let up. She would resort to brutally beating me in the face to get me away from her and say the most horrible things to me. She would tell me I was a loser, I was ugly, fat, and all sorts of things that I refuse to remember. I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts. I lied to my friends and said that I got my black eye from work. I remember one time specifically was at AWA, and all of my friends that were there, surrounded me and wouldn't leave me alone about my black eye, which wasn't the first one. I lied to them again and then I told them I had to pee, and went to the bathroom and cried really hard. Fast forward to the end, a couple of years ago. I had a concussion at work. I fell into a running compactor and hit my head, and my boss saved my life. I completely forgot the previous two months, including my sister getting engaged and everything. They wouldn't let me drive or watch movies or anything until I recovered. It was a nightmare. Well I started getting my memory back and she started a fight with me because my friend was coming to see me and she ""wanted to do her workout."" it escaladed very quickly to the same routine as before only this time I broke a statue that we got together and I threw the flowers I got her on the floor and the cops were called again and said one of us had to leave for the night. She kicked me out and broke up with me and never let me come back. I couldn't drive at the time she made me stay outside until my mom came and got me. I begged her not to do it, because I was in love with her despite everything and she treated me like a criminal and condemned me. She tried to turn all of my friends against me (which failed horribly for the most part) and told everyone that I was the one abusing her. I never touched her like that and I never said anything so horrible to her. I treated her like gold 95% of the time and I cared about her more than anything. I left her a long letter on the porch a week after all of this, explaining how much she meant to me and that I wanted a new start with her and she called the cops to tell me to leave her alone and told everyone that I was a psycho.

It went from restricting myself at 14 to only eating \~1000 calories a day to binging and purging weekly for the next 8 years. 6 months before my trauma, I decided to end it. I started eating more and healthier and lifting weights instead of the \~80 minutes of cardio a day I was doing. I felt amazing.

Then the trauma happened, and fitness was one of the interests I lost when the depression and PTSD hit. I couldn't sleep and had a very busy schedule, so I relied on (mainly junk) food to get me through all-nighters and long shifts. This turned to a comfort thing where I would down Ben and Jerry's and blame my depression. I couldn't even go back to doing cardio because an elevated heart-rate felt like a panic attack. Unsurprisingly, I gained 15 pounds, which is a lot on my 5'1 body.

It's been a year and some months, and I'm safe again. I have my degree, a job, my own apartment, and stability. Yet all I want to do is lose this weight I gained. I associate it with the worst year of my life and everything in me wants to just go back to the ""old me"" before the trauma and, in hand, the weight gain. Yet I'm so scared this restriction is going to lead to my eating becoming disordered again.

I have tried dieting, but I can't get myself to use calorie tracking apps and when I get too hungry I just...eat. I don't think about my allotted macros for the day or if I'm above or below my protein goal or if the food I'm eating ""fits in my macros"" anymore. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating with no restrictions and I still have my daily fruits and veggies. I'm also still very into weight-lifting and go to the gym 6 days a week still. I guess I just don't have the passion to diet and exercise like I used to for weight loss, though.

I hear all the time about people with PTSD not eating and withering away because of the traumatic event they had to endure. Has anybody else experienced the opposite, though- relying on food to cope? It's hard for me to relate to most stories about PTSD because so many talk about experiencing nausea and an inability to eat - but the only thing I cared about after my trauma was eating.

On the third year, Timothy started exhibited odd behavior. He insinuated he was into illegal porn and stuff like that, but I took it as a joke because he would always joke around all the time. (By now he has my phone number) That went on for the rest of the year. On the fourth year, he would joke around about raping minors every day of the week. He did it for about six months.. then some idiot leaks my first and last name to him and state, so then that makes me paranoid. By then, I block him and I haven’t spoken to him in a year. It’s been a year.. blocked Timothy on all social media, I removed all my online shit, I’m totally ghosted. He never said he would hurt me... and he probably understands why I left.. I think. Maybe not. Anyways. I’ve been having paranoia all year that he’s going to come after me and kill me for leaving the friendship. He never said that though. Is this a form of PTSD? Will he really track me down with my first and last and kill me? His toxic behavior makes me paranoid enough to believe that even though I know he won’t... but I need reassurance. Please help me. I’m tired of being paranoid.

5f3d4bcdf4ed530a5191542e	1535_ptsd	"I think I’m spiraling and I’m angry at my husband who can’t help me (tw mention of abuse, yelling, SA no details) (TW here) I have C-PTSD from a culmination of many things: abusive home situation, rape, and abusive violent romantic relationships.

I was proud to say that I escaped all of that and ended up in a healthy marriage. But I can no longer afford medication or therapy so I’ve been skating by basically.

As a kid, my family gaslighted me into thinking I was a walking disaster. If something broke, it had to be my fault. If I injured myself, obviously it was in character for me. But I am actually a very careful person and I work hard to appear “graceful” (also hyper awareness from my sexual assault - you will never catch me missing a step or tripping on the curb). It was normal in my family for my siblings to break something, blame it on me, and I got the beating and verbal lashing despite my proclaimed innocence.

So yesterday I had a cooking disaster. I damaged an expensive piece of cookware - but only aesthetically. It still works fine but it is no longer beautiful. I told my husband because it triggered me. I felt like I was falling into that family trap and had berated myself for an hour (I’m stupid and careless and clumsy and don’t deserve nice things).

I told my husband and he immediately starts lecturing me on how I shouldn’t have done that. I get emotional, “I know, I know! I feel guilty enough!” But I raised my voice so he started yelling back. I don’t even remember what he said but I felt like he was speaking to a bad dog and not his wife.

We reconciled some time later but the spiral started.

This morning we had a fight. I have a migraine and a lot of work to do. He kept talking to me while I was writing and it made me irritable. So I took a break to watch tv with him. He kept talking during the show. The show + his voice + my migraine made me feel like I was going to lose my mind. I couldn’t process anything. Construction started outside. I reminded my husband that he had to pause if he needed to talk. I asked him to shut the window. 

He lost it and started yelling at me again. That he couldn’t stand my mood. I started crying again, that I couldn’t process all the sounds and he knows this. He just kept yelling that I was bossy, selfish, I had a bad attitude.

I left the room and locked myself in the bedroom. He keeps yelling and slamming the doors. Huge huge trigger.

Now I’m scared and hiding. I have to shower. He’s mad at me and not coming to comfort me. I don’t want to see him and I’m afraid of having to talk because I just feel mute. I have to go to work soon.  I love him
But I don’t feel like I love him right now. I feel like he has been pretending to understand my ptsd. I know I wasn’t rude. I know I don’t deserve the yelling

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

5f3d4bcdf4ed530a5191542e	244_ptsd	Physical symptoms? I got a tentative diagnosis of PTSD at the end of last year by my therapist, and have been going to therapy on and off for a while now. I have nightmares sometimes, and panic attacks pretty often, but I also started passing out and ‘losing time’ and I’m not sure if it’s related to PTSD or if it’s a different thing, so I’m wondering if anyone here has had any related symptoms. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post it, but honestly you guys seem like a good community (this is more or less a throwaway, but I’ve been lurking for a while on another account). And I know that it says no medical advice, and I don’t know if this would really fall into it- I’m seeing a doctor regularly, and I don’t want advice about what to do more than just wanting to know if this is something other people experience. Anyways, when I black out it doesn’t feel at all like a panic attack, my vision goes dark while when I have a panic attack my vision goes bright and everything looks white. Also, during panic attacks I feel over sensitive/ every sense seems alarmingly heightened, but when I pass out it just feels like I completely lose control, everything goes black and I can feel myself falling and then I wake up. Ive checked with my doctor to see if it could be caused by heart problems as they run in the family, but all results came back completely normal. Honestly I didn’t even think of it being related to PTSD until a friend suggested it. Along with passing out, there has also been days where I look at the time and realize that somehow four or five hours passed by without me recalling any of it. I don’t use any substances, and honestly it’s a fairly scary experience and I don’t know if any of you have felt anything like that that ended up being related to PTSD. Thanks in advance!

\-Backstory Time

My mother was married four times, and her third husband, was addicted to pills. I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. 

My mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. 

I know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.

My mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-It's all downhill from here folks.

So how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Almost up to speed

I have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. 

It was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.

I’m going through cognitive behavioral therapy (the writing type) and my therapist told me to hand write everything to prevent dissociation. I’ve heard of dissociation but only the most severe types with fugue or losing time etc. I’ve lost time before but I never really thought about it or even knew what it was until a recent job interview I don’t remember actually doing, just going in and coming out. I’m rambling because of insomnia, sorry. I’ve always done this thing where I sit in the back of my head and dispassionately observe my physical reactions to emotional events. Like even if I’m physically sobbing I don’t feel it in my head if that makes sense, I just watch myself cry and keep analyzing the situation and just sort of ignore my body. Is this dissociation? I don’t want to know what to do about it, I’m going to therapy and she’s amazing, I’ve just got a few days before my next session and I’m curious.

665b4dd16cf3d208d30b59ce	713_ptsd	"Medical/illness related ptsd? So hey, this is something I've been thinking about a lot recently. I'm diagnosed with depression, general anxiety and ocd and take medication. I've had very brief therapy experience and am not currently in therapy but I'm wondering if I should see someone about the possibility of trauma. Sorry if this is a long one but here we go. 

As a child I had a debilitating chronic illness which came on very suddenly and meant I had to leave school and I became bedbound with a lot of pain and mystery symptoms. 'Suddenly' as in my life changed basically overnight. Took a loooong time to diagnose too. I was never admitted to hospital long term but did an extensive pediatric tour and being a kid, didn't really know what was happening, if I'd ever get better, etc. and became almost totally isolated from all my old friends too. I also saw the effect my illness had on my family which was really rough. I've been depressed since childhood but only sought help at age 20 because as a kid I was scared if any doctors knew cps would take me away (reports of kids with depression + my condition being wrongly perceived as a result of abuse) plus I didn't want to cause more pain to my family... Then the secret had been kept too long to spill I guess. I'd always been an anxious child too. I also don't remember much of my childhood but I don't know if there's an abnormal lack of memories. 

I get angry hearing other people with the illness talk about it... I panic and get upset when I think about how I was... The times I've been forced into talking about it/remembering being ill I get very emotional... No one who I've made friends with after getting better knows about my illness and I plan to keep it that way. But I've only heard of medical trauma in like, kids who had cancer or really serious stuff. I don't know if this is a trauma or I'm just oversensitive? and I feel like I can't even tell how much this is affecting my life if that makes sense because I don't want to think about it. I'm used to being extremely repressed but finding the right snri has made more actual emotions creep back into my life lol. I'd just really appreciate any responses and opinions because it's taken a lot to share even this"	[]	"[{'start': 62, 'end': 452, 'span': ""een thinking about a lot recently.

I went to the school with it but they did NOTHING, the fucking principle said ""well he's an honor student with a future ahead of him"". After this happened I went into a derealization episode for 8 months, every single day I would wake up and feel like nothing was real. I was having a major panic attack and I tried to tell a girl from my school I was too freaked out to go back to the school and she said I was overreacting and looked at me like I was crazy.

651473fb2752280b1a749370	1016_ptsd	"From ok to 0 in about 2 seconds I have a bunch of traumatic things that have happened to me while I was growing up (sexual abuse from family members, a long-term emotionally abusive relationship that has thankfully ended, and continually high pressure from my family to perform and has been very verbally abusive).

Previously I’ve been able to cope extremely well and sort of swept all of this under the rug. I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life’s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.

2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I’m seeing therapists but they haven’t put down a diagnosis yet) as I’m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I’ve had to stop work for the moment because I can’t cope.

I am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner’s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.

It’s father’s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven’t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it’s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don’t resolve any issues. And it’s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn’t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it’s taken a full toll on me.

The relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn’t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father’s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad’s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn’t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I’m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I’m terrified about my future and whether I’ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I’m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn’t that good to start with. My parents don’t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).

Right now I don’t feel safe and I don’t know what to do. This post didn’t really have a question - I am just massively triggered right now and want to vent my story anonymously. Thanks for reading."

651473fb2752280b1a749370	125_ptsd	"Girlfriend has a CPTSD diagnosis, but won’t acknowledge it or seek help I wasn’t sure where to post this so I apologise in advance if this isn’t the right place, but was hoping to get some advice from people a better understanding of this.


My girlfriend in the past has received a diagnosis for CPTSD after she experienced a sustained trauma as a child. She told me this early on in our relationship but it has never been mentioned since. 


But I feel that it is still affecting her everyday life in a very significant way. She doesn’t sleep from
nightmares, she’s hyper vigilant at all times, often descends into the deepest sadness for days at a time, says the most awful things about herself, she gets faint, sometimes disassociated or shuts down completely, and is so incredibly anxious most of the time. She just isn’t happy or enjoying her life at all. I have in the past gently suggested that she talk to a therapist, not with direct reference to C-PTSD but because she has told me she wants to die, or because of self harm, and this is met with quite a lot of hostility, saying that I thought she was crazy or just shifting my responsibility as a boyfriend on to a therapist, and it has almost lead to break-ups, so I haven’t suggested it in a while.


Another part of it is that within our relationship when I have made mistakes, nothing that I felt was too major - getting a bit cross, or being late to a meet up, it’s been world shattering for her, sent her spiralling down for days. She told me that sometimes she almost cries when she sees me because of the relief and safety it makes her feel. I was so touched that she felt that way but it also made me realise the responsibility I have, how careful I need to be to not make any slip-ups, and why she finds it so hard to forgive little things - if they’ve made her feel this awful I don’t really blame her. And it also made me realise that I actually never talk about how I’m feeling or if I’m upset, because of fear of upsetting her. There have been times when I’ve felt more like a carer than a boyfriend, I feel awful for saying that but it is how it’s felt. It is beginning to really affect me too and I don’t feel that that is sustainable in a relationship. 


I think that I need to encourage her to seek help,  but to be more upfront and talk about the C-PTSD and how I see her feeling, and to say that I don’t think things can continue with the way they currently are, with her whole world being dependent on me. Because I’ll inevitably slip up from time to time with little things as people do, and I don’t want her to have to feel so so sad when I do. But I do want to be with her, I love her and I want most for her to be happy. But I know that me suggesting this will not go down well. She doesn’t see the symptoms I mentioned as anything more than just situational - she doesn’t like work or she’s just tired. But while the situations have always changed the feelings haven’t. 


What I was hoping was if anyone with more experience of the condition might be able to make clearer is whether I am doing the right thing by suggesting getting help, and if so whether there are specific things I should avoid saying that could make the CPTSD worse, or if there’s a best way to go about it. I don’t want to bring up her old trauma with her anymore than I need to, I really don’t want to upset her with this, but I just don’t feel things are sustainable as they currently are.

It continued to get worse and worse, starting from disciplining for no reason and then at the time they divorced it it got to hitting with a closed fist every night. Then, 4 more years passed and my mom finally got full, but he had visitation every other weekend. As you can probably guess, it got worse.

So yes I've got some serious trauma and all my life i asked myself one question. how can i be happy in my whole being naturally like a baby does? 

  
and I've went through an amazing journey to discover really deep fundamental of life. I've always been a positive and resilient guy and that helped me a lot in my life.

  
but i wanted to create my dreams and one of dreams was to be happy again in my body. i knew that for that to happen i had to find a way to heal these past trauma.

  
My goal was, how can i be able to think and relieve a trauma and be free from the emotional baggage of it because i knew that your life is the reflection of what's inside of you.

  
So here's the step by steps way to do this. warning! trauma can take a while to heal but if you stay consistent with this you will see a really big difference over time and it can be rough to go through this but it is worth it.

  
so the first step is to think about the trauma and then really focus on your whole being (emotions, mental, physical and energical patterns) when you think about the trauma.

  
feel the feelings related to the trauma scale them from 1 to 10, 10 meaning it's the worst feeling ever.now take your two hands in front of you and do this. imagine all these feelings, these beliefs etc... imagine them going into your hands and push them into the universe take a breath wait couple of seconds. 

  
**it doesn't matter if you don't believe it will work. DO IT! for the sake of your happiness!!!**

  
then refocus on the trauma and see how you feel NOW thinking about the same trauma. 

  
scale on 1-10 again (sometimes you can feel the emotions spiking up it is alright just continue this process.)

  
see how you feel thinking about it and do it again

  
so see the trauma, see how it makes your body react, scale it, put it into your hands, send it to universe, take couple of breath. verify how you feel again.  
RINSE and repeat.

  
Did it work for you? if not comment below i'll help you.

651473fb2752280b1a749370	631_ptsd	"PTSD court treatment update #2: The Euphoria is wearing off and reality is setting in. It’s not all bad, but it’s not all good. It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

651473fb2752280b1a749370	2193_ptsd	"Was in a traumatic car accident last week I don't know what I'm trying to gain from posting this, I think I just need to talk about it. Maybe hear similar stories. I've been trying to not talk about it too much to my friends and family because it was traumatic for them, too, and I'm sure they're sick of hearing about it. I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I know it's gonna be long. I apologize in advance. 
I was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically. 
My mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us. He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake. I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react. 
His mini van hits us right on my door. I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state. 
It happened exactly like it does in the movies. In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself. I expected the car to just stop. I keep replaying that moment in my head. Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window. The window shatters on me, the airbag goes off, my door caves in on me. Everything goes red then a pale orange. 
Our car spins what feels like a million times and when we stop everything smells like smoke. I hear screaming and it takes me a while to realize it's me screaming. My mom gets out before I even realize we've stopped moving. I can't get out, my door is caved in. I feel like the car is going to explode and I can't do anything. I'm sure that I'm going to be set on fire. My whole face feels wet and I notice blood dripping onto my jacket. I can't open my right eye. Maybe I was just too scared. I don't know. My mom pulls me out of the car from the drivers side. 
From the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming. One woman, who I later learned had medical training of some sort, got a clean towel from her house and put it over my eye. Her daughter was on the phone with 911. She was trying to help me breathe but I was hysterical. I ask if everyone in the other car is okay. She says they're all okay, I'm the only one bleeding. 
At the hospital, they take two pieces of glass out of my eye, right below my eyebrow. By some miracle, all I have is a concussion, the stitches from the glass above my eye, lots of bruising and some cuts from the glass. I'm gonna be out of work for 1-2 weeks. The general consensus is that I'm very lucky I didn't die. I have lost about 6 of my old classmates to car accidents alone this year. 
On one hand, I do feel lucky. I should've been in worse shape. On the other hand, to be honest, most days I wake up, I wished it killed me. I feel like I'm trapped in my own life now. Being in cars now is suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box underwater. Loud noises, the smell of smoke, seeing headlights, walking too close to the road, the sound of car horns. Fireworks. Doors closing too hard. Everything scares me. The drives to my doctors appointments are excruciating. I think about what it might've been like if I just died. 
I feel completely out of control of everything. I obsess over everything I can't control now. Natural disasters, house fires, accidents of any kind. I don't want anyone to leave my sight because if I can't see them in front of me, then I don't know they're safe. It feels so unfair this guy just got to rip away my peace of mind. I've become so preoccupied with control. What I can control, what I can't control, what others around me can control. 
I have PTSD already, from childhood abuse and a sexual assault that happened two years ago. I also have OCD which is probably responsible for my new obsessive thoughts. 
Maybe it's dramatic. My injuries are minor compared to what could've happened. But I feel completely broken. I want to stay positive but I'm really struggling with the idea of this being my reality forever. This has destroyed me in a way I could never describe to someone who hadn't felt it."

A list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.

Extreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn’t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.


Fainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I’m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children’s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)


Insomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn’t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn’t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven’t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. 


Vivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it’s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. 


Social Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)


Heart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn’t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)


Depression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn’t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I’m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn’t make me sad or upset, it’s not like I wanted those things because I don’t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn’t close to my dad but wasn’t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn’t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn’t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)


Irregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I’m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)


Concentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) 


A few other things I experienced but I don’t feel like going into:
Eating disorders
Alcohol and drug abuse 
Promiscuity 


All of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I’m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. 


Just now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns."

I haven’t been offically diagnosed with PTSD or even know where or who can give me an offical diagnosis, but I’ve read posts on here and can relate to some...

Is it possible to have PTSD from being a CSA survivor and seeing my mom dead? 

I’m a CSA survivor, the abuser being my biological grandfather on my late mom’s side of the family. The abuse (molested) started in preschool and didn’t stop until December 2015 or 2016. 

In addition to being a CSA survivor, I lost my mom May 30th, 2019. She had multiple health issues before my brother and I were born and got worse over the last 10 years. For reference my brother was born in July 1998 and I was born in February 2000. Anyways, I had a dream I watched her die of a heart attack and sure enough 3 days later she died, most likely of a heart attack. My dad and I had gone to the store and when we got back she was face down on the floor, next to her bed. We had only been out for 40-50 minutes. I had my brother call 911 while I took our dogs in my room so the paramedics could do their thing. I knew she was gone soon as I saw her body. After I don’t know how much time passed she was declared dead. I still had to stay with the dogs because of the medical examiners and funeral home people, so after some more time passed we shut the door to my parents room so I could talk with our pastor and cry with my family. Soon as I saw the foot of the body bag I walked to my room with my back turned to it. I didn’t want to see her get rolled out... but just when I thought the funeral people had already taken her outside, I turned around. It was a mistake. I saw her face in the body bag as they rolled her out and no matter how much everything told me to look away, I couldn’t. 

Ever since then I’ve had countless dreams where I see her die, see my friends go missing and/or end up dead, and see my dad die. I also experience flashbacks that replay the scene of the night she died. I also have flashbacks to when I was molested even though it’s been almost 3 years since it stopped. I don’t know what’s wrong with me because when the flashbacks start, they don’t stop."

I am now married, and my husband’s ex-girlfriend is involved with my ex-boyfriend. They also have a daughter together. My issue is that there is always drama. I am pregnant, and I told my ex-boyfriend that I don't want any drama or arguments. I want to get along as much as possible, and he agreed. However, we just had an incident where my ex-boyfriend started discussing drop-off details about my stepdaughter. I told him that he needed to ask my husband because I can't make decisions about my stepdaughter regarding the matter. That led to an argument. I told him all my concern is when I pick up my daughter. My stepdaughter’s pick-up details are between my husband and his ex-girlfriend. I especially told him I didn't want to be involved. Somehow, he turned it around and then wanted to change the schedule we agreed on. He threatened me and got ugly because I wouldn’t discuss my stepdaughter’s matters with him.
   The point is there is so much drama. I try my best to get along with everyone. I don't understand where I went wrong (besides replying back to his question). I feel like I'm going crazy because this is a constant battle where everyone’s frustrations are taken out on each other, and it's the children that are hurting. I had a party planned for my daughter’s birthday, and my ex-boyfriend told me to cancel those plans because he wouldn’t let me have her. In my eyes, it’s the child that is hurting.

666311aa08a2c2c6c775cf6e	2436_ptsd	"I had a panic attack and felt like it led me into a flashback and I don't know if I responded properly. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety since the last three years, and I couldn't get any medical help as my parents said they ""don't believe in mental diseases"" and only recently, as I managed to get some professional help, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and insomnia, and this was about two months back.

I have always felt that my symptoms more or less would be better diagnosed as PTSD. I have been in taking medication for the last few months.

I have been having panic attacks since the last three years, with varied intensity, although avoiding triggers have been helpful. When they are very intense, I kinda seem to go into this flashback where I feel as if I am in a past event of my life and things are repeating themselves. As could be understood, my body tries to prevent this by going into a state of panic before and all this combined with the anxiety of panic attacks and my past and all those memories make my life so much harder and deteriorate the quality of living to very substantial levels. 

A couple of days back, something triggered me and I was about to have a panic attack. As I was on medication, I was able to let it happen, and soon, I was in this flashback which related to the times where I was little and my parents used to abuse me physically. They used to beat me, for invalid reasons, for trying to take their angry out, or express their emotions. And suddenly, I understood what was going wrong. I was afraid. I was afraid, that they would kill me, and I won't be able to stop them or do anything, and this was the same feeling as 10-12 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

But this time, I did something different. When I was in the flashback, I.... I stopped my dad. I grabbed the stick he was using to beat, and I tried to stop him. But he wouldn't. He tried to hurt me again, but then, in order to defend myself, I had to hurt him. But even then he wouldn't stop. So I kept hurting him, and I started feeling better and secure. It was as if the fear was going away and no one could harm me. But then my mum comes in the picture and she starts hurting me, and I did the same.

&amp;#x200B;

As I found myself being safe, I was able to control myself, and breathe properly, and the thing ended. I still had my mind numb for a while, as usually happens with my panic attacks, but I felt better.

Am I okay? Can you please give me your opinion on this? Thanks for reading."

A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn’t stand with out pain.
For the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I’d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I’d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn’t go in I’d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn’t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.
Because I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time

Iv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can’t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don’t really talk in therapy session and the reply’s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school

There’s an emotion I feel when I’m in a state sometimes, it’s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it’s like there’s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there’s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I’m experiencing and I’m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can’t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.

^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^

No one ever told me what ptsd really entails, if you cold give me a little insight, it would be appreciated.  x

I’ve finally gotten help for my PTSD and while I feel positive it will actually help me, I’m struggling to function. I work 8-5 and I’m exhausted from dealing with insomnia most nights. When I don’t have insomnia and actually sleep, I’m left with a loss of interest in all aspects of my job. I go to work, struggle to do any actual work, go home, eat, and lay on the couch or in bed because I’m too exhausted to do anything else. My husband does all of the house work and it makes me feel so guilty. I have no interest in doing anything else and don’t care much about anything. 

My boss knows of my ptsd and insomnia and is so supportive, which I’m extremely grateful for. But I feel this life isn’t for me. I hate working 8-5 especially when I’m dealing with mental health issues and little sleep. I fantasize about quitting my job all the time. My husband works from home, which I wish I could do but can’t in my current position, so we could try to survive on one salary but it may be hard. We just moved into a new apartment and the rent is a little high for one salary, so I feel obligated to work full time. Does anyone else feel like this? Are you able to work full time and deal with your ptsd? I get the feeling that I may be better off finding a part time job while I go to therapy for my trauma and give myself space to actually deal with it.

So my mother  was a decent mother when her and my father together, but after they divorced she started partying with a lot of trashy men. She would neglect my brother and sister (I lived with grandparents) and not buy them groceries except for chips and she would sit in her home all day with her boyfriend and shoot heroin.

5f26f8c4865df449da96eb01	1359_ptsd	"From ok to 0 in about 2 seconds I have a bunch of traumatic things that have happened to me while I was growing up (sexual abuse from family members, a long-term emotionally abusive relationship that has thankfully ended, and continually high pressure from my family to perform and has been very verbally abusive).

Previously I’ve been able to cope extremely well and sort of swept all of this under the rug. I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life’s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.

2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I’m seeing therapists but they haven’t put down a diagnosis yet) as I’m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I’ve had to stop work for the moment because I can’t cope.

I am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner’s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.

It’s father’s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven’t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it’s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don’t resolve any issues. And it’s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn’t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it’s taken a full toll on me.

The relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn’t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father’s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad’s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn’t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I’m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I’m terrified about my future and whether I’ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I’m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn’t that good to start with. My parents don’t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).

Right now I don’t feel safe and I don’t know what to do. This post didn’t really have a question - I am just massively triggered right now and want to vent my story anonymously. Thanks for reading."

I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent/ramble/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)

I had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. 

I've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. 

Nope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. 

And then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then ""wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?"" 

And then the floodgates started to open. 

*  ""Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable""      
* ""Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.""      
* ""I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me. All two of the physical fights I have been in, have been with him when he was in the house and I snapped after he wouldn't leave despite me begging mom to have him leave""      
* ""What are the other symptoms of ptsd? (googles) ... disturbed sleep? ..."" (i am a violent sleeper. i dont put sheets on anymore as they 100% always are ripped off as i thrash in my sleep""     
* ""and... shouting in your sleep? ......"" (no conscious memory, but apparently every night i shout out things. my mom doesnt mention it much anymore unless it was a bad night, but whenever i share a hotel with someone I wake up to ""why were you shouting ""stop go away stop"" at 3 AM?"")           
* ""what else cou- nightmares too?"" (never related to trauma in a way i can discern, but have nightmares that wake me up screaming in about 1/3 sleeps)             
* ""exaggerated startle response? Does that mean what I think? ... Yes. ... fuck..."" (its not quite as severe anymore but i used to invariably freak out if someone touched me without me seeing it. My dad(never hit me, never abused me, was the chill parent) used to poke me in the car at random, just jokingly. I would flinch and recoil every time. Eventually I got to a point where I would sit pushed against the passenger side door to try and get away from it. He asked me at the time why I flinched and got scared, he never hit me. I didnt know why I did that but I couldnt stop. Now I dont do well with people touching me at random, surprising noises, loud bangs, sirens and fire alarms)   

It was like I was looking at a connect the dots, and the dots were all in a straight line in numerical order. I got deeply confused. Why hadn't I ever talked to my psychiatrists about this? Why didn't I realize I have flashbacks weekly or more? Why didn't I realize hearing aggressive shouting is very prone to do this, even from strangers in public, or in film/tv? Why didn't I realize my reaction to the memory or presence of my moms abuser far exceeds what is normal? Why did I not connect my hatred of his face, Heineken, the smell of spilled beer, or his cologne with this? How did I never admit this? Any of this? Why did I always deny I had trauma issues or dodge the question so deftly, all the while completely unconscious of what I was dodging? What the fuck do I do now? 

I feel like I wasn't hurt badly enough. I wasn't the direct target of any of his violence until I was an adult. It wasn't sexual or combat related. It didn't ruin my life(depression did that for me) like my friend, who I knew disassociates for hours and wakes up multiple times nightly from the nightmares. I feel guilty for even considering it, but I detect too many characteristics that line up for me to ignore it. I'm making an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I've been seeing psychiatrists for 9 years by now and I've never done this. 

My sense of self and my understanding of my mental health has been destroyed. I feel like I was assembling a jigsaw puzzle of myself, was mostly done, and perhaps 40% of the puzzle just got torn off, mixed up, and the pieces thrown across the floor. I've always felt that if nothing else, I knew what happens to my brain. I thought it has been the same for years now. That there wasn't more to discover, just need to work more therapy and cope better. But there's been a giant red neon sign saying ""THESE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS YOU DOLT"" here the whole time and I've been blind to it. What else could I have missed? How deep does this trauma stuff run? How am I supposed to self evaluate when I can apparently never be objective about these things? What use is talking about ones symptoms if I managed to perfectly lie to myself and to my doctors and therapists for all of these years?

It's so plainly obvious, I think I must have subconsciously been refusing to accept it. To protect.. something. That's why I think I was able to take off the blinders about this when I was uninhibited through the drugs I took to calm down. Its my only thought I've managed to come up with regarding why I never saw the plainly obvious truth, and instead unconsciously denied and avoided, with expert skill, connecting the symptoms to trauma. Even the flashbacks. I always just thought I was being dramatic and emotional. I never had a thought about them beyond ""oh just ignore it"". Even though I knew what PTSD commonly presents as. Even though I didn't think I was hiding anything or that I would hide anything like this. 

I'm talking to my psychiatrist soon. I don't look forward to it at all. I have a feeling it will be awful trying to say any of this. I don't even know what's next. I am not able to reduce my exposure to my triggers. I can't control him. My mom thinks I should like him and has never understood how upset I get. Even when I (of all people, never hurt a fly, never wanted to fight anyone, ever) have been so upset by his presence, combined with hearing his inescapable voice in my bedroom, that I attacked him. Two different times. I can't even type this post without crying from this. Talking. Ugh. :(

Sorry for this huge wall of text. I'm just. My brain feels like scrambled eggs. So many questions. Feel so lost about who/what I am as a person and what my mental illness means and how they affect me. It's seemingly all gone out the window and I'm put back at the start. Need to start working on writing stuff down for my appointment so I can't conveniently forget to mention it.

5f26f8c4865df449da96eb01	1265_ptsd	"Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. 

Going to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. 

I was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.

I dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. 

I dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.

Honestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.

I feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. 

It's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. 

But still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. 

I'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.

I know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. 

**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks.

5f26f8c4865df449da96eb01	227_ptsd	"I reflexively calmed down after my anger flared up for the first time today. TW: violence

For almost 3 years now I've been struggling with a PTSD that I got from being assaulted in public twice in a row in the span of 2 months. Since this was pretty public and the public was very apathetic to it it caused me to feel very worthless. I felt a lot of resentment for other people. Since then I've had anger issues. I got pretty good at hiding this though. 

&amp;#x200B;

In these last 3 years violence has played a big part in my routine mental thought. If I was mad at someone, even for the slightest smallest ""infractions"" towards me, I would fantasize about hurting them in some way. Life was mostly good, but I'd spent hours pacing around my apartment thinking about how people had ""crossed"" me that day, and how they were going to pay for it. It is really scary stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until today I always had to put in concious effort to stop when I caught myself having these involuntary fantasies. But today, for the first time, I caught myself in a fantasy and reflexively got myself out of it. It almost feels like my body finally realizes that I don't actually live a violent life, and that I can tackle my problems in other, healthier ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned to function with my PTSD for a long time now (therapy yay!), but this feels like the biggest step towards recovery yet. I really hope this trend continues, because sometimes I'm still afraid that one day I might slip up, and do something that I would regret. Luckily that hasn't happened yet, and things seem to get easier with time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you folks ever felt like they where ""stuck"" in a violent state of mind? How do you guys cope with it?  Are you guys hopeful for a full recovery or do you believe that PTSD is something you have to learn to live with? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Anger issues due to PTSD for long time, it feels like they're getting less."	[]	[{'start': 154, 'end': 336, 'span': 'I got from being assaulted in public twice in a row in the span of 2 months.

5f26f8c4865df449da96eb01	1334_ptsd	"[NFSW] [Vent] [Trigger Warning] Feel like I won't recover It's difficult to believe if you look at me normally, or the way I talk about my family. I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.

I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.

I just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? 

A few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.

I feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. 

I think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future. I just want to be ok. :( "	[]	"[{'start': 254, 'end': 692, 'span': ""when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot.

5f26f8c4865df449da96eb01	544_ptsd	Anyone just feel like being alone but at the same time wanting someone to talk to. I’ll give a little backstory. I was always kicked out of my house living at different cousins, aunts, and finally my grandmas house. One of my best friends died in my arms as I performed CPR on him waiting for the medics to arrive. I became a paramedic after that saying to myself I’m going to be better so nobody has to go through that. Turns out it’s really hard to save lives. I’m not going to go into calls I’ve ran or things I’ve seen. But friends and family always ask what’s the worst I’ve seen/done. Not realizing that to them it’s just a story but to us we relive it. It makes me just want to be alone. But at the same time I want to have friends. It’s weird. Is that a form of PTSD. I’m sorry I’m super new and don’t know how this works.

So I've been hit with a ruler once I think and I was hit until it broke. I only recall this once but is this okay? I've heard many of my friends say that they've been hit too (as it's sort of asain culture). I remeber I was in trouble because I lied to my mother due to being afraid of being caught and hit again.

Is this okay?

I feel like I did something to deserve it in a way
Anyways when she was yelling at me I only heard a ringing noise and my vision started to turn black. I wasn't really able to see her but I heard her clearly. I remember that I didn't say anything cause I was too scared admit it to her and getting into more trouble.
Right now I haven't been spanked (or hit) but I just remember it vividly and I don't have the guys to tell my mother about it. I remember my mother saying how ""liars go to hell"", ""why'd you lie about your grades? I would have found out anyways"", ""why do I take you to tutor when you'll just get B's?"", ""look at me"" and ""why are you crying?""

Anyways I feel guilty... I recently heard she had rheumatism (I think) right after I was born. I'm the only child right now and I just feel like I have to get good grades so I can do something... I guess

Anyways is this okay? Are all families like this? I'm sure it's normal

( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right¿ but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone ""stops breathing"" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn .."

I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things. You can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision, but ultimately he has to decide what to do. Know that you won't be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening, validating his feelings, and understanding. Regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook up....I'm not sure if that is possible. If you care for him on more than a friendship level, then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what. Be careful that you take care of yourself and don't jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues. Good luck to you!

So I have been dating this guy for a few months, and things have moved quite quickly for us. I took the step to be up front about my PTSD and trauma and triggers, and he was extremely positive and helpful! He has always been supportive. 
However, about a week ago, I was at his house, and my mind was absolutely locked onto thoughts involving a recent trauma, I was raped in the spring, and he knew this. I was pacing and out of focus and trying to work through it, and I told him that's what was on my mind.

He continually asked if I was okay, but would interrupt me if I spoke with asking, that was the first sign he really wasn't paying attention (I didn't want extra attention but in case something happened he would at least know which trauma it related to). He then proposed to help me, I said I didn't think there was anything he could do at this moment, and he replied with ""We could have sex, that takes your mind off things!"" 

I was shocked, but also so deep in my mind I didn't react right away. He assumed I did not hear him, so he suggested it again, and I told him now isn't the time. He then started playfully grabbing me and saying he was going to make me feel good, asking for sex, and I was IMMEDIATELY covered in this layer of disgust and discomfort, I felt like gagging. I quickly pulled away and yelled NO, and he then made a 'pouty' face and then turned away from me. 

I was shaking for about five minutes, unable to move, and felt so dirty and ashamed. 
I got up to leave (I was going to leave around this time anyway), and was very quiet when leaving. He gave me a hug, and squeezed me super tight, which made me yell STOP, and rush out the door. 

I have barely spoken to him, and I did get the courage to tell him (through text unfortunately) exactly what happened. He apologized profusely, admitted he should have paid more attention, etc.

But now my issue is, I feel gross even if he messages me. I haven't been able to respond to him. He keeps telling me about his days and then ending with ""oh sorry, I always make it about me,"" and I know him well enough to know he is not intending that statement in a passive aggressive manner, that's just his way of saying he feels he made another mistake through a text.

I feel so guilty because every strong feeling I had for him immediately vanished, I don't want to hurt him, and (selfishly) I don't want to be so alone again. But now he reminds me of the assault in the spring, I dont know how to move forward or mend this situation.

so point of the post, i am trying to work through my trauma, because although it was hard for me to sleep as a child, now every time i start to go to sleep i have anxiety attack’s, which end up me pulling a 72 hour all nighter, sleeping for 16 hours then repeating that cycle. it seems like my trauma is affecting me in what i didn’t know it could, and i don’t know how to get through it. i don’t have insurance or money to get professional help. any tips? when i was younger i used to write and draw a lot, but my mom read my journals to my siblings, and now it’s really hard for me to write. i’m used to unhealthy coping mechanisms, and they seem to help more than the healthy ones, but i don’t want to continue to practice unhealthy coping mechanisms, and i really want help. another issue i seem to have is i don’t know who i am as a person, i don’t know if this has anything to do with me being dissociative, but it’s kinda scary, looking at myself and not recognizing anything. sometimes hold my own hand or stroke my arm to remind myself that i’m a person, i check my pulse to make sure i’m still alive because sometimes i don’t feel like i am. i feel numb. to everything and i really want to get better."

I ran up and tackled him, as we have done many other days before. We would always wrestle, have snowball fights, goof off. Today was different. 

When he got up he grab my arms and I grabbed his back ready to wrestle. Thats when I felt something hit my in the ear hard and my leg buckled. I was then throw to the sidewalk and he laid on top of me and kept hitting me with his right fist into my left cheek. I remember trying to get up and saying ""Let me get up"" but kept getting punched in the side of my face. Then the back of my head was slammed into the concrete. I was then let up. I didn't know what to do. It was me, him and one ""friend"" just watching. He looked again, smiled, and came towards me. Again, I was thrown to the ground, hit in the side of the face multiple times, and had the back of my head slammed into the concrete. 

I walked home to find a knife, any weapon, but couldn't find anything but a brick in my front yard. I walked back to scare him to try and get him to back down. I didn't ever want to hurt anyone. I dropped the brick and again I was thrown to the ground, punched repeatedly and had my head slammed. It must have been 3,4,5 times. 

I walked home with that ""friend"" and immediately cried and broke down. This day has replayed in my head freqently ever since it happened. I turned to drugs at 14. Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything. Plotted suicide. 

Its been 15 years and it has been replaying in my head ever since. I have difficultly making friends. I stay home most weekends. I feel i will never amount to anything. On the outside I look successful. I work at a great company, I go to night class to further my career, I was a successful amateur boxer, I have a great family and girlfriend. But I cannot shake this event. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living. 

I started going to therapy consistently in 2016. I have done talk therapy, cbt, EMDR, energy healing,... I am lost. I hope I can get through this but there are times I feel I will never be confident. I still binge drink and still go through depressive spells. I wonder how my life would be if this didn't happen. It has been 15 years.

6661b44bbe0f8b6c0814925f	750_ptsd	"I don't know if I actually have ptsd TW: Sexual Trauma, suicide

I had what i think are repressed memories that came back about two years ago. I feel like i cant talk about my trauma, because i don't even know if it actually happened, or if my mind just made it up.

I've had a ridiculously high sex drive since late middle school for seemingly no reason, i was obsessed and so lost in fantasies (nothing immoral) that my grades fell. Im trans and poly, like so aggressively poly i have trouble with monogamous relationships. I have diagnosed chemical depression and general anxiety disorders but i thought it was common, especially in high school. I went to therapy but they would always try to figure out ""the real reason"" i was depressed, as though my litte sister passing wasn't enough. I attempted suicide several times, but nobody knew.

I had a sexual relationship with an ex my sophomore year. A few months after we started having sex, i started dissociating and having flashbacks of things i didn't remember, followed by panic attacks. I had had lots of negative sexual encounters (like regret or harassment; i often got my ass slapped in middle school hallways and thought it was a good thing until i was older) which, sadly, lots of afab people do, but i didn't remember any assault. 

I still have the flashbacks, though not as often or aggressively. Some positions or certain phrases trigger it, sometimes it's just the act, sometimes it's because someone angrily kicked their backpack in the hall or raised their voice. I usually have to stop whatever sexual thing I'm doing and often don't do anything else sex-wise for several days, but i can occasionally force it out of my head and continue. I still have an elevated sex drive but not as crazy as before i started getting them. I still have problems with monogamy.

I wonder if the sex drive and my being trans and poly were defense mechanisms, like subconsciously trying to retake control of my body. I guess I'll never really know. I've tried to tell therapists and counselors, but i can't ever spit it out because i feel like they'll tell me repressed memories are a myth or I'm doing it for attention and i just don't know what to do. My ex broke up with me partly because of it. I hate sex now but i love it and i can't just quit. I'm so tired and conflicted and i don't know what to do.

Sorry this is a long one, but I promise there is a point. 

So, I grew up with a sister who psychologically abused me...and physically. She would hit me for breathing too loud, monitoring everything I did, she joined my bullies at school, she told me everyday I was shit, pathetic and nothing. She ground me down, and every time I see her, I feel total rage and want to scream. I have only been actively triggered by her a few times, and the rest of the time I just get this blind anger and rage when I see something I know she likes (animated Disney movies, Halloween, certain candy brands, etc).

I got sexually assaulted and would relive it in my dreams. I could never see his face, and I still can’t remember it, but I remember his hands. Regularly relived this for about 3 years after it happened, then it stopped. This wasn’t a rape. It was all hands. I always thought it was mild but the effect it has on me for years after Wasn’t mild. 

I came out as trans (unrelated to anything else, but being a closeted trans kid wasn’t fun in itself) and I lost friends. A lot of bad stuff went down, fed into stuff from my sister...I don’t want to go into detail, but the world became terrifying and far more dangerous over night, and I lost so many people I loved and I blamed myself for it. I still relive this stuff today.

 I tried to kill myself, mostly due to my life falling apart, anxiety and not being able to deal with whatever this is, whether it is ptsd or something else. I messed it up, thought about what my parents would think, and went for help at my local ER. They took me and locked me on a ward and wouldn’t let me leave. I still can’t go into hospitals and I have attacks whIch feel just like I did when they took me in. I can get set off now by seeing people being imprisoned on tv.

I guess what I’m asking is, are these things and my responses to them typical of ptsd? I know I should be asking a doctor but honestly, I can’t do it. I would rather die than go back to a hospital. I know that is silly but I just can’t.

I was in therapy for a year after I got out of hospital (thankfully, in an office that looked nothing like a hospital) and they never gave me a diagnosis more than “severe anxiety &amp; depression.” I suspected I had some kind of ptsd but assumed that it would have come up. Also...I’m not a war vet and my symptoms have been fairly mild compared to some of the stories on here. But then...a couple of friends of mine with ptsd told me I should think about it.

Basically, are my experiences typical of ptsd and should I push through and put myself back in the healthcare system to work this out?

6661b44bbe0f8b6c0814925f	2641_ptsd	"What are your flashbacks like? (possibly triggering for sexual abuse, rape, trauma) Hi everyone,

I'm pretty new to this sub and would like some insight into what others feel when they are experiencing flashbacks.

BACKGROUND INFO (skip if you want)

To give some background information on my experience, I was sexually abused/raped(?) by my step dad 4 years ago (and sexually abused by him multiple times over many years before) but I didn't get any medical help for that although I did tell my mum and boyfriend about it after the ""big happening"". I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. 

**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. 

For me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. 

Why do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   

TL;DR

my flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?

Background on me: PTSD diagnosed , childhood trauma, I don’t remember a lot of my childhood and continue (as an adult) to go into black out mode when things get tough. I am a virgin who plans to stay one till marriage because of sexual trauma. 

I dated a guy for three months who lied a lot. It was the peak of my drinking problem (70 something days sober). I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend. He would drink nothing. I would go in my room thinking I passed out but we would still do sexual things that was not sex. Remember I am a virgin. 

One night I got so drunk I don’t remember making it to bed. He knew how much I drank. He never said anything. If anything encouraged by buying alcohol for me and my roommate. I woke up the next day with awful vaginal pain. When I peed it felt like my insides were ripped and I had blood in my urine. That lasted for three days before slowly fading away. When I asked my ex about it he said he used three fingers and that’s why. I didn’t think anything of it. 

I got drunk a few more times but not blackout and we do things again. I try to set boundaries with him about it realizing I needed to and he texted me “I didn’t rape you” I didn’t think anything of it because rape is such a triggering thing. I shut it down super quick. 

I don’t know if this is rape or not because when I would get drunk I would ask to have sex but he would say no. He knew I wanted to wait and he wanted to be a good boyfriend. But the three finger excuse didn’t make sense because we consensually used that many before and it didn’t feel that way. I didn’t feel torn and I didn’t bleed. Do you think he waited till I was so unconscious to do something? I didn’t bring up rape in the text but he jumped right in like he was ready to defend himself. I understand it’s a rough accusation but I don’t understand why he jumped to it.

I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.

I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.

I just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? 

A few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.

I feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. 

I think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future.

The second one is the one that impacted me the most, I was pretty calm after it happened, but afterwards I started to search it up on my phone, and I came across the fault of San Andreas.  After reading more and more about it, I just started to get really paranoid. I thought that another earthquake was gonna happen and I was gonna die. I remember staying up all night, and I was convinced that I was gonna die. The whole night I was thinking of ways I was gonna die and was was gonna happen when I was dead. I’m making this post after the day a follow up earthquake was likely to happen but didn’t. But yesterday I was just so scared thinking about the earthquake that happened a day ago that when I wanted to do something, I was thinking in my head what’s the point?, I’m gonna die today anyways. I can’t relax in my bed anymore, if I don’t move for more than a few seconds I start to get paranoid and think that the bed is shaking from an earthquake, and I also think back to the day I thought I was gonna die. Honestly I don’t know what to do or if this is considered ptsd at all.	[]	[{'start': 72, 'end': 126, 'span': 'Three days ago there were 2 earthquakes in California.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I emailed a few therapists from the Blue across Blue Shield website hoping to find someone in- rework to reduce costs, and I got no response.  I message 5 therapists on psychologytoday.com and got no response. I keep browsing for more therapists but so many only have time slots from 9-5 Monday through Thursday.

I’m just really frustrated. I’m going to keep looking, but this is starting to get even more frustrating.  Does anybody have any suggestions?

6053fa19a8ec1c1580fabe2b	2496_ptsd	"I've been diagnosed with PTSD but it doesn't feel right (Mention of violence) This is going to be a long post. Sorry!

I've always had anxiety but a little over a year ago I got the courage to solo-travel New Zealand long term. I gained a ton of confidence while doing this, and overcame a lot of my social anxiety. Eventually I got a job in Christchurch, it wasn't all perfect, I had my ups and downs but I was doing pretty well - going for walks frequently, exploring the city, living a 'normal life'.

Then the shooting happened. To be clear, I didn't see/hear/experience anything. My life was never in actual danger, I was just living in the city at the time. At first it was disbelief, then fear (not knowing if they caught everyone) then crippling sadness. I had such a strong desire to run away and just go home but I couldn't right away. One of my coworkers was shot and spent months in ICU. I left Christchurch a little over a week after the attack. It felt wrong, but I had been offered a job back home and had already put my notice in at work.  

At first when I got back home and started my new job I was mostly fine. I was living with my parents until I could get an apartment in the city closer to work. I moved into my apartment in May and started having issues pretty quickly. Waking up multiple times a night, disoriented and sweaty. Random attacks of sadness and excessive anger over small problems. Being afraid of random people on the street. Wanting/needing to go do something (go to the store for example) and having a mental block. Anxiety over inconsequential things.

I started going to therapy in June and he diagnosed me with PTSD. He gave me an ESA letter to get a dog which has helped immensely. But the therapy wasn't helping, my brain would kind of just shut off and I wouldn't have anything to say and I wouldn't remember anything he would say. It was really just giving me more anxiety so I stopped going.

The diagnosis just doesn't feel right to me. Maybe because I know I was never in any actual danger. I get intrusive memories of the sadness and aftermath though.  Recently I've been even more hyper-vigilant than usual. I listen to audiobooks at work so my mind doesn't wander but it makes me anxious because I don't always know when someone approaches me, and I jump when they do. I get anxious walking outside when its too quiet, dark, rainy (hood up, peripheral vision blocked) or too crowded, and I cant walk with headphones in. I feel like I am constantly stressed and anxious even though I have no real reason to be. I scratch at arms and hands and have a hard time making myself stop.

I've always had problems with anxiety and mood swings so I'm having a hard time distinguishing from old symptoms and new. Part of myself keeps thinking that this isn't PTSD, this is just my anxiety coming back.

6053fa19a8ec1c1580fabe2b	1400_ptsd	"Can PTSD lead to psychosis? Here I am again. I've been posting on reddit before about my severe anxiety and fear of psychosis.

But still, as a background note:
I am a 23 year old woman, currently unemployed, with no history of psychosis/schizophrenia in my family, but with history of trauma (bullying, abusive father, parental divorce, neurological illness of my twin brother). I'm currently living with my mother and twin brother.

So, because of the whole covid quarantine, I engaged in online therapy. I contacted a clinician psychologist  via a mental health website following a video evaluation and a series of tests for diagnosis. 
After all of them, I scored very high in most anxiety disorders which are: PTSD (highest), health anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and OCD.
I also did a psychosis test which came out with 0 points result, meaning that I have no hallucination or delusion.
She adviced me to continue talk therapy and (optional) medication but accentuated the talk therapy. 
 I'm currently still trying to save some money for the upcoming sessions so right now I can't attend them.

The thing is this: for the past month I've been dealing with derealization and been stuck inside my head all day.
I have a huge fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia after accidentally coming across on google while searching for symptoms of dissociation.

As mentioned, I don't have hallucinations or delusions, but I experience some things maybe related to my PTSD. For example:
- when my brother doesn't answer my phonecalls I get a panic attack and racing thoughts about something terribly happening to him (he is diagnosed with epilepsy).
- I tend to avoid songs, places, movies, topics that remind myself of my trauma experiences, otherwise I think they might reoccur.
- I have a tic that's lip picking, when i'm stressed or bored.
- I have agoraphobia due to a traumatic event when I passed out 5 years ago (due to hypoglycemia) and always go out feeling tense and stuck in my head.
- when I get derealization, I struggle to focus on my surroundings and my speech.
- when I send a text to a friend or say something that might upset them, I think about that a lot of get scared of them wanting to distance from me (it happens only ocasionally, but it's still concerning me).
- being stuck in my head, I became a bit less responsive to conversations with my family.

My traumas were triggered when I was 9,13,14 and 18.
Ever since the evaluation, I began to think a little more clear about my mental state but I still have the psychosis themed fear and the idea of losing my mind or losing control of myself terrifies me.
In the past year my self esteem has been very affected, I don't feel in control of myself and feel like I lost my independent life; I feel the need to rely on my mother and brother. Before that, I used to trust myself and my mother and brother relied on me too. They still do, but I feel like I'm the one who can't rely on myself.
All of this happened after getting the psychosis fear.

I read somewhere that PTSD can come with secondary psychosis in a much higher rate than in general population and it scared me badly considering my phobia.
I feel like I need more information on this, as my fear convinces me that because I have PTSD, I might get psychosis too.
Are there any important details about this? Does psychosis in PTSD manifest the same way as in regular psychosis? Why do some PTSD sufferers develop it and other PTSD sufferers don't?
Does my personal case suggest I might develop psychosis?"

In many ways, we react to our environments - and if you're still surrounded by neighbors who didn't reach out when they heard your ex yelling or offer assistance and resources when your son acted differently than his peers, it might make sense that you're more timid around folks. It might also be worth thinking about where your bar is set: do you want to be as comfortable around people as you were before your recent circumstances? Or find your new normal, and connect only with people who raise you up and bolster your self-esteem? You have the right to be both cautious (if you're still surrounded by the same folks and environment) and discerning - only connecting with people who will be supportive.

I'm pretty new to the idea of me having PTSD, since I always thought of PTSD in the context of war/physical harm. However, in the past two years, I think I've pinpointed that my emotional issues stem from a specific incidence of trauma from when I was a kid, but I'm doubting if this memory was actually 'traumatic enough'. 

When I was around 7 years old, I had a pet parakeet. My older brother, around 14 at the time, offered me a quarter if he could have my her. In my mind, since we lived in the same house, he could have the bird but she would still be here in the house, so it didnt matter. I don't remember much of the events that happened after that moment, but I remember that he had had a friend over and they were joking around. Anyways, we had the kind of glass windows that shut closed. At some point, my brother put the bird in the windowsill and smashed the glass slider against her, basically killing her violently. 

I believe I suppressed this memory, or blocked out most of it, since I don't remember much of what happened afterwards. 

I'm making this post because I have told only one person in my life about this situation, and while she is incredibly supportive and helpful with my emotional issues, I still feel in the back of my mind that this /isn't/ PTSD, and my issues don't stem from this experience at all. 

For the entirety of my life, I have felt an extreme, often paranoid fear of people close to me hurting me physically or even killing me. I am currently seeing a wonderful guy, but I feel like I have PTSD glasses on and am searching obsessively for signs that he's a sociopath. This obsessive fear, of someone close to me turning out to be a sociopath/someone who will violently hurt me, has been a ever present theme in my life, and I am wondering if this worry is directly caused by the experience with the bird, or if it's coming from something else.

So, when i was around the age of 13 I went to a mental hospital to help me with my suicidal thoughts and depression. The place was horrible and caused me a lot of trauma. The staff were abusive and gave me so much medication that on my 8th day of being there i only thought it was my 3rd day due to how out of it i was.
So, for the most part i barely remember everything that happened there but sometimes i get random flashbacks to moments I either blocked out or didn't remember due to the medication.

One I recently remembered happened around my last day there. The only reason I left was due to the fact that i had a melt down during visitations and my family forced me out of the hospital, by now I'm questioning if this was one of the things that caused my tipping point.

I have bad psoriasis, it was especially bad back then. Covered 75-80% of my body, so i constantly had to use medicine. The staff would give me it after taking my pills and I'd go to a private room by myself to apply it.
Well, near the last day a nurse didn't hand it to me but instead took it, brought me to a different room, took my shirt and pants off without warning, then started applying it to my body. She then went on to go underneath my underwear to apply it onto my backside.

I was too confused and dazed to really do anything or tell her I was uncomfortable because the medication instantly hit me with drowsiness/fuzziness but i remember feeling humiliated and shocked by it.

She was a female nurse, kind of sweet but could be very rude at times. She often picked favorites as well. This memory just came out of the blue and i instantly felt so fucking disgusted and shocked because it didn't seem or feel right and I never remembered it until i was just randomly looking back on my experiences there. 

I'm questioning if it's okay for me to feel this way about it. I feel guilty because maybe she was just really use to taking care of little kids and got carried away? Is that behavior normal? No one else in the hospital did that to me from what i remember.  I'm scared to see a doctor and talk to them about my mental health and worries though because i don't wish to deal with that all over again, too much happened in such a short amount of time and yet i barely remember most of it.

I went through protocol to redirect his attention to me so that we could continue to play, but when none of that worked sp I squirted water onto his neck.

Here I am moving cars and trash cans using them as buffers between me and the dog until he brings me down, and goes ham on my leg almost to the point of breaking it.

Long story short it's been five months since this event, and my official diagnostic of PTSD. Isn't getting any better even with the help of my therapist. Nightmares always escalate to where the Pit snapped my neck. 

I just needed to post this. I was too afraid to put it on my normal social media accounts because the back lash from pit bull sympathizers,  and to me it dosen't matter it was a pit bull it could have been any dog breed. It just makes life hard when even the smallest of dogs prevent me from enjoying life, and when I feel conflicted about my love of dogs especially when I live in a highly populated dog area."

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	1456_ptsd	"Avoiding EDMR because I’m worried it will make me kill myself [30F] Trigger Warning I’ve been getting professional help for 16+ years for long term depression, anxiety, and self-harm all independent of any trauma. 10 months ago I got PTSD from watching the person I loved most in this world suffer to death against their will (no right-to-die legislation in my state).

It was recommended that I do EDMR but I read that EDMR has you recall the events and I’m worried that if I purposely recall the events that I’ll kill myself. Everyone tells me how much EDMR helped lessen the severity of their PTSD but it doesn’t work immediately, right? So after that first session when I’ve just recalled everything I’d be extremely at risk, right? But on the other hand if I keep avoiding this treatment then the PTSD will never stop.

I don’t have any friends or family nearby who can babysit me. I’m in the US so I don’t get time off work and I can’t afford hospitalization. I’m worried that if I bring up this concern that I’ll be involuntarily committed. 

Not to mention that part of my PTSD comes with a complete distrust of hospitals, doctors, nurses, all of it. I can only trust hard data from actual test results which has already led to a statistically unwarranted biopsy that I needed to get or else I’d lose my mind but who knew you had to be awake for biopsies?! They messed up the procedure and I had to hear the whole conversation that basically went “oops we need to get another doctor in here to fix this” and I could feel all the blood running down my ribs and it’s like, what the actual fuck doctors truly are idiots. If I didn’t have so much experience cutting I’m sure the incision thing would have f’d me up too. The lump was benign.

The PTSD isn’t too bad if I just avoid everything but mornings are rough from nightmares and trying to reconcile my reality again.

So I guess my question is for people who got EDMR: how did you feel after the first time?"

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	205_ptsd	"Experienced an abusive relationship and trying to understand why it is haunting me so severely I am looking for some advice really, as I feel very much at a dead end, and I'm really hoping that this can provide some answers - or at least lead me on to them. 


(I am adding this as an afterthought, but it occurs to me that some of this couldn't be triggering to some. Also, skit to the asterisk to skip several bleak accounts of some bad times and to the point of this post) 

 To clarify, I am not diagnosed with ptsd and am by no means claiming to have the disorder. I exhibit many of the symptoms I have read about, but obviously that is by no means a diagnosis. I post this here, as reoccurring issues I have really been struggling with fall under the symptoms of ptsd, and ultimately, for lack of a better place to do so. If anyone knows of a more appropriate place I may voice my concerns to, feel free to correct me and I shall be on my way. 

Regardless, let me begin. 

I am fourteen (turning fifteen this month), and last year around this time I began a relationship. Although beginning deceptively normal, it quickly and suddenly spiralled into a cycle of abuse, crudely disguised as love. It began with my communication with her having to be constant, unfaltering; this was preferable to the threat of her becoming upset and ignoring or guilt tripping me - or really using any emotional manipulation tactic that you can think of. 

Without me really being able to grasp what was happening, I had been fully isolated from my friends and family, and really, the whole world. She had dragged me into a delusional folié a deux, in which I constantly faced the threat of rejection, shame, dread, isolation and a whole selection of other rotten, empty feelings. 

In addition to the emotional abuse, she coerced and manipulated me into engaging in sexual acts with her, despite me outlining specifically that I did not want to do so. 

Sex became the only way for me to feel as if I was good enough for her, and bore some of the only moments at which she seemed happy and pleased with me. It was exhausting and bestowed on me deep, deep guilt, but if I were to refuse she would emotionally blackmail me and because deeply upset. 

She escalated these sexual encounters to the point of extremity, forcing me to buy condoms when I was on the verge of tears. After these sexual encounters i would often cry, and grow increasingly dislodged from my own body, as it was my only coping mechanism to escape the abuse.  I did everything I could to avoid the same occurrence again; dropping change so we wouldn't have the £2.90 for the condoms, refusing to leave the house if I knew that was her intent, fabricating lies about whatever I had to. 

I remember once, after telling her I didn't want to, the look on her face in a moment of brief lucidity which interrupted her brigade of plastic emotion, when she mentioned casually that if she got me to agree, then it would essentially be rape. 

The further our relationship progressed, the more distant from reality I became, the further I grew from my family and the further my timid self retreated inwards, in hiding.

My travelling to France during the holidays exhibited some of the worst torment I had faced, despite not being in person. Her behaviour was amplified and she still had me almost completely under her illusion, although she was slowly losing her grip.

She would demand to have the passwords to all of my social media, and dig up conversations from months, years prior to dig up as evidence of cheating and disloyalty, only to ignore me for as long as she deemed appropriate and make me feel as guilty as she knew how to.

Weeks before the end of our relationship, she joined me on a family caravaning holiday, which was, in hindsight, hell on earth. Her unrequited jealousy, especially towards my mother and sister, was uncontrollable and beyond reason, and her iron stare haunted the cosy metal box. I looked into her eyes and saw a deep, burning hatred, and became terrified of her. On a particular evening, when the rain was mercilessly beating down on the drooping tents, I was required to accompany her to the toilets, despite her ignoring me. Upon me attempting to talk to her, she quickly turned the corner and abandoned me at a swift, unforgiving place. I, of course, had no idea where on earth she was (she had a nasty habit of doing this) and in my delirious, desperate, confused state, my brain fabricated these tall, black figures who had taken her, as if to create a reason where it was not provided anything remotely attached to reality. Upon being found by my father, urgently pacing around looking for her, hysterical, she expressed no sympathy or concern, but simply offered an empty, dry sorry. 

There are countless other situations I could site, but I think that these I have documented here serve the purpose of explanation well enough. 

In august of last year is when it hits it peak and when I finally severed my ties with her. A barrage of insults following an exhausting, draining, empty argument was my breaking point, and in my desperation I reached out to my present family and family friends, who pointed out to me the reality of the situation. 

Upon reflection, it is clear to me that her actions were a result of her own past trauma, and I hold nothin against her. I have learned that holding anger in your heart does nothing but create more pain and sorrow. I also realise that I was so susceptible to her manipulation, as my mother struggled and is struggling with mental health issues, which lead to her being admitted into hospital for spells of time from when I was about 10-13. I knew she also had mental health issues, and subconsciously i believe I wanted desperately to make her happy because I never could make my mother happy, and felt as if it were my fault. 

*****I am posting here as, these events and feelings haunt me daily. They haunt my dreams, replay over and over in my head, bore their way into my skull like parasites, prevent me from ever just sitting alone with my thoughts, keep me disconnected from my feelings, sensations, my passions. I feel as if I am carrying around with me an immense guilt and sorrow. No matter how much I think I've made peace with my feelings, forgiven, and tried to move on, I have always been dragged back into this seemingly inescapable vortex of foggy, unclear, jumpy memories and an indescribable, constant feeling of dread and guilt. 

Every time I see her name, hear mention of her, pass her in a corridor or even think of her, I receive an unpleasant jab of adrenaline, and my heart races uncontrollably. Any smells or objects that remind me of her provide the same painful jolt and can send me spiralling into despair. 

I am desperate, alone, but I still have so much life to me and I am scared to lose it. I want to set myself free. 

(sorry for any issues with coherency and te length. this seems to have provided a lot of therapeutic value, and that is most likely it's primary function. to expect someone to read this much of something so bleak is unreasonable)

If somehow, you read this far, thank I thank you greatly for briefly indulging in my troubled thoughts, and I wish you the best.

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	797_ptsd	"Advice after gaslighting 
For 3 years straight, I had a friend who kept me wrapped around his finger. 

I was not allowed to be friends with certain people without the suicide card being pulled, I would be constantly demeaned and harassed for anything I would do. Within minutes, I’d be love-bombed. This person made me believe I had their trust. Everything I did was always wrong, and I’d be at blame for everything, and 5 minutes later I was the best person in the world. I was stalked, he had to have tabs on me wherever. All conversations were passive aggressive. 

I am terrified of this person, legitimately terrified. Everyone that they surrounded their self with hates my guts because of what they told them I’ve done. I didn’t do anything but because of gaslighting, I don’t know if I was the abuser or not. I tried to help but also take up for myself. I never belittled them or hurt them deliberately.

Everything I see is skewed now. I’m terrified I’m an abuser. I’m terrified I’m a horrible person but I know I didn’t do anything wrong. I’m paranoid I’m being watched wherever I go.

I haven’t spoken to them in 5 months, and I’m in a great relationship. Every day I worry when they’re going to come back into my life and destroy it all. I can’t live in peace. My birthday is on the 3rd, and I have a feeling that’s when they’ll come back. Does anyone have any advice or can anyone offer support? Everything is appreciated greatly.

Let me add this: they were borderline, I was their favorite person, and I left and never looked back."

The short answer is that there is too much wrong here for this therapist to try and fix it. Relationships don't heal us and they don't help us grow up. We have to be mature and stable enough to love someone before it's going to work. I'd recommend you focus on yourself alone for a while. You have a lot to sort out. I wish you the best.

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	55_ptsd	"Day 2 quitting weed, a lot of emotions (x-posted to r/leaves) Hi everyone. So it’s day 2 for me. I started smoking two years ago to self-medicate PTSD. I believe it has turned into an addiction, with me forgoing food and rent in lieu of buying weed (I don’t have a lot of money so I can’t afford this). I think it did help, but has turned into something uncontrollable at this point. I know I can manage my traumas without weed and with healthy coping skills. Today I’m feeling the weight of anger towards people who have hurt me, who have taken away my basic rights as a human being to my own thoughts and feelings. I realized just now fully that when high, it distracts me and I don’t think about all that stuff.

I’m still trying to rebuild my identity. I feel very very very small. I also don’t eat a lot because of stress and have at times gotten to under 100 pounds, which makes me feel so small and weak and powerless in this world. Completely vulnerable. I feel like certain people have taken advantage of me, and shoved me deeper and deeper into the ground, abusively controlling and judging me when no one has any right to make another person feel like this; like everything that I think, do, like, don’t do, don’t like is wrong. I lived with someone who corrected everything I did, gaslighted me, etc. There are a handful of people I got away from but never got the chance to really stand up for myself.

So now I’m looking at this life I have, no money, no car, no place of my own, underemployed…and I just think…it’s been years of being a doormat and look where it’s gotten me. I’m a people pleaser and never make a fuss with people, I’ve become mute in a lot of situations. I’ve been admitted to the behavioral health clinic several times against my will even though I was not violent and I’m literally just a tiny girl. I’ve been condescended to in those places, belittled, threatened, etc.

All of this is coming up and I feel frustrated. I don’t necessarily feel angry at these people, because they have their own problems and if they were happy people, they wouldn’t treat others the way they do. But I feel a sense of wanting to be strong, wanting to build my life, and wanting to finally have my confidence back. I have been made to feel like garbage for how I chew, for how I walk, for how I do almost anything and even though I’m not in that abusive situation anymore, I still act and feel like they are right over my shoulder and I don’t have any say in my own life. As if all my thoughts are stupid.

I do not like to feel this, I don’t like to feel angry. It makes me feel ugly and petty. I know how hard life is, even for the people who have hurt me, and I want to feel nothing but graciousness and forgiveness towards them. I guess being clear-headed today is just bringing up a lot of emotions and I’m so grateful I can share my thoughts here. I hope I will one day feel confident and strong and like my thoughts do matter. By taking care of myself, I hope I can get there. I wish wellness and recovery towards everyone here, thank you for reading :cherry_blossom:

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	1293_ptsd	Tearing down the walls So I was diagnosed 6 plus years ago due to a lot of possibly triggering events for others so I’ll leave that out. But now today I finally found someone who is kind and loving and just wants to know when I’m hurting. But I have all these walls and built in protections because I’ve been hurt so often. And I’m slowly managing to open windows for him, but I just feel like it’s not fast enough and they don’t always want to stay open. So here is what I ask if you have survived domestic violence, how do you let your walls down enough to successfully communicate? To make a healthy relationship?

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	631_ptsd	"PTSD court treatment update #2: The Euphoria is wearing off and reality is setting in. It’s not all bad, but it’s not all good. It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	103_ptsd	"I am a college student and I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment. Help Long story, but read if you can. 

I came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. 

About a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. 

Lots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. 

The day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. 

I woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear ""COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said ""one sec"" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. 

During this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. 

The main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.

I explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. 

After the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. 

I showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. 

Since I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. 

It got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. 

Do I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. 

I miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. 

anything will help. "	[{'start': 27, 'end': 84, 'span': 'I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment.

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	816_ptsd	"I have PTSD because of a volitile relationship It's a very long story and it's pretty dark. But here goes. I was with this girl for three years and we had a house together, pets, you name it. Well we started fighting a lot and she had self harm issues. Our fights would start out small and next thing you know, we were screaming in the house, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg. She would lock herself in a room and try to cut herself in the middle of these fights, so I would break into the room to stop her (my mind immediately shifting to I'm not fighting with her anymore, I'm going to try and stop her and show her I love her), but she never let up. She would resort to brutally beating me in the face to get me away from her and say the most horrible things to me. She would tell me I was a loser, I was ugly, fat, and all sorts of things that I refuse to remember. I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts. I lied to my friends and said that I got my black eye from work. I remember one time specifically was at AWA, and all of my friends that were there, surrounded me and wouldn't leave me alone about my black eye, which wasn't the first one. I lied to them again and then I told them I had to pee, and went to the bathroom and cried really hard. Fast forward to the end, a couple of years ago. I had a concussion at work. I fell into a running compactor and hit my head, and my boss saved my life. I completely forgot the previous two months, including my sister getting engaged and everything. They wouldn't let me drive or watch movies or anything until I recovered. It was a nightmare. Well I started getting my memory back and she started a fight with me because my friend was coming to see me and she ""wanted to do her workout."" it escaladed very quickly to the same routine as before only this time I broke a statue that we got together and I threw the flowers I got her on the floor and the cops were called again and said one of us had to leave for the night. She kicked me out and broke up with me and never let me come back. I couldn't drive at the time she made me stay outside until my mom came and got me. I begged her not to do it, because I was in love with her despite everything and she treated me like a criminal and condemned me. She tried to turn all of my friends against me (which failed horribly for the most part) and told everyone that I was the one abusing her. I never touched her like that and I never said anything so horrible to her. I treated her like gold 95% of the time and I cared about her more than anything. I left her a long letter on the porch a week after all of this, explaining how much she meant to me and that I wanted a new start with her and she called the cops to tell me to leave her alone and told everyone that I was a psycho. It keeps coming back to haunt me every so often, how do I cope?

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	520_ptsd	Will I ever be normal again? I’ve been dealing with ptsd for around 4 years now. Honest to god, I didn’t think I’d make it this far when it first happened, but I’m glad I did because I’ve become a whole different person. I see things in a different light and have a whole new outlook on life. But I wanna know if anyone’s ever fully gotten over their ptsd? I’ve tried so many therapists, medications, everything under the sun basically. And my last resort would be the move out of where I live, (where everything happened.) I’m just tired of having triggers and it never stops. It’s an ongoing thing every single day and I just want to feel normal again. If anyone has any advice, that would be great.

6658dcfd6369a1496c03f712	2641_ptsd	"What are your flashbacks like? (possibly triggering for sexual abuse, rape, trauma) Hi everyone,

I'm pretty new to this sub and would like some insight into what others feel when they are experiencing flashbacks.

BACKGROUND INFO (skip if you want)

To give some background information on my experience, I was sexually abused/raped(?) by my step dad 4 years ago (and sexually abused by him multiple times over many years before) but I didn't get any medical help for that although I did tell my mum and boyfriend about it after the ""big happening"". I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. 

**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. 

For me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. 

Why do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   

TL;DR

my flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?

Rape, sexual assault, and PTSD do not know fame, race, or gender. At any given time, over 13 MILLION Americans have PTSD. Meanwhile, over 14,000 military members report sexual assault every year.

It’s estimated that 83% of military sexual assaults go unreported, meaning there could be upwards of 82,500 military sexual assaults happening PER YEAR. Since my own military sexual assault in the Marines, 3 months before 9/11, there have been approximately 1.4 MILLION other victims in the military alone. 

Over the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of joining and chatting with numerous social media groups formed to support PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors.

There are thousands in these groups, yet there are millions more suffering on their own. PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.

To show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.

My story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.

In my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.

In the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain. After years on this journey, I have decided to write a book about my experience.

This book is currently in pre-order sales and will be for the next 24 hours. The journey offers some parallels to The Alchemist and Forrest Gump, though this journey is true.

Your support would go a long way to ensure this story gets told and the conversation around PTSD really gets started. [https://publishizer.com/relentless-1/](https://publishizer.com/relentless-1/) . 

Help me help the masses understand this condition so that the silent suffering of millions can end.

During that time I was foolishly oil painting in enclosed spaces (didn’t help my sanity or brain development).  I went a couple months where I couldn’t even go to a full week of school. 
Sometimes I think I’m over it- I can go days without thinking about it. A couple nights ago the dreams kept happening. I’d wake myself up, fall back asleep and they’d happen again. 
I used to want the dreams- but they are now so unwelcome and in my youth never realized they were toxic.

5ced167bde38480019a16976	472_ptsd	"Is it possible to heal PTSD? A little bit about myself first... at the age of 16 i almost died in a car accident by myself, at 25 i got hit by a family van at 45km/hr on the street. and at the age of 27 i got in another car accident at 70km/hr.   
So yes I've got some serious trauma and all my life i asked myself one question. how can i be happy in my whole being naturally like a baby does? 

  
and I've went through an amazing journey to discover really deep fundamental of life. I've always been a positive and resilient guy and that helped me a lot in my life.

  
but i wanted to create my dreams and one of dreams was to be happy again in my body. i knew that for that to happen i had to find a way to heal these past trauma.

  
My goal was, how can i be able to think and relieve a trauma and be free from the emotional baggage of it because i knew that your life is the reflection of what's inside of you.

  
So here's the step by steps way to do this. warning! trauma can take a while to heal but if you stay consistent with this you will see a really big difference over time and it can be rough to go through this but it is worth it.

  
so the first step is to think about the trauma and then really focus on your whole being (emotions, mental, physical and energical patterns) when you think about the trauma.

  
feel the feelings related to the trauma scale them from 1 to 10, 10 meaning it's the worst feeling ever.now take your two hands in front of you and do this. imagine all these feelings, these beliefs etc... imagine them going into your hands and push them into the universe take a breath wait couple of seconds. 

  
**it doesn't matter if you don't believe it will work. DO IT! for the sake of your happiness!!!**

  
then refocus on the trauma and see how you feel NOW thinking about the same trauma. 

  
scale on 1-10 again (sometimes you can feel the emotions spiking up it is alright just continue this process.)

  
see how you feel thinking about it and do it again

  
so see the trauma, see how it makes your body react, scale it, put it into your hands, send it to universe, take couple of breath. verify how you feel again.  
RINSE and repeat.

  
Did it work for you? if not comment below i'll help you.

59d66ebb8fd07a0001841f5b	2155_ptsd	"*tw: sexual assault* my story, and a few questions **Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault**

okay so this is gonna sound weird so i'll start from the beginning

So, it started two years ago when I met a girl we'll call Jamie. So Jamie and I had a lot in common, and immediately became friends. I was new in town and she was my first friend.

The trouble started a year later, (I was 12 at this point, yup I know I'm young) when she started making some horrible comments. For example I told her I was bullied at my last school and she smirked and said ""Oh, so you're an easy target"" It felt weird, I wasn't sure how to react.

Later, when school started again, she kept making comments like those or about my body. I definitely was an early bloomer and she was as well, but she really bugged me about some things about myself.

Then, she molested me. Several times.

At first it was subtle touches, and she told me she was just physical with friends. I thought it was weird because she wasn't that way with other people.

Then it got worse, like a lot worse. Not rape, but intense making out etc.

So that happened at the end of the school year and I didn't see her over the summer.

It was the worse summer of my life, and when school started I was extremely suicidal. At this point, I told a close friend. They helped me a lot.

Jamie took it way too far a few days ago. I'm shaken over it. I just want to get her out of my life.

Jamie is still abusing me.

But here's my problem. I want to report Jamie, I really do. But I feel like I can't for two main reasons

1. She's popular at my small school, everyone knows her. It's a private school, so everyone knows each other anyways but she seems like such a nice person on the outside.

now that I am out of their lives, i am starting to process what happened. what really happened. like, the reality is hitting me. i am seeing all the little ways these experiences make me dysfunctional on a day to day basis, and all the big ones tools. and i don’t know how to start talking about this. any of it. the childhood sexual abuse, the physical abuse, the emotional abuse, the sexual assault, the narcissism. i don’t know how to begin to explain how these things effect me or make me feel because I don’t understand it. I just have little moments where I realise “i probably did that or do that because of x” and then get mad because x made me do that.

im just extremely overwhelmed. i didn’t even tell him I had a history of sexual trauma in the intake, just physical abuse, so he doesn’t even know that. he’s prodded me some about the abuse but it’s so hard to find words to explain and I also kind of shut down. like my brain just stops moving and I get stupid. it’s extremely frustrating.

59d66ebb8fd07a0001841f5b	114_ptsd	"Meet the criteria for PTSD, but feel like what I experienced shouldn’t cause this much stress. I’m a 22 year old female. My mom has always had significant health issues and will likely die of her diseases, although when is not clear. This is something that causes me a lot of grief and distress but I have gotten good at compartmentalizing. 

A few months ago, we learned she had a heart murmur, most likely due to a heart condition that would require surgery. At the time I worked a stressful job and had been backstabbed by my company. (80 hour work weeks, lying boss.) he wouldn’t give me time off to care for her so I quit. Then we learned it was a mitral valve prolapse, and she definitely needed surgery. 

My mom has a personality disorder and has emotionally abused me at times throughout my life, especially when she’s stressed. So during this time she ostracized and bullied me, and banned me from going to the hospital for her surgery. 

In this time she kicked me out for 2 weeks. I stayed with two shitty people who did shitty things. I also got a horrible stomach virus (we all did) and got to a point where I thought I may need to get IV fluids. I have health anxiety so this was really hard for me. I ended up coming back after those 2 weeks. 

I got updates from my dad while she was hospitalized, there were a couple times it was touch and go and they thought it might be time to say goodbye, but she pulled through. Every night I was scared to sleep for fear that she would be dead when I woke up. Gradually I began eating and sleeping less, until one day, a couple weeks or so after her surgery, I didn’t eat or sleep for 3 days. Two doses of Ativan in the ER made no effect. I had a psychotic episode (I’m assuming?) that I don’t remember in which I physically fought the nurses and cussed out my friend. They gave me haloperidol and knocked me out. 

I was put in psych for 3 days in a terrible psych hospital where I received no therapy. The MD met with me once and said I have PTSD, but he thinks it’s from an experience I had as a teenager. 

Backstory on that: my freshman year of high school, I pissed a girl off and she and her friends cornered me and tried to beat me up. I don’t remember much of it, the adrenaline was in overdrive. The only mark on my body was a bleeding cut above my eye from being thrown onto a table. 

It was about 6 months after that that I began having constant panic attacks. Anxiety and depression deeply colored the next 4 years, as did benzo addiction. 

However, I never felt fear when I recalled the event. I had no flashbacks or nightmares. I didn’t avoid any reminders of the event. Basically, I didn’t fit any PTSD criteria, except the anxiety and hyper vigilance. 

Now, I fit the criteria for it. 

I avoid reminders of that time period from the time my mom kicked me out until I got out of the psych ward. 
I won’t watch tv because that’s all I did (unless I’m with someone) 
My house gives me anxiety because it reminds me of being there alone and afraid. 
I am terrified to sleep alone- I’ve only slept alone in my bed a handful of times since then and it’s always so scary to me that I cry if I have to do it. 
I feel empty and like my life will never get better, I can’t see a future. 
When I’m alone I am very afraid. 
I have a loss of identity. 
I feel disconnected to most people. 
I have panic attacks almost daily. 
I struggle to feel emotion, and when I do, I’m either sobbing or wanting to die or hurt myself, I imagine stabbing myself or slitting my wrists to satisfy the urge. 

All the psychiatrists I’ve called are booked out 6 months. I have a doctor appointment this week. Any thoughts?

I want therapy. I want to heal and become a whole human being. I want to work through my traumas, remember it, reconcile it, and move on.

I want to be the best version of my self so I can raise my son's to be healthy human beings. 

I want to be able to like myself. I want to feel like I deserve things. 

My problems, and their dads, have affected them and I want to help them heal to.  I can't fix the past but I can give them a emotionally healthy and stable ready of their childhood. 

So I need therapy.  Probably specific therapy. I don't know how to really go about it. I've tried it before but it's been nothing profound and I have a hard time taking these people's time as if my experiences are as horrific as others who need help more. I tell whiney, complainey, undeserving of telling my story and it holds me back. 

I need to be able to unpack my trauma. I need to.  Then I need to work through the emotions. The abandonment, fear, shame, unworthiness. Then I need to put it to bed healthily. Then I need to work with someone to difficult or how I feel about my abusers and what I should do next.

My entire life I was literally scared of everything. Every guy that passed me on the street (still dealing with this one). Stair wells, parking garages, elevators, being alone, being with people, family, friends, friends of friends, the dark, I could literally go on and on! I spent every second of everyday scared, all because someone decided to hurt me as a child. PTSD never crossed my mind. I thought that was something only service members got diagnosed with. I never told anyone of my abuse until I was in my 20s, but even then I didn’t deal with it. I didn’t date until I was out of high school because I was so uncomfortable around men. If I ever met someone that didn’t scare me, I KNEW they must have been a good person, because that NEVER happened! It wasn’t until I turned 30 that I went to a therapist and started to deal with what happened to me. I am finally living a somewhat normal life. I still have many fears, but I don’t spend everyday terrified of life and things that COULD happen. For that I am very thankful!

When I was 15 I was sexually assaulted for the the first time at park that is very close to my house. I unfortunately have to drive pass it almost everyday to get to work, the store etc+.
Even though it’s been almost 6 years I can’t shake the feeling of going to panic mode and feeling absolutely sick every time I have to drive by it. Also due to being a small town there’s not really many alternative routes I can take to avoid it.
Luckily when ever ever my friends have ask if I ever want to go to that park (or almost any park for that matter bc a lot of the local parks in my town I associate with traumatic memories) they don’t pry and ask why.
I guess what I’m looking for is any advice to could possibly help alleviate any anxiety from this.

She has broken up with me twice; the second time was very traumatic and sudden, and I am still getting over it. I have developed PTSD as a result of being involved with her. 

The mere thought of returning to university induces a panic attack; she is likely to ignore me (which she’s done often in the past) and this too causes panic attacks. 

She acts very charming and happy with everyone in the class, and even seeing her do this makes me feel anxious. Her entire presence causes me stress and anxiety. The sight of the university building causes me anxiety. Everything to do with her and the university makes me ill. 

I am worried about going back there, and I’m starting to think I’m not able to.

I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years back because of extended trauma going back from elementary school all the way through to college. When I was diagnosed, I had actually sought out therapy for depression but due to some conversations with friends and the things I was currently studying in my Stress and Trauma class (I was a psych major) I realized that I fit almost every symptom listed for the PTSD diagnosis as well. 

I had been receiving therapy through my university's health program which allowed for a certain number of free visits every semester. But then my therapist left the university clinic and went into private practice. I continued to see her, but I couldn't afford the insurance copay and eventually stopped my visits altogether. On paper the fees were reasonable, but all my financial info was based on the fact that I was technically still considered my mom's dependent. In reality, she only paid for my insurance and I was living in poverty while trying to go to school because I was receiving pretty much no help from my family and couldn't find work. 

From then until just a few months ago, I wasn't receiving any treatment for my mental health issues. Last year was rather hellish for me. I was in a much better situation financially, I lived in a better apartment, had a job, and in a lot of other ways my life was objectively better. But emotionally, I was suffering. It hadn't been that bad for me since I had escaped the awful home life that traumatized me in the first place.

It took a lot of mental energy in a time where I didn't have much, but at my lowest point I finally researched therapy offices in my area. I got married two years ago and my partner's insurance covers most of the cost. Plus, we're fortunate enough that I can afford it without having to worry about still being able to eat afterwards, unlike when I was in college. So I called and made an appointment. 

That was back in October. I'm now going through CPT (cognitive processing therapy). It's really fucking hard, but so far it has absolutely been worth it. I'm putting a lot more time and effort into improving myself. I've been much more productive. I'm doing things I used to love again. Things that used to seem a distant dream or completely unachievable now feel like they might be things I can tackle - if not now, then *someday*. I'm more hopeful than I've probably ever been. My partner has been unbelievably supportive and has said they're really proud of me for all the work I've been doing. 

I'm not quite there, yet. It's still a struggle. But I'm making it. I feel like I can do this. And I hope that all of you reading this can claim some happiness for yourselves, too. 

Much love ~

A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn’t stand with out pain.
For the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I’d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I’d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn’t go in I’d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn’t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.
Because I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time

Iv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can’t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don’t really talk in therapy session and the reply’s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school

There’s an emotion I feel when I’m in a state sometimes, it’s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it’s like there’s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there’s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I’m experiencing and I’m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can’t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.

^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^

It’s only been a year and a half since I discovered I had repressed my father’s sexual abuse. I pretty much blanked on much of my early life before going to school; my elementary years were marked by extreme fear and neuroticism; from junior high on I was numb and depressed. Understanding my father now as a pedophile, narcissist, and abuser has been the missing key to explaining so much about my life. Now I’m trying to recondition my behavior to be adaptive instead of maladaptive, which means piecing together the origins of my fears and anxieties.

As a child, I hated dolls and sought the comfort of stuffed animals instead. As an adult with overt PTSD, I notice I have a heavy preference for non-human animal company. I struggle with some misanthropy. Was my doll phobia related to the sexual abuse? Did I see myself as a doll in some way? I was super triggered by the movie The Exorcist, and as an adult, I see so many commonalities with child sexual abuse.

I also had a phobia of mirrors. Whenever I would brush my teeth, I was terrified that when I looked down to spit and looked back up, my face would be different, or someone would be behind me. As an adult, I realize I never had a stable sense of self. My existence was always conditional (on appeasing my abuser). And I wasn’t allowed to have my own will, not when it conflicted with his. As I’ve become more comfortable with myself, mirrors scare me less. This one makes sense to me.

The cockroach one can probably be explained by some traumatic instances with roaches. I remember being at Fuddruckers, there being a cockroach on the wall and me being concerned but my family ignoring me, and later the cockroach being in my burger. Things get foggy after that... I don’t remember if I took a bite of the burger. Another possibility is that my father abused me in a roach-infested place, like the office building he forced us to work in. I remember having to spend nights there and being terrified of the giant flying roaches. 

Has anyone been able to figure out their childhood phobias? I also had some OCD behavior in the bathroom, like counting down from flushing the toilet and washing my hands, or getting up from the bath to dry off and get dressed— I had to do it within the countdown otherwise “the monsters would get me.”"	[]	[{'start': 131, 'end': 152, 'span': 'father’s sexual abuse', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1973, 'end': 2061, 'span': 'I remember having to spend nights there and being terrified of the giant flying roaches.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

It triggered my from my assault back in November. Mostly I'm fine, which is why I guess I didn't expect to be affected like this. I cried most of the way through that episode and then off and on since watching it. I'm left feeling awful. I wanted to see what other people are saying about it, and everyone is saying that they thought it was great. They're so happy that the show touched on this topic. But it made me so angry. I wouldn't ever expect the characters to turn away someone for that reason, but I'm most upset that despite initially not having anything to go off of, they magically are able to find evidence? When I was assaulted and went to the police, they essentially told me that they couldn't do anything because he hadn't raped me. The show made me so angry because it was just so easy for her, in a world where her end is so rare.

I have been diagnosed by 2 adolescent physiatrists and now I am being forced by the court system to attend reunification therapy with her which is terrible. I always feel unsafe and am on red alert. My mother has narcissistic personality disorder and cannot accept that I have ptsd. Is it because deep down she knows that she abused me. Also she has never admitted to anyone but me that she has abused me and claims that I am making everything up.

I appreciate whoever is reading this right now, it means a lot to me.

I still care a lot about my ex. I know a lot of people would say stay away, they’re not your issue anymore but I simply cannot leave them because I care.

My ex has been through a lot. Child abuse, job at 15 to pay off the house, texts from her dad all the time after he left about how much he hates her, sexually assaulted twice, sexually abused, physically abused, abortion, etc.

Is there any advice out there, I would gladly take any. I had issues with fully understanding her situation, but I really want to be able to know what to do when she gets into a bad headspace and everything. Everyday is so sad for her and I’m not sure how to be there for her. 

I listen to everything she says and give her validation but I’m not really sure what to do after that. I’ll make sure she’s not in pain, be there in person when she needs me, and everything I could try.

But there must be something I can do. I would love any advice or ideas that would cheer her up after having flashbacks or having really bad headspace moments."

665ae4a2c2815b2a78502f1e	806_ptsd	"Is this ptsd? So to preface, I had an accident last year that involved me breaking my shoulder. I knocked the humeral head off the shaft and it was hanging together by the muscle. I then broke it two more times in the span of six months. The third time was a surgery where they had to break it and pin/plate it together after a malunion. 

Ever since surgery I’ve had several severe nightmares. Lately they’ve become a nightly occurrence. I feel the pain all over again, and I wake up crying/in a panic. Anytime I hear a plane flying I get very nauseous and I feel like I’m gonna pass out. A plane had caused my horse to panic and they threw me off, causing the initial break. The thought of even getting on a horse again is impossible, but I was raised around them. When I see my scar from surgery (the doctor left my staples in too long and my skin grew over some of them, causing more scarring), I feel very very upset. I can’t wear tank tops anymore because I just can’t stand seeing it. I haven’t told my therapist about this (I’m in therapy for other mental issues) because this all feels silly.

I fell from approximately 50 ft and was kept alive by my two best friends until I was loaded into a helicopter five hours later. I lost seven teeth, crushed the right side of my face and broke my left humerus. While it's not ideal, I've accepted this moment in my life and the results of it. In a roundabout way, it's lead to one of my best friends meeting his now-fiancee and put me on a positive direction in life as opposed to bouncing around from job to job.

Over the past couple of years I dealt with roughly one dream a week reliving the experience and waking up in a panic. For the past year I've been going to a rock climbing gym and the dreams have largely stopped. I still avoid ladders and other heights, but I'm comfortable on the rock wall. I'm not as daring as others there, and it really limits the difficulty of climbs I can complete because I don't put myself out there as much as I could to make the more difficult moves. Sometimes I fall, but it's generally expected. Or I jump off because I'm worn out. 

Today I had an unexpected fall. It was only from about 7ft, but my foot slipped, just like it did in my accident. I hit the ground awkwardly, but unhurt and didn't stop shaking for an hour. I was on the verge of tears as I left the gym and bought a pack of cigarettes (I've been on an ecig for a few months). To top it off, I had to go in for a work meeting where the manager tore into us for the general decline in standards that's occurred lately, which is a whole other story.

I don't know what to do. I'm still on edge, and I don't want to sleep because I know I'll have a dream where I fall, or I lose my teeth, or crush my face or something. I was doing so well, and I know it's just a bad day, but I'm terrified that this step back will have more of an impact. I just need someone who's been here before to tell me something that helps."

I went to jail when I was 15 for no reason got out in a little over a week after being in max and a lower security sector once they realised I was innocent. Apparently I was their for investigation. I do not care to share details. But I am in america where we are told we are innocent until proven guilty. I learned the opposite is true.

 I am now 20 and freak out when i see cop cars and I often have dreams of the police arresting and my friends taking me or us to jail or raiding my house. I even hate hearing the sirens in songs and i especially hate seeing a combo of red and blue lights. I often wake up from those dreams completely out of breath and sometimes crying and very scared until I realized it was a dream. This is all embarrassing for me. 

Do people with ptsd have these similar experiences or am I over reacting to having night mares slightly often? Maybe everyone is afraid of seeing cops? I just would like everyones opinions on if they think I have a problem or not and what kind of professional I should talk to. I am sorry but I know nothing about any of this.

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot.

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*but I did not comprehend.*

*Jacket-less, I shivered as the rain began pouring.*

*The memory fades.* 

*I came back to myself.*

*The blood cried out the horror,*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*It cried these things to me and many more.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions* 

*with no one there to answer them.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My mom, my brother, my step-father waiting.*

*Mom sobbing as we embraced.* 

*The bullet pierced my heart again*

*My father was not the only one shot that day.*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

*The car stopped, and the dam broke.*

*Blood, tears, and terror erupted from within.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I understand now, truth at a bitter price,*

*that fear is a sacred thing*

*and always has been and always will be.*

Tl;dr: I experienced stuff that I'm not sure qualifies as traumatic? Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. 

Hey Everyone,   
First time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   


1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. 
2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. 
3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him ""If you're gonna hit me, do it!"" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said ""Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her"". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me ""oh I fight with my brothers too!"" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. 
4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. 
5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that ""if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault"".   


In my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole ""PTSD"" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   
Idk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this. Any comments appreciated."

5e84c792bde837092ec273de	560_ptsd	"Probably destroyed a close friendship (TW: hurtful therapy experiences, sexual abuse, suicide) Long text, I'm sorry for that :/ I didn't know where else to talk about this. I think I was an asshole but I didn't know what else to do. Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker. 

So, I have/had a friend that was very supportive and understanding and really helpful in the past. I absolutely honor what he did for me. 
But a while ago, he was less and less understanding, to a point where I felt he defended my abusers by making excuses for them. For context, for a few years I was kept in hospitals that did a lot of harmful and highly unethical ""treatment"" and I couldn't get out of it, I had no chance to get out of there. When that started, I was already slightly traumatized by events before, and the longer I was kept in hospital, the more suicidal I got. It was absolute horror for me and ever since I am terrified by doctors. 
He told me things like ""they surely had their reasons for that"" or ""oh, people simply make mistakes"". Especially the ""they had reasons for that"" really really hurt me. 

I then decided to talk to him an tell him, that it hurts when he does that, and ask him if he either could stop talking like that or that we might not talk about this topic at all. He apologized that he made me feel that way, but that we just have different opinions on parts of this. Now, this is the point where I probably got unfair. His girlfriend was sexually abused, and I am really really sorry that has happened to her.  What I shouldn't have done, but did, was asking him directly if he would tell her, that the guy surely had his reasons for that or just made a mistake. I know he is very emotionally involved and takes her pain as well and hates that asshole. It was unfair to compare it and remind him of that pain and hate. My trauma isn't that obvious, and I absolutely don't want to compare it. Whatever reason caused it, is valid, and the outcome is equally bad. Absolutely no discussion on this. But I felt like he didn't take me that serious because they were medical professionals who just made some mistakes. I apologized for what I said to him, but got no more answers. Think I fucked it up completely and hate myself for that.

I have a bunch of debt, no sense of self, university dropout and no idea what I want in life. 

The only thing I want to do is travel but I don't make enough. I want to backpack Europe but even for that I'd need a good few thousand. 

Today, I got fired from my job. I wasn't the best employee but I spoke french and English which most others couldn't and I we had occasional french customers, I was early, I was fast on the cash register, I followed the dress code and didn't stand around talking for 40 mins where most others barely did that... managers included.. 

There were 4 managers and I had no problem with the first 3. The 4th one was a narc that totally triangulated the other 3 against me and I noticed a shift in their attitudes towards me after she decided to have a vendetta against me. She would constantly minimize me, be passive aggressive, push only my breaks back but no one else's and nit pick me to a T. Other employees agreed that they saw this happening. 

Today I woke up feeling amazing after a deep sleep meditation on YouTube- only to get fired as they told me right before my shift. This really shook me and made my PTSD worse and I've felt like crap all day today... It was the only thing that helped me build motivation, my job. It's this constant cycle of me barely surviving and then other people tearing me apart. 

Ive suffered severe attachment traumas. I have never had parents there for me, never had true friends, never had a boyfriend or a true love interest in my life. I've been used by narcissists sexually, mentally and emotionally. My mom has used my mind against me. I can't find real friends. I can't even connect to my
True self it seems. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm in this trance like fog state and I can't think right. I need to get away from the narc mom I live with but I don't make enough and now being fired I definitely don't make enough.

I guess I should look for a new more full time job but it's really hard keeping a job because I keep a) attracting narcissists who can't be pleased or b) my depression and PTSD gets perceived as bitchiness/ laziness, despite that I do try. 

I guess being on meds would help but I don't know the necessary steps to obtain them without family doctor  ( I live in Ontario Canada)

I was diagnosed with PTSD because I grew up in a very abusive home with drug addicts and alcoholics. My family is very twisted so I avoid them at all cost but my mother recently revealed that I ""may have been"" (her words) sexually assaulted by my uncle, who molested her. I witnessed him attempt to molest her when I was younger, so I don't doubt this.

He was a very abusive to my family (we lived with him on/off till I was 15) because he was a mean drunk and would cut phone cords and start physical fights with my grandparents and my mom. I remember he used to tie me up with duct tape and cover my mouth and would keep me in his room. I don't remember if anything happened but after my experience with sleep paralysis - I'm kind of messed up and feel like I do remember now. 

I hope I am making sense because I am on high-alert right now.

I felt my mind wake up but I couldn't move my body. I felt like something was in the room and it was trying to confine/take me with blankets. I felt it actually trying to confine me. I felt its hands touching me. At first, I thought it was little gremlins, but then I thought of my uncle, and I attempted to scream for help. I kept trying to move my body but I was stuck.

It's been 4 hours since that happened and I am terrified and I feel violated and sick. I'm not sure what is going on. But I feel alone, sad, scared, and like I don't want to try anymore. I just feel so sick and confused and like an epiphany exploded in my head.

6662bbd11599452943304086	821_ptsd	"PTSD from Witnessing Pet Cruelty TW animal cruelty, animal torture, animal death

I'm pretty new to the idea of me having PTSD, since I always thought of PTSD in the context of war/physical harm. However, in the past two years, I think I've pinpointed that my emotional issues stem from a specific incidence of trauma from when I was a kid, but I'm doubting if this memory was actually 'traumatic enough'. 

When I was around 7 years old, I had a pet parakeet. My older brother, around 14 at the time, offered me a quarter if he could have my her. In my mind, since we lived in the same house, he could have the bird but she would still be here in the house, so it didnt matter. I don't remember much of the events that happened after that moment, but I remember that he had had a friend over and they were joking around. Anyways, we had the kind of glass windows that shut closed. At some point, my brother put the bird in the windowsill and smashed the glass slider against her, basically killing her violently. 

I believe I suppressed this memory, or blocked out most of it, since I don't remember much of what happened afterwards. 

I'm making this post because I have told only one person in my life about this situation, and while she is incredibly supportive and helpful with my emotional issues, I still feel in the back of my mind that this /isn't/ PTSD, and my issues don't stem from this experience at all. 

For the entirety of my life, I have felt an extreme, often paranoid fear of people close to me hurting me physically or even killing me. I am currently seeing a wonderful guy, but I feel like I have PTSD glasses on and am searching obsessively for signs that he's a sociopath. This obsessive fear, of someone close to me turning out to be a sociopath/someone who will violently hurt me, has been a ever present theme in my life, and I am wondering if this worry is directly caused by the experience with the bird, or if it's coming from something else.

6662bbd11599452943304086	1265_ptsd	"Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. 

Going to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. 

I was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.

I dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. 

I dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.

Honestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.

I feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. 

It's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. 

But still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. 

I'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.

I know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. 

**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks.

6662bbd11599452943304086	1294_counseling	"My fiancée suffers from severe anxiety and depression. She has had it most of her life. Her anxiety in public places is the worst. It gets to points where she can't breathe or move. Sometimes, she won't even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She won't eat or drink in public. If she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her. She is so scared that I can't even get her to drive. She doesn't want to get her license because she's scared of trying to drive.

Some people have recommended medication, but I believe it's just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. I don't want my fiancée pumped with drugs. I believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. When we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. She took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. She slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better.

5b5504e902660200017948c3	1359_ptsd	"From ok to 0 in about 2 seconds I have a bunch of traumatic things that have happened to me while I was growing up (sexual abuse from family members, a long-term emotionally abusive relationship that has thankfully ended, and continually high pressure from my family to perform and has been very verbally abusive).

Previously I’ve been able to cope extremely well and sort of swept all of this under the rug. I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life’s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.

2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I’m seeing therapists but they haven’t put down a diagnosis yet) as I’m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I’ve had to stop work for the moment because I can’t cope.

I am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner’s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.

It’s father’s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven’t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it’s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don’t resolve any issues. And it’s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn’t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it’s taken a full toll on me.

The relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn’t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father’s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad’s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn’t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I’m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I’m terrified about my future and whether I’ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I’m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn’t that good to start with. My parents don’t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).

Right now I don’t feel safe and I don’t know what to do. This post didn’t really have a question - I am just massively triggered right now and want to vent my story anonymously. Thanks for reading."

I'm currently 17 years old and after research I seem to have almost every single symptom of PTSD. The main reason I found this is because anytime I am yelled at by anyone (mainly parents) I instantly go into full panic mode and it feels like my whole body freezes up. This happens even when I know they aren't trying to yell at me but are just raising their voice. The reason I am confused is because I cannot remember a traumatic event in my life that would be substantial enough to cause something like this. The symptoms I experience that may or may not be connected to PTSD include:

Fear and avoidance of situations where either being yelled at or being made fun of is a possibility
Extreme social anxiety to the point where it is difficult for me to make new friends outside of my group and has caused me to avoid relationships because I am afraid of rejection/being laughed at by the school
Paranoia involving being attacked or bad things happening to family members even though I live in a suburb that never has crime
Difficulty sleeping with no specific cause, usually at night I just am constantly in my thoughts playing out millions of different scenarios in my head
Feelings of isolation, mainly that I am somehow not like everyone else because of all these symptoms and my ADHD diagnosis, this causes me to isolate myself and run away from problems such as walking away from a conversation with my parents if I get yelled at for something
And finally the strongest symptom I have is constantly replaying bad moments in my life or imagining bad things that have never happened

Unrelated to these symptoms I find that I struggle with addiction/self damaging behavior as just 6 months ago I finally was able to stop smoking weed daily (after a consecutive 4 months straight) due to the fact that it relieved many of these negative feelings. The only reason I was able to stop was because I was caught being high by my parents and immediately had a panic attack that ended up with an ambulance ride to the hospital."

For almost 3 years now I've been struggling with a PTSD that I got from being assaulted in public twice in a row in the span of 2 months. Since this was pretty public and the public was very apathetic to it it caused me to feel very worthless. I felt a lot of resentment for other people. Since then I've had anger issues. I got pretty good at hiding this though. 

&amp;#x200B;

In these last 3 years violence has played a big part in my routine mental thought. If I was mad at someone, even for the slightest smallest ""infractions"" towards me, I would fantasize about hurting them in some way. Life was mostly good, but I'd spent hours pacing around my apartment thinking about how people had ""crossed"" me that day, and how they were going to pay for it. It is really scary stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until today I always had to put in concious effort to stop when I caught myself having these involuntary fantasies. But today, for the first time, I caught myself in a fantasy and reflexively got myself out of it. It almost feels like my body finally realizes that I don't actually live a violent life, and that I can tackle my problems in other, healthier ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned to function with my PTSD for a long time now (therapy yay!), but this feels like the biggest step towards recovery yet. I really hope this trend continues, because sometimes I'm still afraid that one day I might slip up, and do something that I would regret. Luckily that hasn't happened yet, and things seem to get easier with time.

Have any of you folks ever felt like they where ""stuck"" in a violent state of mind? How do you guys cope with it?  Are you guys hopeful for a full recovery or do you believe that PTSD is something you have to learn to live with?

One went off to school and was dealing with his own suicidal feelings and anxiety. My other brother who is 8 years older than me was living at home (and still is). During that period of time the house was basically his. He was a drug addict. Lied and stole. We constantly had a parade of different people in the house that abused me in some way or another. My brother's abusive girlfriend lived with us. It seemed like it was just me, him, her and whatever person was staying in our basement at the time. They used to beat the crap out of each other. He was abusive emotionally and verbally and I remember mostly just hiding under a desk when I got home and just zoning out or not going home. I was a pretty square kid because I didn't want to be like my brother and got bullied a lot for that and I guess my ""dyke"" vibes or whatever (kids threw rocks at me at school-- kinda biblical).   


I put all of these feelings aside for the longest time. And by ""put aisde"" I mean, I didn't deal with them and they caused a lot of problems in my development and relationships.

Now. My brother only drinks and smokes cigarettes. Lives with my parents and is pretty nice and gets help for his OCD. I do not live with my family. I moved across the country and it proved to pretty much help me to be away from them all. Problem is for me. Right now. Is that my brother has changed. But he teases me for being over sensitive and having a temper with him. He loves to tease me and I get so frustrated that I cry and feel myself since it's the same house wanting to crawl under a desk when he does this.   


How do you tell someone that you recognize that they have changed but, you are unable to forgive them (at least mentally because I know I can never physically forgive him due to my body having a will of its own) and that they can not have that teasing sibling relationship with you because you traumatized me too much. My brother is not a responsible person and is pretty condescending and problematic and we fight constantly....   


I don't know what to do but, I am staying here currently until January because I live very far up North (the last town before the next town is a fly in town in the Yukon) and I need to wait for the river to completely freeze to cross it to get home. Wasn't planned. I can feel myself just getting worse.

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

\-Backstory Time

My mother was married four times, and her third husband, was addicted to pills. I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. 

My mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. 

I know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.

My mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-It's all downhill from here folks.

So how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Almost up to speed

I have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. 

It was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.

I haven’t been offically diagnosed with PTSD or even know where or who can give me an offical diagnosis, but I’ve read posts on here and can relate to some...

Is it possible to have PTSD from being a CSA survivor and seeing my mom dead? 

I’m a CSA survivor, the abuser being my biological grandfather on my late mom’s side of the family. The abuse (molested) started in preschool and didn’t stop until December 2015 or 2016. 

In addition to being a CSA survivor, I lost my mom May 30th, 2019. She had multiple health issues before my brother and I were born and got worse over the last 10 years. For reference my brother was born in July 1998 and I was born in February 2000. Anyways, I had a dream I watched her die of a heart attack and sure enough 3 days later she died, most likely of a heart attack. My dad and I had gone to the store and when we got back she was face down on the floor, next to her bed. We had only been out for 40-50 minutes. I had my brother call 911 while I took our dogs in my room so the paramedics could do their thing. I knew she was gone soon as I saw her body. After I don’t know how much time passed she was declared dead. I still had to stay with the dogs because of the medical examiners and funeral home people, so after some more time passed we shut the door to my parents room so I could talk with our pastor and cry with my family. Soon as I saw the foot of the body bag I walked to my room with my back turned to it. I didn’t want to see her get rolled out... but just when I thought the funeral people had already taken her outside, I turned around. It was a mistake. I saw her face in the body bag as they rolled her out and no matter how much everything told me to look away, I couldn’t. 

Ever since then I’ve had countless dreams where I see her die, see my friends go missing and/or end up dead, and see my dad die. I also experience flashbacks that replay the scene of the night she died. I also have flashbacks to when I was molested even though it’s been almost 3 years since it stopped. I don’t know what’s wrong with me because when the flashbacks start, they don’t stop."

I was severely manipulated by my ex to believe things on top of being sexually abused and emotionally.

Right now I am suffering from feeling guilty (blaming myself for being manipulated), ashamed, feeling like my life is unclean etc.. mostly due to the manipulation. Is PTSD a possible culprit?

I have a supportive boyfriend who does everything and more to reassure me that manipulation wasn't my fault, that I was young.. that I was dependent and would believe anything my ex said. I still feel guilty, like it's all my fault. I am looking to know if anyone else had experiences like this.

6654877eb81283bb7e295476	331_counseling	I agree with Cory. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) does seem to help a lot of people who struggle with anxiety. It's not the only type of therapy that can help, but it seems to help people in a way that is more natural and realistic. As Cory mentioned, anxiety is something that is part of life, so therapies that indicate we can get rid of it are questionable. Our natural inclination when we have anxiety is to STOP any and all things that may cause it or provoke it. We do this because we think it will help, but it actually doesn't. Anxiety usually has us rehashing the past or rehearsing the future while ignoring the present. ACT helps folks who have those kinds of tendencies. Be well..Robin J.

My condition is lifelong and requires annual checkups to track growth (not cancer but behaves similairly). It's my first progress checkup since the initial crisis coming this week. I need to undergo a series of tests and scans at the hospital thatost everything happened at followed by a visit with the doctor that treated me. All of this over the course of two days. Now my wife and I are in the middle of a cross country move. We're moving in about 4 weeks and am wondering if it would be best for my PTSD to get my checkup after we move. The scans and tests can be done anywhere and in today's day and age my doctor can review them and consult with me remotely. Also it's not going to hurt me to wait the few weeks. I'm non symptomatic. I'm just thinking more in terms of what would be best for my PTSD. Should I get everything done at the original hospital this week and face my fears? Or would it just do more damage to my fragile mental state and early stages of recovery? I don't want to feel like I'm running away but I don't want to cause more harm by going. Not sure what to do.

6654877eb81283bb7e295476	564_ptsd	"I am a college student and I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment. Help Long story, but read if you can. 

I came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. 

About a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. 

Lots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. 

The day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. 

I woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear ""COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said ""one sec"" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. 

During this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. 

The main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.

I explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. 

After the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. 

I showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. 

Since I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. 

It got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. 

Do I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. 

I miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. 

anything will help. "	[]	[{'start': 55, 'end': 83, 'span': 'police raid in my apartment.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1274, 'end': 1343, 'span': 'COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!!', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

6654877eb81283bb7e295476	1070_ptsd	Why I have ptsd.. When I was in middle school, I was bullied a lot. Physically. I've been assaulted a few times from women when I was a teenager. I remember in 5th grade I got off the bus and two women jumped me, broke my nose and left me bloody.. a few months later another woman assaulted me at school, and would throw me against the locker(she was much older than me). I also got in multiple fights with people and I saw some fucked up shit like a cat getting ripped to shreds by my own dog.. After that I would see dead animals on the side of the road and break down in tears. I was a bully in school too. always built with rage. One time a kid jumped on my back and bit my shoulder and In response I body slammed him on the concrete because he freaked me out. I put him in the hospital and his dad threatened to kill me (I was 13, He was in his 40's). I was going to be charged with assault even though I was defending myself unless I wrote my bully a letter saying that I'm sorry. The reason I was in the wrong is because I'm a huge dude and he was half my size. It was fucking stupid. I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive. I left town when I was 18 and moved to Seattle, got a job at McDonald's and started therapy. I had a suicide attempt that same year and that put me in the hospital for a few weeks. I left my job at McDonald's a few weeks later, got a job at amazon and started making something of myself. But I struggle around people, I always have. My coping mechanism is painting, I'm an artist outside of work and it's something I care deeply about. I'm thinking of leaving Amazon to become an artist because that's what I want to do. I don't care if it's hard, I've had a lifetime of hardship so I know what hard is. Anyways this is more of a rant than an explanation. I had a very abusive childhood and it's made me have thick skin, It's why I am the man I am..

6654877eb81283bb7e295476	244_ptsd	Physical symptoms? I got a tentative diagnosis of PTSD at the end of last year by my therapist, and have been going to therapy on and off for a while now. I have nightmares sometimes, and panic attacks pretty often, but I also started passing out and ‘losing time’ and I’m not sure if it’s related to PTSD or if it’s a different thing, so I’m wondering if anyone here has had any related symptoms. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post it, but honestly you guys seem like a good community (this is more or less a throwaway, but I’ve been lurking for a while on another account). And I know that it says no medical advice, and I don’t know if this would really fall into it- I’m seeing a doctor regularly, and I don’t want advice about what to do more than just wanting to know if this is something other people experience. Anyways, when I black out it doesn’t feel at all like a panic attack, my vision goes dark while when I have a panic attack my vision goes bright and everything looks white. Also, during panic attacks I feel over sensitive/ every sense seems alarmingly heightened, but when I pass out it just feels like I completely lose control, everything goes black and I can feel myself falling and then I wake up. Ive checked with my doctor to see if it could be caused by heart problems as they run in the family, but all results came back completely normal. Honestly I didn’t even think of it being related to PTSD until a friend suggested it. Along with passing out, there has also been days where I look at the time and realize that somehow four or five hours passed by without me recalling any of it. I don’t use any substances, and honestly it’s a fairly scary experience and I don’t know if any of you have felt anything like that that ended up being related to PTSD. Thanks in advance!

My therapist said that I need to imagine a safe place to store this stuff where I can recall it and safely place it back in the “box” when I’m done with working on it in EMDR. my problem is that this imaginary box is hard for because visualizing this and working it the way she wants me to work with it doesn’t seem to work.

So.. this is mostly me sharing my story in a community of seemingly supportive people and then posing a question at the end.

To start, I'm a trans man and the events I'm discussing all occured when I identified as female, as a child. 
As all kids do, my sister and I would play pretend. She's about 2 years older than me, and we were always very nerdy, we would play as star trek characters or something and run around outside, sometimes we'd play as Mario characters. I was the younger sibling so I'd always get stuck playing the boy bc sis wanted to play as a girl. Eventually the Mario playing turned sexual, but here's the thing, we never actually touched each other, it would always be one of us just sitting on the other and stuff like that. It's very rare for me to remember things that happened to me when I was a child because of how badly I was bullied and beaten in school. (A kid damaged my eye so badly that my vision is damaged for life and I have to wear glasses.) This leads me to believe u have ptsd because I block out like all of school from my memories. Anyway, the events with sis went on until I was probably 12 or 13, her being 14-16. I'm 16 now and I can't imagine thinking its acceptable to play with a kid in that way. To describe it better it basically turned into roleplaying. We would act out sex with the motions and sounds but never actually do more than grind basically. Can someone please help? Should I get therapy? Was it rape? Would this contribute if I did have trauma and now developed ptsd? Thank you for reading."

60ce1bb05ba62827bfaa0ad3	1199_ptsd	"I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**



**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7"" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2"" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.

Fast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  

Another episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.

I know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.

Sorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.

**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**

Background on me: PTSD diagnosed , childhood trauma, I don’t remember a lot of my childhood and continue (as an adult) to go into black out mode when things get tough. I am a virgin who plans to stay one till marriage because of sexual trauma. 

I dated a guy for three months who lied a lot. It was the peak of my drinking problem (70 something days sober). I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend. He would drink nothing. I would go in my room thinking I passed out but we would still do sexual things that was not sex. Remember I am a virgin. 

One night I got so drunk I don’t remember making it to bed. He knew how much I drank. He never said anything. If anything encouraged by buying alcohol for me and my roommate. I woke up the next day with awful vaginal pain. When I peed it felt like my insides were ripped and I had blood in my urine. That lasted for three days before slowly fading away. When I asked my ex about it he said he used three fingers and that’s why. I didn’t think anything of it. 

I got drunk a few more times but not blackout and we do things again. I try to set boundaries with him about it realizing I needed to and he texted me “I didn’t rape you” I didn’t think anything of it because rape is such a triggering thing. I shut it down super quick. 

I don’t know if this is rape or not because when I would get drunk I would ask to have sex but he would say no. He knew I wanted to wait and he wanted to be a good boyfriend. But the three finger excuse didn’t make sense because we consensually used that many before and it didn’t feel that way. I didn’t feel torn and I didn’t bleed. Do you think he waited till I was so unconscious to do something? I didn’t bring up rape in the text but he jumped right in like he was ready to defend himself. I understand it’s a rough accusation but I don’t understand why he jumped to it.  

Do you think this sounds like rape?"

60ce1bb05ba62827bfaa0ad3	1345_ptsd	How do I get passed it? So I recently had oral cancer. (History:physically and mentally abusive childhood, abandonment, bullied, depression, self harm). After my surgery, a hole appeared in the floor of my mouth. A surgeon came into my 6 bed bay at 2am and using local anaesthetic stitched up the floor of my mouth by a flashlight that her assistant was holding, she stabbed me through the lip (which wasn't numbed) a couple of times and the next day I found out she hadn't done it properly and still had a hole. The surgeon  wanted me to go under General and get it sorted but I was too scared and so let it heal naturally which took 3 weeks on NG tube which made me sick. I have bad veins also and was stabbed numerous times every day by people trying to find veins for canulars or to take bloods. 2 doctors gave me a nose bleed because they were trying to very forcefully shove a large NG tube that was the wrong size up my nose. My dietician  restricted my water and I had severe dehydration headaches all weekend while she was off and no one would up my water intake because her word is law or whatever. Anyway long story short, it was a lash up and lots of horrible things happened to me along with just trying to deal with getting cancer and going through treatment. So since then I have nightmares every night, I can't sleep, I grind my teeth all day getting angry at how (I've tried) but can't get any help for what happened to me and psychological help. So it didn't really click until I went for an eye test and they did the glaucoma air pressure test and I completely broke down. I was so embarrassed because the lady doing it clearly didn't get it, it's only a burst of air to the eye, it doesn't hurt. Which I get. But to me, it was another test, another thing being done to me in a kind of medical setting and I just couldn't handle it and lost my shit.

New member here. 
Basically went through some very rough stuff throughout childhood and witnessed very scary domestic abuse between my parents. Lots of yelling (my dad can be very scary) hitting in front of me, etc.
To this day my parents are still married and the physical fighting has subsided, yet they will still get into a yelling/ door slamming match every now and then that just sends me into tears despite being 20 years old. I still hate all forms of yelling/voice raising. Even when my mom is just calling a sibling from the other room, I shudder at the sound of just her yelling. 

The other night, I was smoking with my sister and her friends. I used to be a frequent smoker, nearly everyday mostly and every single day occasionally for a few months here and there, mostly to deal with depression and such. However we were taking dabs, which I have taken before without this effect, but clearly I got much more high a lot quicker than from a bowl or blunt. Anyway, I proceeded to go lay on the couch in my basement and I SWORE I could hear my dad clear as day screaming at my mom. I knew I was super high and scared, but over and over I would hear his voice in my head. I went upstairs and checked, they were completely fast asleep.

Was this some form of ptsd that was triggered by being high? Is this possible? I just felt so scared and my heart was beating extremely hard at the sheer thought of my dad yelling.

60ce1bb05ba62827bfaa0ad3	1504_ptsd	"Telling about the abuse Warning, possible triggers!

When I was 12, I was groomed and molested by my Grandfather. Admittedly this is really hard for me to write down as I've yet to really accept and work through what has happened. Even if it's been 6 years. 

2 months ago I was watching a Video about psychology (as I do almost everyday) and the topic was about the Sexual abuse that can occur with children without them realising that what's happening is wrong and scarring. That hit the nail in the coffin and the realisation hit me like a train. I wanted to throw up, curl in a ball and scream, and cry.... After 2 months of torture on my part I finally told my mum. While this happened my grandfather(abuser) frequently visits and calls almost everyday. I get panic attacks everytime it's brought up or if I'm reminded of it in some way... The guilt and shame is killing me. So it's really hard for me to express and talk about my feeling about my... Situation

I can't take it anymore. I can't stand to even think about that pedophile let alone be in the same room as him. So I've cut off ties, not answering the phone or hiding etc. My grandmother started meddling (It's typical behaviour for that part of the family) and won't stop asking questions no matter how much I tell her to leave it. So she started asking my dad questions and he doesn't take well to them. 

So this brings me to my current dilemma. I don't know if I should tell my father and/or How I should tell him. I'm stuck in a corner and this could destroy my family. I don't even know if they'll believe me or not! My family sort of despise me because I'm Granddaddy's favourite (ain't that ironic?) 

Mum really helps a lot but she's not always there to help me out of the situations. So I'm turning to you for advice, Reddit. 

Please, any advice on this would be greatly appreciate. I know this might not be the best subreddit to ask this but.... You're my only hope now."	[]	[{'start': 76, 'end': 115, 'span': 'groomed and molested by my Grandfather.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
666235184d066a268d7143c5	956_ptsd	"PTSD court treatment update #2: The Euphoria is wearing off and reality is setting in. It’s not all bad, but it’s not all good. It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

I've seen and intervened in my fair share of fights. Last week was different though. I came out of my room after dismissal and saw two boys going after another in the hallway. Teachers were already there, but the campus security was outside dealing with another fight. Right as I entered the hallway the two boys started swinging at the other. The teachers tried to apprehend the two, so I went and grabbed the other one holding him up against the wall.

What I didn't realize is that I had grabbed the one who didn't want the fight to happen, so when the two boys broke free from the other teachers I ended up being a human shield. It's all a blur after that, I just remember them yelling in my face and throwing fists at me and the boy I was protecting. Eventually, other people got involved, but I couldn't move or I was putting the boy in more danger. The only injury I have is a bruise inside my lip, but after my adrenaline settled it triggered some other trauma I have from my parents growing up.

I got badly triggered during the Kavanaugh/Ford media debacle. My friend wanted me to talk to her about what was going on with me and I resisted for a long time.

I went to slow down and my body just went completely lifeless, my vision went blurry and was almost as if I was in a Minecraft game (weird I know)

My second car accident was in August 2017, a year and 4 months AFTER my first accident. I got t-boned on the driver side in a parking lot. I was stopped had my blinker on waiting for him to go by so I can turn left and the man who hit me didn’t have his blinker on but I saw he was turning right. Well he turned right as I barely began to turn left and he came completely in my lane t-boning me. 

Then my last most recent accident happened January 2018. I was driving my Ex’s lifted F-250 truck, it was our moving weekend and he worked out of town at the time so he was driving his commuter and I was driving the truck. Well it was raining and we were taking the back roads that lead to the main hwy. Well we were coming up the hill with a slight curve and the speed limit is 45 mph and I was going about 35 mph maybe 40 mph due to it raining and I barely put pressure on the gas during the curve and the bed of the truck starts hydroplane fishtailing.. everything starts going slow motion and the front passenger tire hits a curb and the truck flipped and rolled  5-6 times about 70ft down a steep hill that dropped off into a river. I instantly thought I was going to die in that car accident. 

With those being the accidents I’ve been in I’m absolutely 1,000% terrified to drive on highways, drive in the rain, drive long distance. When I drive on the hwy I constantly feel as if I’m hydroplane fishtailing. I start to lose my breathing, my body goes numb. I absolutely REFUSE to drive in the rain unless I’m in my hometown and not on the 2 main highways. I hate driving long distance because I get a really bad rush of anxiety and feel like something bad is going to happen if I’m driving. 

Sorry for the long post. I’ve tried all the grounding techniques, having lavender scented air fresheners/ essential oil in my car, talking to myself and telling myself I’m okay.

Sorry this is a long one, but I promise there is a point. 

So, I grew up with a sister who psychologically abused me...and physically. She would hit me for breathing too loud, monitoring everything I did, she joined my bullies at school, she told me everyday I was shit, pathetic and nothing. She ground me down, and every time I see her, I feel total rage and want to scream. I have only been actively triggered by her a few times, and the rest of the time I just get this blind anger and rage when I see something I know she likes (animated Disney movies, Halloween, certain candy brands, etc).

I got sexually assaulted and would relive it in my dreams. I could never see his face, and I still can’t remember it, but I remember his hands. Regularly relived this for about 3 years after it happened, then it stopped. This wasn’t a rape. It was all hands. I always thought it was mild but the effect it has on me for years after Wasn’t mild. 

I came out as trans (unrelated to anything else, but being a closeted trans kid wasn’t fun in itself) and I lost friends. A lot of bad stuff went down, fed into stuff from my sister...I don’t want to go into detail, but the world became terrifying and far more dangerous over night, and I lost so many people I loved and I blamed myself for it. I still relive this stuff today.

 I tried to kill myself, mostly due to my life falling apart, anxiety and not being able to deal with whatever this is, whether it is ptsd or something else. I messed it up, thought about what my parents would think, and went for help at my local ER. They took me and locked me on a ward and wouldn’t let me leave. I still can’t go into hospitals and I have attacks whIch feel just like I did when they took me in. I can get set off now by seeing people being imprisoned on tv.

I guess what I’m asking is, are these things and my responses to them typical of ptsd? I know I should be asking a doctor but honestly, I can’t do it. I would rather die than go back to a hospital. I know that is silly but I just can’t.

I was in therapy for a year after I got out of hospital (thankfully, in an office that looked nothing like a hospital) and they never gave me a diagnosis more than “severe anxiety &amp; depression.” I suspected I had some kind of ptsd but assumed that it would have come up. Also...I’m not a war vet and my symptoms have been fairly mild compared to some of the stories on here. But then...a couple of friends of mine with ptsd told me I should think about it.

Basically, are my experiences typical of ptsd and should I push through and put myself back in the healthcare system to work this out?

I remember vaguely one time when i raised my hand in elementary school and was like “my daddy cusses alot” or something like that and i thought it was funny as i was only in 2nd grade or something. I feel like I completely blocked out my childhood which my therapist said is a sign of ptsd along with other symptoms i will describe later. As i was saying i blocked out alot of my childhood, i remember when i first started going to therapy when i was 13ish they would ask why i thought my childhood was toxic and what happened and I couldn’t ever describe it in detail, this has happened multiple times between switching psychs and therapists and what i think is one of the main reasons a possible diagnosis was delayed for so long. I also have gotten panic attacks since around the same age (13) and currently have a diagnosis of panic disorder which i think will eventually be changed to ptsd. One of the main things that have effected me due to this was my horrible fear of any type of confrontation no matter how big or small even if it doesn’t involve me, like for example say two people i know get into a small fight and you can feel the tension that could possibly cause me to cry or even have a panic attack. Or if it’s a example that directly effects me like someone raising their voice at me, i will always cry without a doubt which has completely disrupted me having a job. This has also caused me to not be able to defend myself at all and i tend to get walked over ALOT and causes me to get in tons of toxic relationships amongst friendships and relationships. I was also sexually assaulted at 16 by a crush at the time and I don’t feel comfortable going into detail with this part but with the toxic childhood I completely blocked it out so I don’t get flashbacks with that trauma. But i know for sure i get flashbacks from the sexual assault I experienced as well as my mom often shaming me for the clothes i wear. I scream in sleep (night terrors) often as well and i know that can be related but i don’t remember the night terrors but often wake up dissociated for a few minutes after having one. Thank you and i hope no one got triggered by this"	[]	[{'start': 251, 'end': 266, 'span': 'breaking glass ', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

It was obviously a traumatic experience and I've had a difficult time getting things back to normal. 

My wife in particular took it very hard as I messaged her on the way saying I was responding to a shooting.  She now suffers from anxiety anytime we go any place in public. 

My extended family and friends tend to minimize what happened since I wasn't shot etc. I suppose maybe it's a typical way to deal in America since this shit happens all the time. 

Any advice for my wife? I more or less am ""ok"" since I've been dealing with situations like this (not this bad) for over 14 years professionally so I can keep a lid on my issues.

So, I was diagnosed with C-PTSD this past December as well as AvPD. I had already been in a long term battle with depression and anxiety, so I wasn't too surprised to have this thrown into the mix. A little backstory on me: I came from an abusive household and was put in foster care at 12, but aged out of the system as an unwanted kid. I've been abused in almost every way you can imagine by parents, foster parents, siblings, significant others, and peers.

My biggest issue right now is my physical symptoms. I thought I was handling everything well, but it's been brought to my attention that I'm not. I'm 24 and the longest I've held a job is 7 months. I work hard, but the stress of the job always eats away at me... physically. I get sick. VERY SICK. It all starts with headaches, then my body gets heavy, I catch fever and cough, headaches become migraines, then I'm throwing up and unable to move. It lasts for weeks, sonetimes months. My brain will be foggy. I'll forget what I'm saying as I say it. I forget important things. I forget to eat.

Even as I write this now, I'm sick. I've been ""sick"" for over a month. I've never noticed the pattern before and now I'm feeling hopeless about the rest of my life. I'm in fine shape physically... But i don't understand how my anxiety and stress can have so much control over my health like it is.

666235184d066a268d7143c5	916_ptsd	"Is this PTSD? What do I do? (19 y/o male) About 2 months ago one night  I was delivering a pizza to an apartment building for my job. I left my car door unlocked for convenience when i just walked like 30 steps to the door to deliver it. A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. 
Since then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could’ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I’ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could’ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I’ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don’t really have nightmares.
I just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it’s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I’ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don’t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I’ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I’ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I’m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I’ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I’m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn’t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn’t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don’t want him to think I’m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he’s made it clear before that he doesn’t generally prescribe benzodiazepines. What are my options? I desperately need advice. Sorry for the long and badly structured rant by the way."

Normal call we get, women thought her BF locked as he left for a smoke, so as i unlocked it he had hung himself. So i was taken aback took him down checked for breathing or a pulse nothing. Yell over my radio for front desk to call 911 and then began chest compressions. Did this for about 10 minutes till paramedic arrived, then went on for about 15 minutes before calling it. 

At first on that day it didnt feel real, i was kind of in a trance but after trying to sleep all i could see was that scene playing over and over. But after ignoring it at home i felt ok, so today i came into work. But just getting on the bus to come in made me feel stressed, restless, sick.

I'm new here. I've been suffering from PTSD since 1976. Some days are good, but most really suck. Without going into detail I'll just say my PTSD is combat related, although we were not in a ""declared"" war at the time. Not Vietnam, BTW. It took the VA and social security until 2014 to finally recognize my problems.
I suffer nightmares almost every night and only get about 4 hours of sleep. 
Writing fiction has become a release for me. 
My current wife, my first wife passed away, is supportive, but doesn't really understand why I have so many bad days. She doesn't understand why we sit in the back of a restaurant and I always have to face the door. 
She doesn't like when I drink but she knows it keeps the monsters (memories) at bay - flashbacks are less frequent when I've had a few adult beverages. 
She also doesn't understand the mood swings and the anger that sometimes wells up. I try to warn her that this is not a good time for a discussion and it pisses her off. There are no support systems for families where I live - the Philippines  - so she just puts puts up with my bs.  
Damn, I'm rambling now. 
Anyway, I look forward to reading posts here about how people cope with their monsters. 
Sorry for the rambling, but it's been one of the bad days. 
BTW, I never physically abuse my wife but I can get loud sometimes and I know that can be just as bad. She loves me and puts up with my shit. 
I sold all my weapons but there are days when I wish I hadn't.

5702c03e68c641000e0d754d	1074_ptsd	"Another terrible anniversary. Woke up crying. I'm ashamed and I hate myself. (Sexual abuse and violence) I missed the primary elections two years ago because two years ago yesterday, my ex dislocated my arm in three places in the wee hours of the morning and threw my car/house keys into his lawn in the dark and rain. I was still trying to get it back together because I couldn't explain it at the ER and I didn't want insurance make me have to face him in court. I should have seen it coming. Three months before that, he screamed in my face and grabbed me by the shoulders. I ignored the blazing red flags. I still experience daily pain. Roughly twelve hours before that he'd shoved me over the couch (I have a serious back injury which I finally had my spine fused for recently, and that has long been a huge no no for me) and yanked my pants down to try to fuck me while his 4 y.o. daughter was in the bathroom. He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly. I was shocked because he hadn't done anything like that in the 11.5 months we'd been together, but as a testament to my prior experiences with abuse, I saw it as nothing terribly abnormal. This was what I'd always known relationships to be, whether it be family, friends, or intimate relationships.

I was supposed to move in with them in a couple weeks. I wanted to wait until a year in, because I knew deep down he was a bad guy, but I wanted to be wrong. I wanted to be a mom (I can't have kids), and I wanted to save his daughter from the life I had growing up. He used this all against me. He's a narcissist and has some severely anti-social tendencies. 

Last night I had a nightmare involving me babysitting for him and his ex-wife, and their friends drugging me to rape me when they brought the party home. It brought back all the bad and my husband (we met two years ago next month) has super-hearing abilities and heard me crying while he was in the bathroom getting ready for work. He came out to hold me. Now he's gone and I'm crying again, damn it. It brought back all the memories of all the physical and sexual assaults and rapes I've experienced. People like that can smell a victim a mile away. 

The shame is so overwhelming right now. That I let it happen. My entire life. From the first time I didn't say anything aged six. I just want to forget. I don't want to feel these people touching me. So many people, so many times, I've literally lost count. The things I've let happen because I never understood that people who love you don't hurt you like that. Things I let happen because I was conditioned to believe from such a young age that that is what life is. Hiding, hurting, and being used. Because I never saw the value in myself as a person. I still don't. I'm a garbage person. 

My husband was the first to tell me that it wasn't normal to let myself be an object. A fuck toy and a punching bag. I had just accepted my fate that it was my place to be used and abused. That my normal was to live in fear of being hurt or fucked. I was 34 when we met. Now, after all the years of being used like a Kleenex, I feel so dirty, ashamed, and undeserving of someone as wonderful as he is. I feel like if he truly knew all that had happened, all the things I let happen, though I've shared a lot with him, that he would be disgusted. He's a better person than that, I know. But I feel unworthy of love, and unworthy of the safety I have with him now. This morning I told him I often wonder if I'd met him sooner, if I'd believe him or just brush him off as some bullshit fairytale who would eventually hurt me in the same ways. It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that.

I'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all. A couple months ago I asked my psychiatrist if ECT would make me forget. Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. 

Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.

( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right¿ but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone ""stops breathing"" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn .."

Backstory: I moved to a new state and started a new job a little over 2 years ago, and while I get along with people fine, I don't make friends easily because of my trust issues. Still I managed to make good friends with one of my coworkers. For almost a year, we hung out almost everyday and did pretty much everything together (including vacations) and were very close. She even brought me with her when she took a new job.

I got badly triggered during the Kavanaugh/Ford media debacle. My friend wanted me to talk to her about what was going on with me and I resisted for a long time. (I lost my last best friend 10 years ago after telling her about my rape, so I generally keep shit to myself now.) Eventually I opened up and told her. Her reaction sucked, but she has lived a pretty privileged and trauma-free life so I didn't expect her to get it. And then we stopped hanging out. Suddenly she was always busy, and found other people to spend all her time with. She was my only friend in this whole state, so it sucks a lot. Worse, we share an office and many job responsibilities. So we still have to communicate and I have to pretend like it doesn't hurt.

Lately I've started getting really panicky about simply talking to her. Like heart rate &gt;100bpm panicky. My blood pressure at work this morning was 139/108. Its getting worse. I can't quit this job or I'll lose my insurance and have to take a pay cut that I can't afford. I can't keep going like this. What do I do?? Please help!"

I started to experience my first symptoms a few months after I moved into my own place in 2017 and was diagnosed with PTSD. As my life has gotten better, more stable and safer I have seen my symptoms actually becoming worse. I experience depersonalization almost daily, recently I've even started to have increasingly upsetting thoughts. I'll begin more extensive treatment next week but I guess I'm just wondering if this is normal to experience these symptoms once you are safe and if there has been any studies into why this happens.

5b77f74716aa4400016913e6	1504_ptsd	"Telling about the abuse Warning, possible triggers!

When I was 12, I was groomed and molested by my Grandfather. Admittedly this is really hard for me to write down as I've yet to really accept and work through what has happened. Even if it's been 6 years. 

2 months ago I was watching a Video about psychology (as I do almost everyday) and the topic was about the Sexual abuse that can occur with children without them realising that what's happening is wrong and scarring. That hit the nail in the coffin and the realisation hit me like a train. I wanted to throw up, curl in a ball and scream, and cry.... After 2 months of torture on my part I finally told my mum. While this happened my grandfather(abuser) frequently visits and calls almost everyday. I get panic attacks everytime it's brought up or if I'm reminded of it in some way... The guilt and shame is killing me. So it's really hard for me to express and talk about my feeling about my... Situation

I can't take it anymore. I can't stand to even think about that pedophile let alone be in the same room as him. So I've cut off ties, not answering the phone or hiding etc. My grandmother started meddling (It's typical behaviour for that part of the family) and won't stop asking questions no matter how much I tell her to leave it. So she started asking my dad questions and he doesn't take well to them. 

So this brings me to my current dilemma. I don't know if I should tell my father and/or How I should tell him. I'm stuck in a corner and this could destroy my family. I don't even know if they'll believe me or not! My family sort of despise me because I'm Granddaddy's favourite (ain't that ironic?) 

Mum really helps a lot but she's not always there to help me out of the situations. So I'm turning to you for advice, Reddit. 

Please, any advice on this would be greatly appreciate. I know this might not be the best subreddit to ask this but.... You're my only hope now."	[]	[{'start': 70, 'end': 114, 'span': 'I was groomed and molested by my Grandfather', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
5b77f74716aa4400016913e6	2421_ptsd	"What if my hurt and issues (disorganised attachment) stem from an innaccurate perception of my memories about my parents? so uuuuuuuh yeah this post carries a content warning for parental abuse, chiefly physical, I think?

I'm 27, a trans woman, pre-anything, and I'm in therapy. I initially started going because I felt like I generally needed support with being almost entirely closeted outside of the net and needing help with getting the support of my parents. The more I stayed on the more the subject became 'me' overall, and over the year or so I've been in therapy now it's the most productive it's been, rather than just doing tunnel vision on a specific problem. She's on leave right now.

I ended up describing some difficulties I was having with relationships and even just general socialising and it lead to us doing the adult attachment interview. In the course of that, I was describing stuff with my parents. I described some particular incidents where I remembered being pushed against a hard plastic prop in a theme park when I was a kid, another when my mother screamed at me and threw my own shoes at me, and another where I remembered her grabbing me, spinning me around and shoving me onto a curb before storming away. In each of these instances, I had been annoying them prior in some fashion, or misbehaving. There's probably a few others, but those stood out.

I told my therapist about how I would remember these events, rather vividly, every few weeks or so and that the more I talked about my parents over the sessions - which took some effort, as I would avoid the subject earlier on - the more frequently I thought about them. And apparently that, uh...apparently that's not normal? Prior, I had just assumed it was normal to keep remembering stuff like that. We got to the end of the interview, over the course of 3 sessions because I kept crying during it. High on anxiety, high on avoidance. Congratulations. It's a Fearful-Avoidant.

We continued talking about these things, still do. It was the first time someone referred to what I went through as incidences of abuse. I would always just say to myself, before this, that I couldn't have been abused because my parents cared about me, or it didn't count as abuse because it was inconsistent, because I was never routinely or ritualistically beaten, or that it didn't count because I deserved it.

A few weeks ago, my mother accused me of disrespecting her after not responding to some asinine suggestion. I ended up being made to sit in front of my parents and made to tell them why I will talk about things to a therapist without telling them. So I was upfront about it - 'you have a history of treating me with anger and violence'.

I was immediately met with incredulity. I was made to outline the events. I named them. One of them - the shoes - she said she didn't remember.  Two others - spinning me around and put to the curb, and being shoved against a prop at Legoland - she says I was misremembering. The former, she just pushed me away because I was being (her words) 'such a horrid thing', the latter, she says I fell and they were helping me up (I have cerebral palsy, balance issues - results in overprotective helicopter parents, to boot). Now, I'm not going to say she was wrong. These were years ago. More than a decade. Nearly two decades in one instance. And every time you remember something, you make an imperfect photocopy of it. My perception, built up over the years as I somehow drifted further and further from my parents, may not be perfect.

She then went on to ask me if I remembered one time that she definitely did hit me - I said I didn't. She explains an instance where she slapped me, because I was misbehaving, and she was mortified afterwards. 'See, you're remembering it wrong, it's all made up.' I felt like we were approaching something, because at least here she was admitting, of her own accord, to some wrongdoing.

Then, she said 'It was probably even just the shock of it then, I didn't hurt you.' My face fell. She admits to actually hitting me once, then justifies it with simultaneous 'you deserved it' and 'it wasn't even a real hit'.

That's the thing that kept me grounded. That wasn't okay. It wasn't okay to justify it. It wasn't okay to effectively corner me and make me spill the beans over what's going on in therapy because I'm seen as property. But still, the doubt remains - what if I'm wrong about this stuff that happened to me? What if I'm remembering it a certain, innaccurate way, and it's colouring my perception of everything else?

Even if my memories are wrong, though, the effects are there. I struggle with relationships. In bad days I dread getting up and seeing my parents. I feel anxious at mealtimes when I have to be near them. I am very apprehensive about the notion of going on vacation with them. I had trouble talking about them in therapy and when my therapist suggested a roleplay for tackling a subject, I just locked up and couldn't do it. That shit just doesn't come from nowhere, right? And if you want to look at fearful-avoidance as springing from your primary caregivers simultaneously giving you a lot of love and a lot of pain, well that day, where I'm being held and told that they'll 'support me' as a trans person while justifying and denying shit that my mother did to did to me, all from effectively forcing me to answer questions (understand, 'leave the room' is not something that presents itself as an option in my mental landscape) and prioritise my mother's pain over 'being disrespected' above all else, *that's* a big fucking dose of that.

Sorry for the long post. It's just all so fucked."	[]	[{'start': 179, 'end': 211, 'span': 'parental abuse, chiefly physical', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

5b77f74716aa4400016913e6	1160_ptsd	"2003 It happened in the fall of 2003. I was getting off the bus and a boy that lived in my neighborhood was walking to his house. I ran up and tackled him, as we have done many other days before. We would always wrestle, have snowball fights, goof off. Today was different. 

When he got up he grab my arms and I grabbed his back ready to wrestle. Thats when I felt something hit my in the ear hard and my leg buckled. I was then throw to the sidewalk and he laid on top of me and kept hitting me with his right fist into my left cheek. I remember trying to get up and saying ""Let me get up"" but kept getting punched in the side of my face. Then the back of my head was slammed into the concrete. I was then let up. I didn't know what to do. It was me, him and one ""friend"" just watching. He looked again, smiled, and came towards me. Again, I was thrown to the ground, hit in the side of the face multiple times, and had the back of my head slammed into the concrete. 

I walked home to find a knife, any weapon, but couldn't find anything but a brick in my front yard. I walked back to scare him to try and get him to back down. I didn't ever want to hurt anyone. I dropped the brick and again I was thrown to the ground, punched repeatedly and had my head slammed. It must have been 3,4,5 times. 

I walked home with that ""friend"" and immediately cried and broke down. This day has replayed in my head freqently ever since it happened. I turned to drugs at 14. Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything. Plotted suicide. 

Its been 15 years and it has been replaying in my head ever since. I have difficultly making friends. I stay home most weekends. I feel i will never amount to anything. On the outside I look successful. I work at a great company, I go to night class to further my career, I was a successful amateur boxer, I have a great family and girlfriend. But I cannot shake this event. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living. 

I started going to therapy consistently in 2016. I have done talk therapy, cbt, EMDR, energy healing,... I am lost. I hope I can get through this but there are times I feel I will never be confident. I still binge drink and still go through depressive spells. I wonder how my life would be if this didn't happen. It has been 15 years. 

If you have taken the time to read this I really appreciate it. I know time is very valuable and this is a rambled wall of text.

5b77f74716aa4400016913e6	109_ptsd	"I think i cured my violent sexual trauma and ""fetish"" by getting it to happen to me again. Is this possible? Is it sick? Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it ""rape"" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.


 At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).


I hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be ""real raped, choked"" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.


2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming ""OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP"" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.


Over the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???


TL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick ""fetish"". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."	[]	[{'start': 149, 'end': 164, 'span': 'sexually abused', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

At least that’s how it felt to me. My parents had me when they were very young. My dad was a drug dealer and my mom was fifteen. I was a premature baby and since my parents were kids, my grandmother (my moms mother) was practically raising me a lot of the time. But my parents resented me for something they allowed to happen. They tried to make it so I couldn’t see her but when they wanted to go out well they would stop saying that. I would always get caught in the middle of their fights, glasses getting thrown, some even hit me, getting knocked over, getting screamed at for being in the room when they were fighting. And then it got worse. Whenever I tried to Hug my parents they’d either tell me to go away or they’d ask me what I wanted and push me out of the way. They’d tell me they never wanted me. They got older and when I was seven had another kid. And overtime three more. My parents stopped with the non legal stuff but they still constantly had their issues with each other, and whenever they didn’t get along they would take it out on me. I was grounded for months at a time for no reason, everything taken out of my room. Sometimes even locked in. And I was a pretty good child. I was just really sad. Just wanted a family. In middle school I tried really hard to get away. I went to the police and showed them the bruises told them of the horror I was living, but since I was in an upper class family they said I had it good and I should be grateful. I’m transgender which is another reason they just really didn’t like me. One time when I went to the police my mom threw herself into a cabinet and said I threw her, and I ended up having to go through the legal system as a very naive autistic innocent kid who wouldn’t hurt a fly. I was constantly just told I wasn’t wanted, pushed, hit, and when I ran away on my 18th birthday they made me feel like a monster for leaving. And the rest of my family says that it wasn’t abuse. That I had a good childhood. But I remember laying in my bed begging to either die or get another family.

Her other friend's dad was there watching out for her. She was with the two most responsible 21 year olds I know, her best friend &amp; her protective boyfriend, who I love like my own. She was less than a minute from our house! My nervous mommy-heart tried to rest assured, she was safe. And, she was.
But. A 20 year old kid, not a local, was here for labor day. He was staying in a summer cottage by the lake. There are 2 bars on my road. He, with the big holiday crowd, managed to slip into the bars, looking for a girl. He came up to the kids' table, chatted and asked if they'd seen her. He left on foot. Mag and her friends left the bar after 3. That kid was dead within the hour, found unresponsive on the road near the last bar. They had JUST talked to him!! It was initially believed he was the victim of a drunken driver, hit and run. But now, there are more questions. Cause of death is pending autopsy. The kids are devastated. My town is upside down. Her friend worked there that night in the kitchen &amp; joined them after. She worked last night as well, came here in tears, just heart torn. My babies are hurting and I can't bear it! And the world feels that much more dangerous. So difficult to ever feel the same. She was safe..
And..where one of my best friends lives, a 2 year old was hit by a car and killed. This on the tail of a 10 year old murdered, strangled by her stepmother, all this weekend in the same area.
I'm shook. Anxiety is BEYOND. All these young ppl lost in the space of days, it's stomping my heart. In times like these, dark dark days, how the hell do we have Faith in this sometimes ugly, evil world again?!😔💔"	[]	[{'start': 1282, 'end': 1321, 'span': 'victim of a drunken driver, hit and run', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
5b77f74716aa4400016913e6	2193_ptsd	"Was in a traumatic car accident last week I don't know what I'm trying to gain from posting this, I think I just need to talk about it. Maybe hear similar stories. I've been trying to not talk about it too much to my friends and family because it was traumatic for them, too, and I'm sure they're sick of hearing about it. I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I know it's gonna be long. I apologize in advance. 
I was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically. 
My mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us. He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake. I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react. 
His mini van hits us right on my door. I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state. 
It happened exactly like it does in the movies. In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself. I expected the car to just stop. I keep replaying that moment in my head. Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window. The window shatters on me, the airbag goes off, my door caves in on me. Everything goes red then a pale orange. 
Our car spins what feels like a million times and when we stop everything smells like smoke. I hear screaming and it takes me a while to realize it's me screaming. My mom gets out before I even realize we've stopped moving. I can't get out, my door is caved in. I feel like the car is going to explode and I can't do anything. I'm sure that I'm going to be set on fire. My whole face feels wet and I notice blood dripping onto my jacket. I can't open my right eye. Maybe I was just too scared. I don't know. My mom pulls me out of the car from the drivers side. 
From the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming. One woman, who I later learned had medical training of some sort, got a clean towel from her house and put it over my eye. Her daughter was on the phone with 911. She was trying to help me breathe but I was hysterical. I ask if everyone in the other car is okay. She says they're all okay, I'm the only one bleeding. 
At the hospital, they take two pieces of glass out of my eye, right below my eyebrow. By some miracle, all I have is a concussion, the stitches from the glass above my eye, lots of bruising and some cuts from the glass. I'm gonna be out of work for 1-2 weeks. The general consensus is that I'm very lucky I didn't die. I have lost about 6 of my old classmates to car accidents alone this year. 
On one hand, I do feel lucky. I should've been in worse shape. On the other hand, to be honest, most days I wake up, I wished it killed me. I feel like I'm trapped in my own life now. Being in cars now is suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box underwater. Loud noises, the smell of smoke, seeing headlights, walking too close to the road, the sound of car horns. Fireworks. Doors closing too hard. Everything scares me. The drives to my doctors appointments are excruciating. I think about what it might've been like if I just died. 
I feel completely out of control of everything. I obsess over everything I can't control now. Natural disasters, house fires, accidents of any kind. I don't want anyone to leave my sight because if I can't see them in front of me, then I don't know they're safe. It feels so unfair this guy just got to rip away my peace of mind. I've become so preoccupied with control. What I can control, what I can't control, what others around me can control. 
I have PTSD already, from childhood abuse and a sexual assault that happened two years ago. I also have OCD which is probably responsible for my new obsessive thoughts. 
Maybe it's dramatic. My injuries are minor compared to what could've happened. But I feel completely broken. I want to stay positive but I'm really struggling with the idea of this being my reality forever. This has destroyed me in a way I could never describe to someone who hadn't felt it."

65a6a462a2f1c01d86077b8c	224_ptsd	I spent my life terrified of my own shadow...and no one but myself knew why I was sexually abused for years as a young girl, ages 8-10. My entire life I was literally scared of everything. Every guy that passed me on the street (still dealing with this one). Stair wells, parking garages, elevators, being alone, being with people, family, friends, friends of friends, the dark, I could literally go on and on! I spent every second of everyday scared, all because someone decided to hurt me as a child. PTSD never crossed my mind. I thought that was something only service members got diagnosed with. I never told anyone of my abuse until I was in my 20s, but even then I didn’t deal with it. I didn’t date until I was out of high school because I was so uncomfortable around men. If I ever met someone that didn’t scare me, I KNEW they must have been a good person, because that NEVER happened! It wasn’t until I turned 30 that I went to a therapist and started to deal with what happened to me. I am finally living a somewhat normal life. I still have many fears, but I don’t spend everyday terrified of life and things that COULD happen. For that I am very thankful!

65a6a462a2f1c01d86077b8c	472_ptsd	"Is it possible to heal PTSD? A little bit about myself first... at the age of 16 i almost died in a car accident by myself, at 25 i got hit by a family van at 45km/hr on the street. and at the age of 27 i got in another car accident at 70km/hr.   
So yes I've got some serious trauma and all my life i asked myself one question. how can i be happy in my whole being naturally like a baby does? 

  
and I've went through an amazing journey to discover really deep fundamental of life. I've always been a positive and resilient guy and that helped me a lot in my life.

  
but i wanted to create my dreams and one of dreams was to be happy again in my body. i knew that for that to happen i had to find a way to heal these past trauma.

  
My goal was, how can i be able to think and relieve a trauma and be free from the emotional baggage of it because i knew that your life is the reflection of what's inside of you.

  
So here's the step by steps way to do this. warning! trauma can take a while to heal but if you stay consistent with this you will see a really big difference over time and it can be rough to go through this but it is worth it.

  
so the first step is to think about the trauma and then really focus on your whole being (emotions, mental, physical and energical patterns) when you think about the trauma.

  
feel the feelings related to the trauma scale them from 1 to 10, 10 meaning it's the worst feeling ever.now take your two hands in front of you and do this. imagine all these feelings, these beliefs etc... imagine them going into your hands and push them into the universe take a breath wait couple of seconds. 

  
**it doesn't matter if you don't believe it will work. DO IT! for the sake of your happiness!!!**

  
then refocus on the trauma and see how you feel NOW thinking about the same trauma. 

  
scale on 1-10 again (sometimes you can feel the emotions spiking up it is alright just continue this process.)

  
see how you feel thinking about it and do it again

  
so see the trauma, see how it makes your body react, scale it, put it into your hands, send it to universe, take couple of breath. verify how you feel again.  
RINSE and repeat.

  
Did it work for you? if not comment below i'll help you.

Anyway today I was playing on my PlayStation and I could feel him, I could feel everything he did to me, this doesn't really happen to me, the last time it happened was last year and it was because my SO was doing the same thing that monster had to me and I cried, my SO was scared and stopped straight away, luckily a massive spider ran across my leg so I didn't really have time to explain. 

But today I was just playing a game and I freaked out, I was on my own and I just cried and right now I'm really fucking drunk and to scared to think about today 

I don't know if I want advice or just to sound off

In December, I decided to spontaneously cease contact with my dad when an opportunity arose. I had been ruminating over that thought for years. I thought I would be free of his emotional abuse, the feeling of being suffocated and having to answer to him. To my surprise, it got really bad. I began to dwell more on the past, and my mom was continuously making me feel guilty, claiming to not understand what could’ve possibly went wrong. This was exhausting to go through. I developed a severe marijuana addiction as a result of being unable to cope with those emotions. I was seeing a psychiatrist but they were ignorant to trauma. 

Last year, I witnessed the van attack in Toronto and it’s aftermath as I walked past Yonge street that day after work, bodies still laid down at 9 pm as the investigation wasn’t complete. This shook my sense of safety as well. I didn’t realize until my first appointment last week with a trauma specialist that it deeply disturbed me and made me incredibly uncomfortable in public. 

I’m almost done, I swear. 

Now I’m realizing how my mom was potentially worse than my dad in some regards. Some of the things she said to me when I decided to cut contact are now things that have made me want to stop contact with her. “I chose you my whole life over him and I suffered for it.” Not really something I wanted to hear, something she likely thinks I’ve forgotten. The more I think back, the more disturbed I get. I feel shackled to this fucked up family situation. The reason I haven’t gone entirely nuclear on my mom is because my younger sibling is still at home and it’s already been a difficult time since I ceased contact with my dad. My moms not making the house a very pleasant place (I moved out a while ago)

If you’ve read this far, I appreciate you so much. Present day, I feel like my chest is full of dread and I feel so heavy. My personal hygiene is a joke, and I’m riddled with intrusive thoughts about harming myself that I can’t listen to because my partner will notice. I feel like I’ve been robbed of a shot at life and I’m so angry for it. I feel like I can’t breathe. I’ve asked to see the therapist on a weekly basis because I’ve never felt so bad. I thought in my twenties I was making progress on my mental health and this all creeped up on me out of nowhere. I was well aware of my situation but it never felt so... life altering. I’m more and more aware of how I’ve been robbed of a childhood, robbed of a sense of safety, robbed from a life free of anxiety and depression. I’m so bitter and angry and I just want to scream. This past week has been a literal hell for me and I don’t know how to get by until my appointment. 

I’m not a danger to myself I just don’t know how to cope. I’ve done so many therapies, I have all the tools. It just all feels meaningless when my situation will never really change. I hate my life."

I’ve been in therapy for a little over a month now and was finally told that I have PTSD from the sexual abuse I dealt with when I was a child. No one in my family knows about what I’ve been through—my mom is actually still married to the man who abused me. I have told my current boyfriend about it as well as a few friends over the years but it has always been a secret. 

I perseverate on it daily and it has had an effect on every aspect of my life. I’m happy I’m making progress in addressing it in therapy and working on healing.

However, I want to tell my brother and maybe my sister about it more than anything. My brother (27M) lives on his own and is fairly independent. However, like everyone else in my life, loves and respects my abuser (he is extremely charismatic). My sister (21F) is my abuser’s daughter (we share the same mom though) and I often wonder if she was subjected to the same abuse I went through. She deals with anxiety but seems to have a good relationship with him so I’m really unsure. She also still lives at home so I don’t want to put her in danger either. 

Does anyone have experience telling people like their siblings about their abuse? It has been over 15 years since it happened but it haunts me every day.

I came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. 

About a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. 

Lots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. 

The day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. 

I woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear ""COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said ""one sec"" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. 

During this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. 

The main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.

I explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. 

After the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. 

I showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. 

Since I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. 

It got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. 

Do I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. 

I miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. 

anything will help.

I mean 0-60 in a flash. I’ve been working with my therapist and working towards EMDR but I guess I need some sort of imaginary box to lock up and store the bad shit. My therapist said that I need to imagine a safe place to store this stuff where I can recall it and safely place it back in the “box” when I’m done with working on it in EMDR. my problem is that this imaginary box is hard for because visualizing this and working it the way she wants me to work with it doesn’t seem to work. Do any of you have experience with this and can give me advice....or even know what the eff I’m even talking about.....

now that I am out of their lives, i am starting to process what happened. what really happened. like, the reality is hitting me. i am seeing all the little ways these experiences make me dysfunctional on a day to day basis, and all the big ones tools. and i don’t know how to start talking about this. any of it. the childhood sexual abuse, the physical abuse, the emotional abuse, the sexual assault, the narcissism. i don’t know how to begin to explain how these things effect me or make me feel because I don’t understand it. I just have little moments where I realise “i probably did that or do that because of x” and then get mad because x made me do that.

im just extremely overwhelmed. i didn’t even tell him I had a history of sexual trauma in the intake, just physical abuse, so he doesn’t even know that. he’s prodded me some about the abuse but it’s so hard to find words to explain and I also kind of shut down. like my brain just stops moving and I get stupid. it’s extremely frustrating.

641399039dac0535d22e05a6	1334_ptsd	"[NFSW] [Vent] [Trigger Warning] Feel like I won't recover It's difficult to believe if you look at me normally, or the way I talk about my family. I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.

I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.

I just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? 

A few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.

I feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. 

I think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future. I just want to be ok. :( "	[]	"[{'start': 362, 'end': 728, 'span': ""I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit.

It continued to get worse and worse, starting from disciplining for no reason and then at the time they divorced it it got to hitting with a closed fist every night. Then, 4 more years passed and my mom finally got full, but he had visitation every other weekend. As you can probably guess, it got worse. I was 16 when he finally tried to kill me by abandoning me up in upstate New York on a mountain with no food or water on a 12 hour hike (normally 12 hours). I got lost and too a long trail around and was out on my own for 36 more hours before I finally made it to the trail head and called the police. It took me so long because I had to free climb, I had to swim, and I had to drink from a river. That resulted in a very nasty virus that emptied my guts. The worst part of it though, was when he came to pick me up. He yelled at me and nearly decked me. He would have if it hadn't been for the officers there.

Its been 4 years now and I still remember every little thing about that incident. I think back to see if I did anything to deserve all of that but I cant remember anything. Recently though I have found the love of my life and they are helping a lot. Should I tell them

I haven’t enjoyed this day for years. A lot of bad things have happened on this day of the year from my mom beating me to threatening hospitalization to needing to run away to getting dumped mental breakdowns. To the point that every year I dread my birthday. Today I’m 19

School has been over for some weeks so I’m spending today as I have every day sitting around the house doing absolutely nothing except crying a little more and being more depressed. And that makes me sad. The day is over soon and I can’t enjoy it

My parents tell me all year I’m a bad kid and don’t deserve anything and they buy things for me then use them against me to guilt trip me. Whenever they’ve bought me huge gifts on my birthday I’ve had a panic attack and then they get angry with me for not wanting to accept them. 

I get depressed and feel guilt when people express excitement. I get depressed and guilty when people buy me gifts, or praise or compliment me, or ask what I want so I tell them I want nothing. 

But I do want to enjoy it. I just can’t make myself. I do want gifts and to feel appreciated but the guilt overwhelms me. I get so upset when people compliment me or do anything. So it’s just better if I’m alone. It’s just better if I get nothing. Then I mourn how the day was miserable and I can’t enjoy it and dread it for the next year. 

Like it’s a cycle I can’t break out of that I want to but I just can’t. It probably doesn’t make sense to anyone.  My friends offered to hang out with me but I’ve just been by myself.

I was diagnosed with PTSD because I grew up in a very abusive home with drug addicts and alcoholics. My family is very twisted so I avoid them at all cost but my mother recently revealed that I ""may have been"" (her words) sexually assaulted by my uncle, who molested her. I witnessed him attempt to molest her when I was younger, so I don't doubt this.

He was a very abusive to my family (we lived with him on/off till I was 15) because he was a mean drunk and would cut phone cords and start physical fights with my grandparents and my mom. I remember he used to tie me up with duct tape and cover my mouth and would keep me in his room. I don't remember if anything happened but after my experience with sleep paralysis - I'm kind of messed up and feel like I do remember now. 

I hope I am making sense because I am on high-alert right now.

I felt my mind wake up but I couldn't move my body. I felt like something was in the room and it was trying to confine/take me with blankets. I felt it actually trying to confine me. I felt its hands touching me. At first, I thought it was little gremlins, but then I thought of my uncle, and I attempted to scream for help. I kept trying to move my body but I was stuck.

It's been 4 hours since that happened and I am terrified and I feel violated and sick. I'm not sure what is going on. But I feel alone, sad, scared, and like I don't want to try anymore. I just feel so sick and confused and like an epiphany exploded in my head. 

I don't know what I am expecting but I don't have anyone to talk to who will understand.

Sorry if I ramble, I'm a bit shaken up. I was recently introduced to someone who also has PTSD. I was a bit reluctant to connect but decided to be cautiously optimistic as there aren't many ways to meet people here (besides bars) or any local PTSD peer/group resources in our area for civilians. Done all the one on one with counselors and need to connect in person with others who can relate. Knowing to be careful in any case, and not looking for dating (and making that clear to him), we met a only a few times and chatted about how to address PTSD symptoms in a healthy manner. Friendly and polite, encouraging his engagement with hobbies while having some laughs as we seemed to share the same type of humour. Just decent human stuff.

Fast forward to today. Another invitation but me declining as I'm sicker than a dog with fever and chills. Christ if I didn't suddenly get multiple messages about how he'd received bad news and was in the middle of a PTSD episode. On to how I grounded him and helped him think clearer and had hopes I'd find him attractive, etc. Then sharing how missed his army buddies who'd died and wanted to give up as life is too painful. Over and over again. I tried calling but he wouldn't pick up. Just more messages of the same nature. And more.

It's an unsettling position and my heart was going out to him. I used to have the same dark thoughts time to time. There was also more than one occasion as a kid where someone gouged their wrists open in front of me or I had to hold them down because they were trying to throw themselves in harms way.

Not knowing his family or anyone he might know, I looked up and called a vet line asking if they could help out. They instructed me contact the local RCMP. I did so, explaining the above and asking if they could just make sure he was okay.

They advised me to keep him engaged in conversation if I could while they sent someone over. Cut short our call when his doorbell rang. A few moments later, the RCMP called me back asking about his phone as it was going straight to voicemail and he had all his lights out and curtains drawn. All I could do was repeat the number. About 15 minutes later, a call back. He'd stated he was fine and downplayed his claims, citing counselors, medications, etc that he says he's accessing so they left.

In come a bunch of nasty messages. To the effect of ""if I really cared, I would have come over myself. He went on to state he'd been thrown around by members when having a bad day but he was just sad. That he has negative feelings toward them. That he'd made the mistake in trusting me and I overstepped boundaries. That civi's can't be trusted. How his last girlfriend had done the same thing to him by calling when he was just having a bad day. It was her fault the they'd roughed him up"". On and on. 

I could only tell him that I didn't have much choice. That I'm not their hugest fan the past couple years myself but he's expressing suicidal ideology, and I don't know who he has in his life he trusts. That no one was out to get him here and that I don't deserve to be punished for trying to do the decent human thing. And that I am not his girlfriend (only physical contact had been a quick hug as I left a few days ago). That if he reads his miles of texts it shows his PTSD in getting in the way of of non-professionals helping him right now and provided the local crisis line number. I wished him well and reminded him that I needed to be healthy and care of myself by blocking him. Done. Nothing nasty or confrontational. 

Thing is, some stupid part of me still wants to apologize and calm him down. I'd meant no harm at all but screwed up. I'm jumping at every little sound and feel as though I'm somehow ""in trouble"" for some misdeed. I don't think my cell block even works properly but I'm afraid to look and find out. Having been brought up being held responsible for others' unpredictable actions and fists slammed on me for not measuring up to babysitting them, it can grind a person down. After how long I'm finally starting to see that in me now? Jesus.

I was also just starting to get to the point in life of emotionally realizing that I'm not as obligated as I feel or as others have guilted me to feel. There's a tiny part in me that knows I don't deserve this dynamic, and even wants to say ""I don't owe you or anyone else anything. Get off my back"". It doesn't feel strong at the moment, but it's probably just tiredness, flu, and needing to go back to bed. What a bunch of high school crap.

But I do miss my home city. You can at least try to escape into the crowds if you need to get away. Maybe even utter a quick ""Fuck off, freak"" before running."

6658b4b44a24f8bcc46f135b	633_counseling	My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression.

6658b4b44a24f8bcc46f135b	939_ptsd	"Everything keeps hitting me all at once Let me start this by saying I have PTSD. Everything hits me a bit harder than most people so if you think this is nothing, it may be for you but for me it's hell.

Let's start with last week. I contacted Amazon over a pretty simple request. I'm on disability and didn't receive my cheque for December. I've been scraping by for that month and this by dumpster diving and panhandling. Merry Christmas to me I guess. At any rate, I contacted Amazon customer service with an off hand request. I had gotten a Prime trial and asked them if they could extend it for a month for free. I explained the situation. Didn't expect anything from it at all, but the reaction I got was weird. The person I was chatting to on their website started asking for order numbers. I said nevermind and ended the chat. 13 hours later he emails me to say he didn't understand what I was talking about and said to contact again. So I did. Weirdly, the second person was like ""No problem, done. Go enjoy The Grand Tour!"" So I tried to get on Prime and it didn't work. Figured I'd let it be for a couple days. 

While waiting, my roommate comes back. He left in November to go to India for the holidays. I forgot how much noise he made. He's on the phone at all hours of the day and night. He often puts the other person on speaker phone and will yell his responses. I can't sleep. I mean I can't afford my medication to sleep properly anyway, but this asshole is so fucking loud that I couldn't sleep if I did have the meds. I've gotten maybe 2-3 hours sleep since he returned last week. I turned the music on once at 10AM and he had the nerve to tell me to turn it down. That pissed me off even more. 

While all this is going on, I'm waiting for the government to tell me what happened to my disability cheque. They keep saying they're doing investigations and will have another sent out as soon as it's done, but that does fucking nothing for me. We don't have food stamps here so I can't go get that. Food bank is miles away and my knees are fucked, so getting there is hell to begin with and coming back takes multiple hours. Even if I did get there, I don't have a current statement from the government with my address on it because they didn't send the goddamned cheque. 

So I go back to Amazon. Prime still isn't working. So Customer Service tells me it's just a glitch and they'll reach out to me in 12 hours. They do. 12 hours later they say I never had prime to begin with. So I contact customer service AGAIN. This time I get someone who calls me darling every 3 seconds despite me asking repeatedly for her to knock it off. She says that they did give me an extension on the prime but it was an extension of nothing because the prime was already over. She then hangs up on me. So I say fuck it and tweet Amazon. They respond and ask what's wrong. I explain. At this point I don't care about the free prime. I had no right to it anyway, I always thought it was a longshot, but being told a half dozen different things is just bizarre and confusing. They then don't respond for a day. So I say ""Uh hello?"" And another amazon rep comes on twitter to ask what's wrong. I explain again. No response. Today, 4 days later, I say that it's the worst service I've received. Amazon immediately jumps on and gives me a link to contact. I do and don't even get a chance to explain. The dude just says another department will reach out to me.

Then I turn to Canada Post and ask why the hell I didn't get stuff delivered. They shrug and say ""We deliver until 8PM."" I'm checking the mail continuously. We have no mail and no one else has gotten mail in the neighborhood. We live next door to a Canada Post and have never had this problem before. Maybe it's the weather? No. People across the road got their mail. Just that we didn't. So no cheque for me today despite being told I'd get it today. That means no eating today, no meds today, no paying bills today. Sitting in the dark crying all night. 

Like I said it in't much. But this is overwhelming to all hell to me and I'm freaking the fuck out. I want to beat the shit out of my roommate because he won't shut the fuck up, I want to scream my goddamn head off at Amazon because they won't give me a straight fucking answer. I want to lose my shit at the government because they lost my cheque and i've been without any money since the start of December. 

To top it all off, a storm kicked up at 3PM and I can't go dumpster diving for any food. Tomorrow it's going to be worse and colder so I won't be able to go dumpster diving then either AND the mail likely won't show up again. 

I just fucking want this all to stop. everythnig. I can't get a breather. Meds I'm on barely work to begin with so when this shit happens I just feel lost and terrified and suicidal to all hell. I'm so... idk. overwhelmed. overloaded. Just something. "	[]	"[{'start': 234, 'end': 424, 'span': ""I contacted Amazon over a pretty simple request.

6658b4b44a24f8bcc46f135b	1867_ptsd	"Is it possible to have very minor ptsd as a result of situations caused by social anxiety? First things first, I in no way intend to be disrespectful, or undermine the experiences of anyone with this post. I am really scared to post this because I’m preempting negative or hostile responses regardless of how supportive and nice this community seems, so please be considerate if you intend to comment. Also, I probably won’t look at the comments for a long time as a way to reduce the fear I’ll feel when reading them. So keep that in mind if you’re expecting a reply from me. 

I experience social anxiety a lot. And quite severely too. Even with medication and regular therapy it still affects my daily life to a great extent. 

For those of you not familiar, social anxiety disorder could be summarised as an intense, usually irrational fear of being judged by others. Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it. Basically, it’s a very irrational fear that I’m very aware of. Regardless, I have little control over it as it is essentially instinctual, as y’all probably understand. 

Every now and then something will happen in my life that causes me great stress. A mundane event that becomes worse when combined with my SAD. Usually this is some form of criticism. The symptoms I’ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I’ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I’m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. 

For example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can’t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn’t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember. For weeks after, the topic of volleyball caused great stress to me. 

The thought of practicing or going to games caused panic attacks. When I thought of the event my core would seize up, heart rate would increase, limbs would start trembling, and sometimes my breathing would speed up or become sporadic. A bit like a mini panic attack, without all the symptoms or duration (these episodes lasted a few seconds, 10 at the most).  

I would avoid the topic of volleyball for weeks after, even stopping reading a book series that mentioned volleyball because it reminded me too much of the event. I would lose interest in volleyball, despite me actually really enjoying it. 

It’s been a few years, but thinking of this instance still causes some of these symptoms, to a lesser degree. I don’t think I’ve ever had nightmares about this specific situation, but similar events have had negative influences on my dreams in the past. 

I’ve provided examples of these symptoms in relation to /just one/ event, but keep in mind this still occurs for all of my most stressful experiences which are numerous. 

Idk. I just feel kinda bad posting this here, because there are people with legitimately debilitating symptoms from horrible experiences and I’m curious about my problems, which are comparably laughable. And I’m worried I’m doing this ‘for attention’ or to be ‘special’, which I’m not. I just can’t help worrying about how others will see this post, and whether I can even trust my own motives. Anyway, thanks for your time. I don’t have anyone else I can talk to, so this is helpful."

6658b4b44a24f8bcc46f135b	375_ptsd	"First flashback in awhile today This is my first post here. My back story is thst in 2015 I fell during a free solo rock climb in the Ozark Mountains. I fell from approximately 50 ft and was kept alive by my two best friends until I was loaded into a helicopter five hours later. I lost seven teeth, crushed the right side of my face and broke my left humerus. While it's not ideal, I've accepted this moment in my life and the results of it. In a roundabout way, it's lead to one of my best friends meeting his now-fiancee and put me on a positive direction in life as opposed to bouncing around from job to job.

Over the past couple of years I dealt with roughly one dream a week reliving the experience and waking up in a panic. For the past year I've been going to a rock climbing gym and the dreams have largely stopped. I still avoid ladders and other heights, but I'm comfortable on the rock wall. I'm not as daring as others there, and it really limits the difficulty of climbs I can complete because I don't put myself out there as much as I could to make the more difficult moves. Sometimes I fall, but it's generally expected. Or I jump off because I'm worn out. 

Today I had an unexpected fall. It was only from about 7ft, but my foot slipped, just like it did in my accident. I hit the ground awkwardly, but unhurt and didn't stop shaking for an hour. I was on the verge of tears as I left the gym and bought a pack of cigarettes (I've been on an ecig for a few months). To top it off, I had to go in for a work meeting where the manager tore into us for the general decline in standards that's occurred lately, which is a whole other story.

I don't know what to do. I'm still on edge, and I don't want to sleep because I know I'll have a dream where I fall, or I lose my teeth, or crush my face or something. I was doing so well, and I know it's just a bad day, but I'm terrified that this step back will have more of an impact. I just need someone who's been here before to tell me something that helps."

My incident was not as serious as war, somehow I wish I could say that it was. I became suicidal at 13, when I remembered an early childhood event involving a priest when I was very young. I made various attempts to die, but was thwarted In my efforts by consecutive strokes of luck. One example, when I was 17 I tried to do it by drinking a bunch of isopropyl alcohol. Your liver can't beak it down, so I figured it was a sure shot. However, I had already gotten drunk off of JD before I drank it, and that alcohol neutralized the isopropyl. So I lived. 
Anyway, around 19 I got a job working for the state cleaning up highways for peanuts. I liked the work, despite the money, because I was into conservation, and a lot of other hippie philosophy. One of my co-workers captured my heart, and in a not so subtle way I drunkenly confessed my affections at a house party I had for all my co workers. It was bad, I was blacked out by then, but that's as far as it went. I apologized the following morning, but she said not to worry about it. I was mortified regardless, and so I was equally shocked when she asked of I would get an apartment with her the following week. My living situation was deteriorating, as my roommate at the time was using roids, and getting more unstable every day. It would mean I had to commute 45 minutes instead of 5, but I wouldn't be strangled in my sleep. After we started living together, during our transitions to our apartment, things were cool. It was myself, her, her best friend and her friends boyfriend. A little cramped, but it made rent feasible. There's more details but I'll condense the rest, I can't think about it all in depth or I'm going to melt down. Any readers with a respectful curiosity can pm me if they want. I ended up being strung along, gaslit, robbed, and psychologically and emotionally tortured until I confronted her about everything. She admitted through a nasty smirk that she thought it was fun to watch me writhe silently, and that I probably deserved it. Then she surmised that because I was of no further use to her, I would be useless to anyone else. And she told me to finish the job. I broke down, and almost jammed a knife into the nearest light socket. Then I dropped the knife... I couldn't do it. I couldn't leave and hurt my family, but if I'm living for them, is it genuine? Is it really living?
That day haunts me still, and I don't have tools that work anymore. Are there any sufferers out there reading that have any tips for someone in my position? I've been having more frequent flashbacks and nightmares about her, and that whole experience. Please help.

I get how upsetting this is.If I was your therapist, I'd want to explore this a good deal, because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening. Be careful not to jump to conclusions. Sometimes people have been slowly ""falling out of love"" for a long time, and often this is due to some (perhaps unnamed) unmet need in the marriage. She may have been coming to this point over a period of time, and has only finally said so. It's also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisis...she's changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it. Only she can help herself through this (she could get the help of a therapist, but it's not your place to tell her to do this). Or, it's possible she's met this new ""friend"" and her attachment to him has clouded her view, or clarified something for her.  Right now, it's important that you respect your wife's decision to separate, if she's asking for that. We can't trap people in a marriage. If she needs separation, or distance, then it's respectful to give her that.That doesn't mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now. I would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what YOU want; whether it's to move on with your life, or wait patiently for a period of time. I can't predict what will happen here.

6658b4b44a24f8bcc46f135b	1359_ptsd	"From ok to 0 in about 2 seconds I have a bunch of traumatic things that have happened to me while I was growing up (sexual abuse from family members, a long-term emotionally abusive relationship that has thankfully ended, and continually high pressure from my family to perform and has been very verbally abusive).

Previously I’ve been able to cope extremely well and sort of swept all of this under the rug. I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life’s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.

2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I’m seeing therapists but they haven’t put down a diagnosis yet) as I’m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I’ve had to stop work for the moment because I can’t cope.

I am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner’s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.

It’s father’s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven’t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it’s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don’t resolve any issues. And it’s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn’t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it’s taken a full toll on me.

The relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn’t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father’s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad’s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn’t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I’m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I’m terrified about my future and whether I’ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I’m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn’t that good to start with. My parents don’t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).

I'm currently doing an intensive outpatient therapy program while I'm on medical leave. This is the first time in my life I've ever had therapy and it's really hard because talking about it (especially in a group setting) triggers so many painful memories and emotions that I've suppressed for 15+ years. I've been sleeping even worse than normal, which has worsened my daytime sleepiness. 

My doctor had recommended Seroquel a while back, but I refused because I read that it can cause weight gain and other problems. Well, I finally surrendered because I felt like I was going to have a psychotic episode if I didn't start getting  more sleep. 

Let me tell you, I only took 25mg last night and it mellowed me out. It was like somebody turned the volume down on the racing thoughts and anxiety about going to sleep. I was dead to the world!

Tl;dr: I experienced stuff that I'm not sure qualifies as traumatic? Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. 

Hey Everyone,   
First time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   


1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. 
2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. 
3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him ""If you're gonna hit me, do it!"" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said ""Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her"". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me ""oh I fight with my brothers too!"" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. 
4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. 
5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that ""if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault"".   


In my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole ""PTSD"" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   
Idk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this. Any comments appreciated."

The rest of the time, my nightmares are just random, horrible things my brain can think of. I don’t even know how I’m somehow thinking of these things to generate a nightmare. They’re nothing like my life, my trauma, or things I’ve seen/read during the day.

He is much better now, and I don't blame him for being ill at the time. But, I think I'm just now coming to terms with the fact that I've suffered trauma, twelve years after it happened.

so basically i was diagnosed with PTSD when i was 16 years old (i’m almost 21 now), up until now, every doctor, labeled me as ADHD and BPII (bipolar disorder two), i have come to the realization that those were misdiagnosis masked by trauma. i was physically abused as a toddler, witnessed my mother being physically and verbally abused, up until the age of 5. when i started kindergarten, my teacher was physically abusive towards me and other students, she also illegally gave me ridelin (i have no clue how to spell that), i didn’t speak about any of my abuse until i was 15 years old, and even when i started to talk about all of it, i had a rough time. growing up due to my trauma i was an aggressive child and didn’t understand a lot of my feelings. i dissociate a lot, and don’t have a definite understanding of who i am. when i was 18 i was raped by my best friend, which didn’t help anything at all. i was in behavioral therapy from 5 - 17 and until i was 15 i would go to therapy to play games then when i was asked about something i wasn’t ready to talk about i should just shut down. i relive all of my trauma, anytime i write or talk about it, and i don’t know how to let things go. i don’t know how not to relive my trauma or take things for a grain of salt either. 

so point of the post, i am trying to work through my trauma, because although it was hard for me to sleep as a child, now every time i start to go to sleep i have anxiety attack’s, which end up me pulling a 72 hour all nighter, sleeping for 16 hours then repeating that cycle. it seems like my trauma is affecting me in what i didn’t know it could, and i don’t know how to get through it. i don’t have insurance or money to get professional help. any tips? when i was younger i used to write and draw a lot, but my mom read my journals to my siblings, and now it’s really hard for me to write. i’m used to unhealthy coping mechanisms, and they seem to help more than the healthy ones, but i don’t want to continue to practice unhealthy coping mechanisms, and i really want help. another issue i seem to have is i don’t know who i am as a person, i don’t know if this has anything to do with me being dissociative, but it’s kinda scary, looking at myself and not recognizing anything. sometimes hold my own hand or stroke my arm to remind myself that i’m a person, i check my pulse to make sure i’m still alive because sometimes i don’t feel like i am. i feel numb. to everything and i really want to get better."
