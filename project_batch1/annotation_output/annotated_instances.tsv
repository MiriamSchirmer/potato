Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. 

*My dad did drugs
*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once
*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once
*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)
*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.
*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)
*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we ""misbehaved"" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.
*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. 
*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. 
*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. 
*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.
*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.
*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. 
*I was in a ""relationship"" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).
*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. 

All of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.

I want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old. I want a chance to be 5 again. But I don't want to die.

I don't know what to do.

6655277a511e217561d5a869	1748_counseling	You can't fix this by yourself, but I applaud you for trying. One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced. I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are. I wish you well.

6655277a511e217561d5a869	2209_ptsd	"Intense (triggered) fear of drugs I have no idea where to post this, and I’m even sure I have ptsd I just don’t know how to deal with this. When I was in middle school my older brother got into drugs and became a heroin addict shortly after. My mother would cry everyday and act coldly toward me and my little brother. She would go on fits of panic hyperventilating and pacing through our whole house and saying stuff like “please god just take my life instead of his”. My dad would scream at my older brother horrible things and I don’t blame him because my brother was horrible. He would steal things like my favorite video games and pawn them for drug money and I was too scared of upsetting my parents so I wouldn’t tell them. I loved my brother so much I wanted to protect him even though he was ruining my life. I would find his burnt spoons and pills and just sob all night. I watched him but drugs from weird cars in front of our house when I’d get home from school. Sometimes the drug cars would sit outside my house when I was home alone and I was so scared and confused. I would walk past his room and he would be sitting still with a blank expression staring at one corner of his room like a zombie. He actually overdosed and was dead until he was resuscitated in the ER. My parents would pay for different rehabs and they never worked. My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house. I felt so alone I would cut myself and make myself throw up or I would hysterically cry randomly at school or with friends. I wanted to just get in a car accident or find the courage to kill myself. I couldn’t ever get help or tell my family because it would make the situation worse. All I wanted was for my mom to hug me and say everything was going to be okay. 

Now I’m 19 and he’s doing much better. He seems to be clean but you can never really be sure, but he seems much happier. But I am left with this scar that I don’t think will ever go away. I fear drugs of any kind, I fear alcohol, I fear it all. Being around people doing those things make me panic on the inside. I do a good job usually of hiding it, but then I go home and cry. It’s hard when everyone I know my age does all sorts of drugs and drinks. I’ve lost friends, It’s caused a breakup. I avoid movie scenes with drug use because it makes me that sick to my stomach and memes or people talking about drugs absolutely ruin my day. The thought of my boyfriend smoking or drinking still disturbs me greatly and makes me cry, but I don’t want to control him. I know people use these things to find peace but I don’t know why and it makes me so intensely upset. I wish I could protect everyone from these things but I can’t. I know i sound crazy. I don’t cry as much anymore. Sometimes the urge to hurt myself returns but I do well at suppressing that. I don’t know if this is ptsd or if this was considered trauma I don’t know anything I just know I feel hopeless."

Couple of years ago I broke up with my ex girl (no here’s number jokes included) and she started acting suicidal and self-harmfull. So I decided thats it’s my duty to help her through the hard times. I don’t want to go too much on details but after months of daily suicide threats and runs to her house to see if she had already swallowed the pills, I started to fall apart.  After that, It still took me around a month of panic attacks and puking in the schools’ bathroom to tell her that I couldn’t take it anymore. The worst part of the story is that now she’s fine and I’m struggling with PTSD, panic disorder and depression. I’ve been secretly ashamed of how ”easily” I got fucked up so bad. I always thought PTSD as a veterans and sexual-assault victims problem. Would be nice to hear if someone has PTSD because of similar abuse. I really hope that all of you get better.

We had 2 female helpers and 1 male helper. All of whom lived with us. The male helper and I used to spend lots of time together. I grew attached to him. I don’t remember exact moments but I remember singular pictures here and there of it. He was a well loved member of our family. In the beginning I never told anyone what he was doing to me. I loved and adored him, but absolutely hated what he did to me. He basically used my mouth as a whole.

Slowly after he left us, I was always confused as to what to make of it. Never telling anyone as I was scared that nobody would believe me. Eventually I told my older sister. This was when I was about 18 years old. She then forced me to tell my parents. 

After I told my parents, nothing was ever said about it. My biggest fear of not being believed was coming to life. This year when I am 24 years old I found out through my counsellor (whom I begged to see) that my dad doesn’t believe me.

I have lost my ability to do anything. The whole in my body and feeling of worthlessness has never been greater. I have this hatred that has built up for my father. I love my mother with all of my heart, and she really tries to love and support me. My biggest fear is losing my mother.

My girlfriend and I have been together for over 7 years, she gives me an infinite amount of love and support. I constantly don’t understand how I deserve it. I hate myself. I have a about 7 friends whom I keep in close contact with who would do absolutely anything for me. I don’t understand why. I am worthless in my opinion. I don’t deserve the love and support that I get from these people.

I won’t commit suicide because of these people as I feel like it would be unfair on them. However I constantly feel like a burden to everyone. This writing is terrible, but I don’t have good words for how I feel.

6655277a511e217561d5a869	1504_ptsd	"Telling about the abuse Warning, possible triggers!

When I was 12, I was groomed and molested by my Grandfather. Admittedly this is really hard for me to write down as I've yet to really accept and work through what has happened. Even if it's been 6 years. 

2 months ago I was watching a Video about psychology (as I do almost everyday) and the topic was about the Sexual abuse that can occur with children without them realising that what's happening is wrong and scarring. That hit the nail in the coffin and the realisation hit me like a train. I wanted to throw up, curl in a ball and scream, and cry.... After 2 months of torture on my part I finally told my mum. While this happened my grandfather(abuser) frequently visits and calls almost everyday. I get panic attacks everytime it's brought up or if I'm reminded of it in some way... The guilt and shame is killing me. So it's really hard for me to express and talk about my feeling about my... Situation

I can't take it anymore. I can't stand to even think about that pedophile let alone be in the same room as him. So I've cut off ties, not answering the phone or hiding etc. My grandmother started meddling (It's typical behaviour for that part of the family) and won't stop asking questions no matter how much I tell her to leave it. So she started asking my dad questions and he doesn't take well to them. 

So this brings me to my current dilemma. I don't know if I should tell my father and/or How I should tell him. I'm stuck in a corner and this could destroy my family. I don't even know if they'll believe me or not! My family sort of despise me because I'm Granddaddy's favourite (ain't that ironic?) 

Mum really helps a lot but she's not always there to help me out of the situations. So I'm turning to you for advice, Reddit. 

Please, any advice on this would be greatly appreciate. I know this might not be the best subreddit to ask this but.... You're my only hope now."	[]	[{'start': 53, 'end': 114, 'span': '\r\nWhen I was 12, I was groomed and molested by my Grandfather', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

In February 2019 my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD due to a sexually abusive, manipulative, compulsive liar relationship I was in in 2010. It was short, but very intense and I did not go to therapy properly for it til this past November. (2018) 2018 I was in a serious relationship for the first time since that abusive relationship and so some of the things that trigger me would not have come up until then because they are related to being in an intimate relationship. 

This relationship was so good and I was so excited because I felt like I learned that I could love and trust. Then for some reason, it started to become rocky and this is when my episodes really ramped up. I did not truly understand that I was having flashbacks until after it was all over but essentially this SO told me that ""whatever I was doing"" to address my PTSD wasn't working and that I had ""lost the ability"" to control my emotions and I was not as resilient as I used to be. I would get so mad and upset and irrational and he would too. After my worst flashback he did not speak to me for 2 weeks - because he needed space. (I don't blame him, but it was excruciating and I felt so much shame because I was reeling from the trigger) After the 2 weeks he broke up with me.

This all cut me to my core. Now, 7 months later, I'm finally coming out of the haze of sadness from that relationship ending. I'm in grad school for Social Work, I have my own apartment, I have two jobs and an internship. I'm doing what I wanted to do!! But I still am feeling so dejected and also really struggling to make friends because I'm nearly 30 and it's hard to make new friends but also I'm realizing, because I'm afraid to get close to people in case I have a trigger moment and they can't take it. 

I don't know if anyone has any thoughts but I just feel really small and alone and I have appreciated reading your posts so I thought I would reach out.

I’m having some difficulty understanding what’s going on in my head at the moment. I think I may have PTSD, at least, I appear to meet the DSM 5 criteria for it. The thing is that even the thought of PTSD had never popped into my head before a couple nights ago.

I was watching a cop drama where the main character had to go to a therapist for an evaluation. All of a sudden, BAM, that sounds a lot like me.

So here’s my story.

Last year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed. I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can’t and even if I could I probably wouldn’t share). Unfortunately, she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn’t save her. I had to relay all this whilst it was happening to my dad and my brother who were back in our home country. 

They were able to come out the next day luckily but I was alone all night.

Ever since then I’ve thought that I was just grieving normally for my mother. I do go to a therapist about it once a week. Whenever I talk to people about what happened they always say “it must have been so traumatic” but I myself have never used that word to describe it, not even in my own thoughts.

Now though, I can’t stop thinking that this may actually be affecting me. Actually, I knew how badly I was being affected but I just thought that it was part of the grieving process. I called a friend tonight and told her what I was thinking and she told me that she’s suspected it for months! She didn’t know how to tell me what she thought. I’m not mad or upset at her or anything but I am a bit shocked that someone could come to that conclusion so long before I even thought about it! 

I’m not self diagnosing but I would like to know for certain if it is PTSD or not. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and am planning to ask her.

Did any of you have this BAM realisation? How did you go about things afterwards?

Thank you for reading"	[]	[{'start': 557, 'end': 827, 'span': 'I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can’t and even if I could I probably wouldn’t share).

6655277a511e217561d5a869	2564_ptsd	"So Beyond Angry Right Now TW: Sexual Assault, politics, Kavanaugh. 

So, I just need to vent. I have been off Facebook for years but over the past year have gotten back on Facebook to see what my family is up to. During my time off Facebook I think being on Reddit has made me a bit bolder to speak up and say what's on my mind. 

Anyway, somebody shared an article about Kavanaugh that makes a very large leap to claim that all the accusers are lying. I realize there is very little evidence either way but this article was making very unfounded claims. So I started debating with the article sharer. 

However, someone unrelated who's cover photo was a picture of text that says ""I have PTSD - Pretty Tired of Stupid Democrats"" took it upon themselves to call me a stupid liberal and say I need a normal life and common sense. 

I think that cover photo might be one of the singularly most offensive things I've ever seen. Not to mention, my chance at a normal life was taken from me when I was raped, and have since had to struggle with PTSD. 

I just can't even express the rage it makes me feel right now. I have since removed myself from that conversation so that I can cool down, but how can people be so crass and mean? I guess I know how, people are terrible. But it just kills my already small faith in humanity. 

I guess I just needed to vent. What makes people think it's ok to turn an actual mental illness into a joke to attack people they disagree with?? Has anyone else seen this stupid picture before? Sexual Assault PTSD aside, I used to know a veteran with PTSD who was a Democrat. It's just that cover photo was so brazenly insensitive. 

I guess I just need a place to express my anger that isn't on that post."	[]	[{'start': 949, 'end': 1012, 'span': 'my chance at a normal life was taken from me when I was raped, ', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
6655277a511e217561d5a869	2413_ptsd	New to this. (Sorry if this is scattered thoughts bundled together) Long story short— I had a car accident about 8 months ago. I had to be airlifted. I only remember hearing the sounds of the helicopter and I don’t remember anything beyond that besides waking up in a hospital with a tube down my throat begging for water that I couldn’t drink for 3 days. I arrived to the hospital with just enough blood to be breathing still. I fractured my pelvis, broke my ankle on the opposite side of my body, and broke my elbow on the the same side of my fractured pelvis. I couldn’t walk for 3 months and I was in a retirement/ rehabilitation facility for 3 weeks after being in ICU for 2 weeks after my accident where the “nurses” and doctors there had never dealt with someone as young as me. It was hell in there and finally I was able to go home and be bed bound then wheelchair accessible then  I began to walk again after a lot of physical therapy~October, my accident was early July. Well I felt like those times there was so many crazy things going on it hasn’t been until now where Im returning to a somewhat normal lifestyle (attempting at least) where Ive started to go through what I can only describe as panic attacks, insomnia, and nightmares. The panic attacks started about a month ago. And just simply thinking about being job less and just how different my life has changed to what it is now causes a huge influx of negative thoughts and I just dont want to leave the house and deal with life. I dont feel like Im myself anymore like the old me died in that accident. I wanted to get out of my bed for so long when I was bed bound that now I recluse in it because of the anxiety. I am currently taking pain pills a much lesser dose then I started with. I started attending group classes and a lot of the time I get told I need to be more honest with myself and accept that what happened was traumatic and I tend to down play it most of the time I talk about it. I just wanted to let you guys in on this because it was this subreddit that convinced me to attend a group therapy in the first place.

6655277a511e217561d5a869	1657_ptsd	"Sleeplessly confused Wanting to sleep for an eternity but terrified of never waking up from my endless dreams. Dreams full of confusion that I'm left to either ponder or forget in the following day. Thoughts of the hidden lies I tell the world or the endless horrors I've lived. Thoughts of the never ending pain that I deemed fair in my life. But then that leads me to question. How are my horrors fair? How am I getting justice?  
I can't change my smile, only the intensity. I can't change my pale skin with the freckles, only the scars I put make up on to hide. I can't change my past and what others have taken from me. I can't change the fact that those memories are my horrors. Those my memories are my dreams. 
These memories give me comfort and pain. The catch 22 of my mind. They remind me that I've been used, abused, stolen, and deceived. In my dreams I'm lulled by the love I thought was there. Then I'm trapped in my unraveling prices to be loved. Show this, do that, please him, don't fight back; all to here the sweet words from poisonous touches. To get attention from wolves in too clean sheeps clothes. I never knew when the price was too much till it was too late. 
Too late meaning, my 11 year old mind not seeing myself being groomed. My 12 year old hunger being denied to stay 98 lbs. My 13 year old body not understanding that being molested was wrong. My 14 year old body was now the product of a 45 year old man and the countless nights he snuck in my room. Then my 15 year old emotions only wanting it to stop but too afraid to end it. 
End it, was what I wanted but it won't stay in my past. End the tears when he leaves, they only come more. End the long nights of his encounters, but they come just as frequently just in a different form. End the pain in my body, the feeling of his breath on my neck, the feeling of hands over my mouth. The end... but it won't. 
It won't since I've been told it was my fault. It won't since he will be seen as an amazing man, while he hides the fact he's a monster. It won't since he lives happy and my family has a new person to gossip about. So it won't.

Tl;dr: I experienced stuff that I'm not sure qualifies as traumatic? Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. 

Hey Everyone,   
First time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   


1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. 
2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. 
3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him ""If you're gonna hit me, do it!"" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said ""Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her"". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me ""oh I fight with my brothers too!"" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. 
4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. 
5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that ""if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault"".   


In my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole ""PTSD"" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   
Idk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this. Any comments appreciated."

To give you some background, I use to work in a locked mental health facility for children and it wasn't the best run facility. I worked there a year and a half and I had my hair pulled, been spit on, punched, kicked, slapped, insulted, ect. There were periods of time where I would get hurt everyday at work for weeks. Not to mention hearing/seeing all the stories of what the kids went through and having to do ""therapeutic holds"" on children that are going through a mental health crisis.  I ended up leaving that job shortly after I got divorced and I have a great new job that is way lower stress/anxiety/trauma.

&amp;#x200B;

Well now here I am about a year later and every morning when I wake up I panic about having to go to work. I get so worked up I generally throw up every morning while getting ready for work and sometimes I have to pull over to throw up again. I have talked about this to my old therapist and I am finding a new therapist (just changed over insurance due getting a new job). I don't know what to do about this. The thing that has helped most is deep breathing exercises, but it usually takes me calming down on the hour drive to work to just get to a point where I can function. Any suggestions?"

Throwaway account because my boyfriend follows me .

Hello, I’m not exactly sure this will be beneficial for me but I  need to try I guess . From the age of 5 till the time I was 13 my cousin would  touch me and his sister. Fingering us “playing doctor” telling us that since it hurt it was our fault and something was wrong with us. See my cousin was caught with his sister but since I was so embarrassed I never said a things leading to her getting the help and therapy she needed while I dwelled with this self hatred for allowing it to continue so long.  I finally snapped and was hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I opened up to the psychiatrist as much as I felt comfortable doing. Which wasn’t much. Anyway I bounced between plenty of  therapists before giving up on therapy all together I’ve never really learned a good way to cope. (I had my first thoughts of self harm again recently and that’s scary to me I don’t want to fall back down that path) 
I recently got into a new relationship and I’ve never had a problem with this until recently. My mind likes to play this game where it twists the truth and so it has lead to a trust issue between me and my boyfriend. Which led to the flash backs returning, and it’s at very hard times like when we’re going to get intimate break down and start crying. Which makes me feel like complete shit as my boyfriend doesn’t deserve it.  he’s very patient and understands since I opened up to him about what happened. He stops right away to make sure I’m ok I just don’t feel like it’s fair to him (or myself)  Anyway I guess what I’m asking is how do I go about releasing this pent up trauma and how do I help myself cope?"

62a92e04b776abb18e45f2e3	1673_ptsd	"Things get easier. My experience of getting better. Brief mention of abuse without getting into details (also start and end are pointed out) This post was supposed to be a rant. 
I was feeling a bit gloomy after a flash-back, but as I kept writing I started to calm down. Hence the change in the tone.

Also, I wanted to point out that what I'm talking about is obviously just a small part of the process of getting back on your feet, but still it felt essential to me. Everyone's experience is different and this is just my personal perspective. 

Sorry for my broken English, I hope this can be helpful to someone. 

I guess I have improved a lot in the last year. 
I really don't want to go back to the hole of despair I was trapped in, but sometimes I get scared I might let myself slip off into it again.

To prevent that, I make sure to bury any thoughts about my past very deep as soon as I sense them arise, of course some of them manage to sneak out and they get back at me in spades.

I still get glimpses of moments I had successfully forgotten about. 
It makes me feel like I'm still there, but it happens less and less frequently and every time it gets easier to snap back. 

Up until a year ago, I was leading a life that was split in half between the present and the past. 
The present seemed to be so dull, as if I were half-asleep, while the past felt so much more real and threatening.

I used to be so angry, I don't know how else to describe it other than it felt like fire was running through my veins. It was the only thing I felt and I couldn't help but cling to it, since it seemed to be my life's sole purpose and sustenance.
 
I kept reliving the events of my trauma, going through them in my head over and over again. Each time getting angrier and angrier. 
I didn't mind it at all, I was actually glad for this blind rage. As if it fueled me. 

**START OF TRIGGER WARNING**

I had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. 

**END OF TRIGGER WARNING**

After I escaped, ordinary life was simply idle.
Hadn't it been for this anger, I would have just gone numb.

Although comforting, I came to realize that I would have never been able to move forward without letting go of it all, the anger, the constant replay of gruesome scenes in my mind, the pointless questions that would never find any answers.

Things were also getting out of hand, to the point where I involuntarily broke my friend's arm as I was startled by her giving me a hug unexpectedly. 
I was horrified at what I had done. 
I'm a petite girl but I've been fighting professionally for a long time and I couldn't bear the thought of harming someone whose only fault was getting caught between my messed up brain and me. 

It's a hard process to forget about the abuse I had been through as a child and then again as an adult, but I'm managing and it does get easier. 
I had never thought it to be true, but time really does heal all wounds.

But most importantly it's the people you love. Keep them close. Even if you feel the need to cut everybody off and confine yourself in your pain, don't. Don't let this trauma induced sentiment prevail.
It's not what you or your loved ones need. 
The ones we care about are the only thing that keeps us grounded to reality, to the present. 
You can take small steps, there's no rush, you don't have to let everyone in on everything you are feeling unless you want to. Just try, as difficult as it is, to be open to their affection. 

Being passionate about something is hard after you have survived trauma and readjusting to everyday life is particularly disorienting when you don't have a purpose, you just feel hollow. A good place to start is making it a point to be able to take care of the people you love. Having to be someone your dear ones can rely on, eventually makes you get back on track and you are going to become even stronger than you were before. 

It's ironic how being a survivor makes you feel so dead inside, it might feel like you have lost all control over your own body and mind. 
But please know this kind of feelings are only temporary. You have gone through a nightmare and made it out alive. You will overcome these feelings as well. 
 
You won't have to look back at the person you were before in sorrow, you are growing to become someone you will learn to love. 
You will have suffered greatly and still been able to pull yourself back up, you can accomplish anything you put your mind to. 

Life only gets better and better from here, it's tough but so are you."

And note that I am currently in a safe environment and in no way am in danger. The only issue is the mental issues. Also here's my trigger warning if you're reading to read.

               I've been having a lot of issues recently. I... need a public place to vent where things can stay anonymous. It's been getting worse recently but I've had what I can only assume is depression anxiety and PTSD which left untreated for the last 7 or 8 years as I do not have a good way to get to a doctor. I self harmed for years but stopped after Thanksgiving (American holiday) in 2017. But since before that I've been having an issue where occasionally I would have violent flashbacks of my abusive father and self harm and feel like I'm back in those moments and then to only get shot back into reality starring into nothing while in the midst of a panic attack. It didn't happen all the time and would usually be a few days up to a few weeks apart but recently it has become common and happens 1 or 2 to 3 or 4 times, if bad, a day. This mixed with a constant depressive feeling of dread, depression, and regression has made everything incredibly hard to deal with and I've start to crack recently and break down more often. 

                 I... don't really know what else to say. What are your opinions? I'm just sort of struggling right now and need to vent. Thank you everyone."	[]	[{'start': 778, 'end': 843, 'span': 'occasionally I would have violent flashbacks of my abusive father', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
62a92e04b776abb18e45f2e3	1786_ptsd	"Significant other of 17.5 years has been diagnosed with PTSD for a year now due to traumatic event (he’s a civilian). I’m at a loss. Some background information. He (32 m) and I (31 f) have been together almost 18 years now. We moved to our current location after I accepted a job position about two years ago, and he had his little brother move down about four months after that. We all got really close. Flash forward to October 2018.

He and his brother work out of town, on the morning of the incident his little brother was killed right in front of him for absolutely no reason, seriously, no reason. He blames himself, has been in and out of rehab centers (he uses illicit drugs, and most recently, alcohol) to numb himself and avoid reality. Our family lives about 14 hours from us, so really it’s just him and me. 

Please understand I am not trying to portray myself as a victim. I just honestly don’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to face what happened and work through the trauma, he just tries numbing it. Everything gets taken out on me. I listen, boy do I listen, to every detail of what happened that morning. I understand it is good for him to get it out, but I am not a licensed therapist. He refuses to see a professional. Lately, his drinking has increased so much he drinks straight liquor like it’s water and I become his verbal punching bag. He blacks out every night not remembering what he said/did. It’s getting to be a lot. 

I know this isn’t him, that it’s his PTSD. I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but in all honesty, I’m at such a loss. It’s a lot on my shoulders to take care of everything that isn’t related to him and his PTSD and then adding that on top of my regular responsibilities. I have no support from his family, it’s kind of like an out of sight out of mind ordeal. 

Honestly, at this point, I’m just looking for some help or guidance. Like I said, I don’t want the relationship to end, and his brother wouldn’t want his death to result in the either. But there is only so much I can do to help him without him getting the actual help he needs, professional help. What am I doing wrong? Are there things I could be doing different? Is it selfish to want to put “me” first in my own life?

Sorry for the rambling. I start therapy for myself next week but it’s been a pretty rough week so far, I figured I’d try reddit as one of my last resorts. 

Thanks all."	[]	[{'start': 508, 'end': 584, 'span': 'his little brother was killed right in front of him for absolutely no reason', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
62a92e04b776abb18e45f2e3	1509_ptsd	"A couple weeks ago I randomly remembered about 1.5-2 years I guess I forgot. I repressed most of my childhood and I like it that way, but I didn't realize I was missing adult years. Anyone else lose large amounts of time as an adult? I'm not sure how to explain this. I'll start by saying I moved out right at 18, but ages 19-21 have always been hard to remember. I'm 37. Before now, I could tell an occasional story about those years but I couldn't ever get a timeline to make sense for me and never wanted to delve too deep into it. Mostly I think my memory loss is a protective measure and I appreciate and enjoy it. 

All of a sudden, out if the blue, it hit me like a ton of bricks and the full extent of my repression was glaringly apparent. It was to the point where up until recently, the information about where I thought lived during part of that time would have even been wrong. Now I'm being flooded with memories of a time I now know I didn't want to remember. I don't want them. 

It also makes me question my reality. For example: A couple years ago something happened at a bar where I was sexually assaulted. I always thought I was roofied because that time is just gone. I don't know what happened, just that I was missing for a while after going outside, and I got out of someone's grip pulling my arm really hard in the alley behind the bar. I was covered in bruises and could barely walk for days afterwards. Talking it over with some friends, I'm not sure I'm missing enough time to have been drugged, and no idea what happened in that alley.

Iam 24 years old and for more than a decade iam suffering. My current situation is really difficult. This year i wanted to go to university again, but my medical condition is a living hell. My problem is my body is 24/7 in an ""emergency situation"". That means it feels to me like my own body is a prison/enemy to me. I can barely breathe, i dont sleep well (for years) and my stomach is so hard to the point i feel emotionless. It feels to me this is taking 80% of my energy. Over the year  ""being depressed"" became the new normal for me.

The relationship to my parents is really difficult. I experienced a lot of abuses. Want some examples?
- At age 7 i was trying to sleep in a room with my brother in the evening. I was scared of ""monsters"" under the bed, so i asked my little brother if he could come to sleep beside me (children), so i dont need to be scared anymore. A few moments later my fundamental religious father came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground. Then he started to beat my little childrens body with his foot. My stomach hurt was hit by his foot. 1 Minute later my mum came to him, but she just observed and didnt do anything. Then it began to hurt so much, i was thinking i would die. So i crawled on my knees to my mothers feet and told her  ""mommy please tell him to stop"". But he kept going by this time punching me in the face, so blood came out of my nose. As he noticed the blood, he grabbed me by my t-shirt and pulled me like a dog to the bathroom, where he forced me to wash my blood. I was so little i couldnt reach the water so he gave me something to stand above. While cleaning the blood i was crying and most importantly my body was vibrating enormously.

- At age 8 i should take my little brother to play with my friend outdoors. Like most children i wanted to play with my own friends and don't want to ( Alone the fact letting a 5years and 8 years old playing for several hours alone on the street is crazy). Then my father saw me coming down the street and asked where i was, i said ""i was on the playground"". As he knew i didnt take my brother with me, he was so aggressive i got scared of him. I literally was so scared i began to run away from him. I ran the street down and now comes the crazy thing. He began to run wild after me and i screamed as loud as a i could ""HELP"", but nobody noticed. As i couldnt run anymore, i instinctively put my hands before my face, in fear he would punch me in the face. 

-At Age 6 i behave badly in the opinion of my parents and they scared to beat me, so i left the building block and waited infront of the bus stop for several hours in the cold. I Brief the whole time and each time a bus come by (every 20 minutes) i started to control it, so no stranger noticed me. Every two minutes i looked to the door, to look if they let me in again.

- At age 16 i was really hungry and cooked a little meal for myself. My father told me i should share it with my brother. I told him no, there is enough left he can cook for himself, he is old enough. He was so angry he took my plate with the food on it and threw it in front of me into the garbage. Then he became more aggressive and and destroyed the plate with a spoon in front my eyes and forced me to clean everything up. At this time school already was really hard for me emotional, so i cried silently desperate while cleaning everything.

- One day at age 15 or so he came in a aggressive mood in my childrens room ( dont remember why), we had a discussion and then began to threat me by coming really near to me, holding his fingers between his teeths saying ""iam craazy""."

I feel so physically sick and repulsed by the fact that nearly a year and over 5 court dates later, he's still unwilling to own up to what he's done to me. Just when I thought that I would never have to see him again (I transferred schools) I find out that I have to face him in court. The mere thought of this has lead me to feel like my lungs are collapsing and my entire body feels weak and defeated. Going to trial means re-experiencing my trauma all over again, except with him present to see just how much damage he did to me. I don't want him to see how much he has destroyed me and taken my piece of mind. I don't want him to get the sick satisfaction of seeing me cry but I know that going through a trial will bring me to tears. I fear that seeing him again will retraumatize me in a way and undo the progress that I have made in therapy. Any advice or simply kind words would be appreciated.

However, keep in mind that hypnosis doesn't work for everyone. I think regardless, speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial. It seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward. In addition, if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you receive the treatment that you deserve.

66463e1634506c3ca42bec35	2473_ptsd	"How to balance managing triggers/stimuli and living a normal life Hey everyone how's it going this is my first post. In fact I only registered to make this post.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think a lot about PTSD until a year or two ago when I just sorta got hit full force with something I didn't understand. As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything. That worked okay for a few years, although I was really struggling mentally during that time, but then the wheels just came off at some point where I was too messed up in the brain to operate normally in society.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get these nightmares that were so bad that they wanted to use me as an experiment for a new drug that's being trialed for use by the U.S. Military. I forget what it's called but essentially it's this blood pressure medication, but when you take it you never dream again for the rest of your life. I mean these nightmares were so insane I actually thought I might be possessed by a demon and considered seeking help from a priest.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get this anxiety that got so bad that I could not turn my back to someone or all this other weird shit. I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from. It was like I was being poisoned surreptitiously or something. I thought I was a tough guy but this was like physiological in nature. It made me so sick sometimes that I'd puke for days and not be able to sleep and I'd get dehydrated and have to go to the ER and get saline and a MRI.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I went to some therapist because I thought I had an anxiety disorder or something, but they were like no you got PTSD. I didn't believe it at the time, I was like ""yeah right"", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood/brain/skull/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

I got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.

&amp;#x200B;

They operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.

&amp;#x200B;

They forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some ""creative"" interrogation or whatever) they never recover. This is a concept I'm only becoming aware of now.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is with triggers. In fact, it got so bad that I had to quit my job six months ago and I've been out of work since then and barely left my house in all that time in order to avoid triggers/stimuli. Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say ""hands kill"" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people. If I trust someone enough to tell them what I've just posted here they see me as broken and crazy and want nothing to do with me. So it's kind of a lose-lose situation and I've been on my own with this for about 13 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't stay in my house forever and never go outside again so what can I do to bring myself back into the fold when I hit one of those triggers? Even when I'm doped up on tranquilizers it doesn't always fully stop the rush of memories and sensations that come flooding into my soul. I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I was on paxil at the same time. I instantly became addicted and a friend who hung out with us then says she remembers I was constantly ill and sleeping and that the guy was giving me pills all the time, she said he told me they'd help me feel better but now I think it may have been something to keep me doped up so he could bring people into the house, I have a memory of him bringing a friend and the friend was smoking heroin and I was too out of it to care at the time. I lost the apartment I was living in due to not paying rent and I ended up with a friend of his that lived in the complex and was also a tweaker and much older than me. This is where it got very bad, he was very sadistic and verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. He told me he was intentionally trying to make me go crazy, and he would just stand there and smile and taunt me when he got me to the point of crying. He talked about ways to kill me, and weird things like splitting my mind and making me reborn and being one of the ""elite"" by being tortured. Just really insane and confusing and he kept me in a constant state of anxiety to the point where I would have panic attacks when he wasn't home, especially after I found him hiding in the pantry when I thought he had left... he was physically abusive as well but it went deeper than the ""normal"" abuse because he would have a totally different voice, different face everything when he would talk about that weird stuff it literally scared me to my core because it was like being talked to by a demon... and he made me feel so dehumanized and worthless, he told me there were all these things wrong with me and I developed a fear of going outside which lead to me being trapped in the apartment with him for 7 months. I believe he drugged me as well as revenge for having him put in jail but that is a whole other long and horrible story. All of this happened in a short period of time. 

My memory is really messed up when it comes to all of that. I don't know exactly when it began, and there are huge chunks of time missing. I actually had a point where I just ""woke up"" but I was sitting in my bed, I didn't remember ANYTHING for several minutes and even as things came back to me, I had this horrible weird feeling like my name and my room were not mine. I didn't know what I was doing before that and my bed and the furniture were moved and I still don't remember moving anything. I have never understood that but when this happened I returned to the abusive guy (I was all alone, as an addict he was the ONLY person who still talked to me and at that point I was convinced that I was crazy and none of the things he did happened) and he acted all emotional and told me some weird stuff about how it finally happened and that ""Caeley #1"" has died and I was now ""Caeley #2"". It made me feel more alone and terrified and I now wonder about the possibility of having DID (I had traumatic things happen as a child) or if it's part of PTSD and depersonalization/derealization disorder I've been diagnosed with. 

Another thing I wonder about is why I am so emotionally detached from my memories. I remember it like it happened to someone else and I was watching, not like it happened to me. It makes me wonder if I even have PTSD at all. I only hear about people with PTSD being fearful and crying and everything but I am not like that, yet it still affects me and my life in other ways. Until recently (I think having a baby has changed it) I was unable to cry. I talk about it constantly, I think about it constantly, but it's the same memories over and over and I feel nothing when I think about them, just disturbed by the lack of feeling. I feel like not feeling anything makes it even harder to move past it... it's like I'm stuck. Like I blocked out the emotions then when they got too horrible to deal with and then I just stayed like that. I cry about other things, I feel love and everything but I'm totally detached from the memories. I factually know how I felt then. I know I was in absolute despair and so much pain but like someone else TOLD me how they felt. 

When I talk about this stuff, I do not feel any anxiety at all, but my back tightens up and I begin shaking and getting cold, every time. When I'm talking about it out loud, if I go on too long the tightness in my back spreads through my body and makes it hard for me to breathe and I have to stop talking. Once I stop talking about it, it goes away. It has made it difficult for me to explain everything to a therapist. It's very weird and I'm serious when I say I do not feel the anxiety whatsoever when I talk about it... it's just my body reacting that way. When I was typing what happened, I got those physical symptoms and when I started typing this, it faded away. Is it still PTSD if I am emotionally detached from the memories? Is there a type of therapist or someone that can help me connect to those memories and move past it? I was seeing a counselor in my home town but I got married and moved, and she wasn't helping any way because she didn't understand what I meant when I told her about the detachment. I just really need peace, and to move on. I feel like I'm just trapped in these memories until I feel like they were real... as weird as I know that sounds. I hope someone out there understands.

It hurt everywhere. I wanted to close my eyes but. My brother.. my brother. I think he is hurt. I look at the other side of the street and my father seems half dead. No, no.. no. Papa, are you okay?

66463e1634506c3ca42bec35	2503_ptsd	"Anyone have elevated heart rate related to PTSD? I have my heart rate spike when I have to do things related to my PTSD. If so, how is it treated? PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE QUESTION IF YOU CAN, EVEN IF YOU DON’T READ THE REST!



Here is the long backstory you don’t have to read, since I really just want to know how other people have treated elevated heart rate related to PTSD:

I’m afraid I’m about to end up being treated for a heart condition I don’t have, as I only have heart rate spikes temporarily when my anxiety is triggered. It used to make me agoraphobic because I was so convinced I was going to have a heart attack and die &amp; really interrupted my ability to function &amp; would go months at a time without leaving my house at all. I worked through that and although I still get the racing heart when I have to do things that relate to the PTSD, I am able to tell myself that it’s temporary and will go away when the situation is over.  I used to take 6 msg of Xanax a day just to get out my front door and now I don’t need anything. 

Problem is that I also have ADHD which I do require medication for...I get goldfish brain to the point I had 3 car accidents in 3 weeks off medication. At my last visit the guy I saw had issues with my heart rate and told me to see my pcp &amp; get clearance to continue on the medication I was taking. I’ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don’t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn’t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn’t be enough and he’d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don’t know what to do.  

On top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I’m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I’m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we’re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they’d be better off because now I’m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control. He made me fill out the depression questionnaire (I was previously treated for major depression with TMS &amp; am on Prozac still) and I answered honestly about thinking my family would be better off if I was dead nearly every day and I was going to tell him that I was feeling very guilty about the impact of my mental health on my family. But he never picked up or even looked at the form. I left truly believing my family would be better off without me because now everything is about to get much worse for me and therefore them. So I’m obsessing about dying suddenly but also thinking I should die for the sake of my family. 

This whole event just upset me so much it made me start thinking about the whole traumatic event again in detail.and how unfair it is that the person that caused all this did 6 years in prison but got to move on with his life. And here I am 20 years later feeling sentenced to life. I know I’m going to be right back to having flashbacks and panic attacks and seeing his face in every stranger. I really wish I could restart this day and never go to that appointment. 

All of this could be over if I could just not have situational heart rate spikes but he offered me no solutions to what I can do about that. I’m hoping someone here has had similar issues and how you handled it. It’s not related to the medication because I’ve had this for decades even unmedicated and I purposely didn’t take it the last 3 days out of fear of this exact thing happening. So even if I just didn’t take it anymore, I’m still going to have these spikes that he says could stop my heart."

As soon as he let me go I scoured away like a hurt puppy and started having a panic attack.  At least I think that’s what it was.  I found it hard to breath.  Each breathe was hard to catch and felt like my first after deep sea diving.  I was shaking, scared to believe this guy just hurt me.

Today that ‘panic’ feeling came back.  What started as a back and forth argument turned into him ‘playing around’ with me.  Him behind me, covered my mouth and nose and just pulled my face back and my neck was straining.  I panicked because I’m 35 weeks now and the baby started tightening in my belly.  I couldn’t really breath.  I tried pulling his hands back away from my mouth to tell him to stop but his weight pushed me down into the couch making things harder.  By the time I got him to let go he started to pat my back as I gasped for air like the first night.  He asked me if I was ok..  I was shaking and I just repeated the same words as I did before, “please just get away from me”.  

I think that was a ptsd moment - I don’t know.  But since then I can’t even stand to be in the same room as him.  He says he was playing around but I know that wasn’t a game.  I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.  That was the scariest part.  It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion.

I'm walking to the subway and a group of younger city kids pass me, they start saying stuff to me and when they pass me, I still hear them. I say ""stfu"" as I pass them, fed up with the fucking day. They stop and threaten to fight me.

There is a building of projects across from me. Everytime I walk out there are these druggies lingering right across from me. I'm paranoid they know where I live. 

I'm going for a run and walking through the block to get to the river. I hear a guy say hi and whistling from a car parked on the street, but I didnt see which one it was coming from. 

I was walking to the river another day and a homeless drugged up man started saying hi and walking towards me and when I didnt respond and walked away he screamed IM GONNA GET YOU til I was out of distance. 

I go on the subway.. WITH my boyfriend for the first time in a while. A bunch of city kids get on and start doing a very very loud, screaming, violent type performance. I was triggered and they were stomping back and forth down the train cart. It was so long til the next stop. They kept coming over to us and across from me was the only other white girl on the cart. He puts his fist out for her to pound it. She didnt at first but he didnt move, so she did. Then he comes over to me and puts his fuckin fist out. My bf put his hand in front of me and pounded him for me. He walked away. He did this to the only two white girls on the train, even when I was with my bf. 

I was on a train alone and a bunch of city kids got on and were hanging from the subway handles and started talking shit about white girls and dumb bitches. 

I was walking to my apartment and heard a guysaying, blondie, blondieee behind me. 

I was walking on the river and a city guy passed me and said PUT A SMILE ON. Then I gave him a death stare and he called me a bitch. 

I've been raped by one of these city, drug dealer type guys. I live in this city alone. In my hometown these types of bad people would stalk me and pick on me for some reason. I'm a walking target. I dont feel safe leaving my house to go to the corner store. I'm scared to go on the subway to go ANYWHERE now. I dont have money to uber everywhere. It's so hard cause this could be real danger. It's so triggering and idk what to do. There is no one I know in this city or state. My bf is 2.5 hours away and very busy working full time. I am no contact and estranged from all family members and friends. I have a new therapist but even getting to her office is a fucking long trigger. 

AND WHAT PISSES ME OFF IS THAT.......if you dont respond to these people.. they WILL retaliate. And how fucked up is that? How fucked up is it to go on a subway and have a stranger shove their hand in your face for a ""pound."" And what if she didnt do it? She had no choice but to touch a fucking strangers hand that was invading her personal space, minding her own business on the train. They get mad when they are rejected because they look like idiots, when they are trying to be cool and have game when they do it. Are they trying to scare me on purpose? Are they this stupid? I shouldnt have to deal with this:-( I need a body guard. 

So I think.. I moved here bc I can walk places and the water and views. I used to love it. But I used to live in a nicer, expensive area that I cant afford. Even in those places there is crime.. I lived at my bf's before in the mountains and it was fucking hell. I didnt have a car and there were no stores within 30 min drive and no fun or anything. So I guess I need to settle for something in the middle. What sucks is that I am all alone.. I have no money or support... idk where I'll be at the end of the month.... my bf was supposed to get us a place but he bailed on me.. now I'm on my own. I feel bad getting mad at him for not visiting me, and not seeing him, and needing him just for me to leave my house and stuff.. I dont wanna put it on him but I literally have no one else.

Realistically it seems that the only way I will be able to gradually build a healthy sexual relationship in which I have the capacity to feel safe, connected &amp; embodied will be within the context of building an emotionally close romantic partnership with someone I feel strong romantic feeling for, am (at least at times) very attracted to, connect with well, and who is happy to understand my trauma and take things very slow.

But that sort of relationship is hard to find and build (especially having lots of attachment issues), and I feel so much sadness, fear &amp; frustration around the fact that I don't seem able to explore my sexuality outside of that context because attempting to do so is triggering 90% of the time.

I spent 20+ years in turmoil never realizing that PTSD was affecting me in so many ways. It always will affect me but now I have the power to understand it and work through it. You will not heal overnight, but if you truly open up to a therapist that you connect with there is hope.

62a338ff37a7da5958bbbde9	1603_ptsd	"My Partner has Disassociative Flashbacks and Runs Off - Need Tips Hello,

I'm new here but I have been looking for some help with this for a while and I thought I would try to see if someone from this community might be able to help. 

We are in the process of getting her to see a psychiatrist and start therapy, but until the medical insurance clears we can't do that. Until then, she has a habit of running off when she flashes back. When she does that she's sometimes in her PJs or without her phone. When that happens she ends up waking up lost and cold. She has also occasionally self-harmed while in a flashback. 

Due to all of these concerns, I would very much like to equip her with a GPS so that when she runs off I can find her quickly and bring her home ASAP. Does anyone have any tips on what kind to get? Or, perhaps some other tips about either other ways to deal with this or anything else. I am always open to suggestions. I just want what's best for her and for her to get through these rough episodes as quickly and as easily as possible.

Thank You."	[]	[{'start': 564, 'end': 622, 'span': 'She has also occasionally self-harmed while in a flashback', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I have PTSD from childhood abuse from my step-father (who I was raised to believe was my biological father) and from my mother who neglected me a lot throughout my life until I moved out.

I haven't lived with my mom and step-dad since 2011 and I still have vivid nightmares and flashbacks from my childhood.

One thing that I'd like to share with you all is a certain situation my step-dad put my family in. It was 2012, I was living with my grandparents, but went to Chuck E. Cheese with my mom, step-dad, and brother because my mom wanted me to go with them.
Everything was going okay until we left and got inside my step-dad's truck.

My step-dad has a permit to open carry a pistol, which I still have no idea how he was able to even get that gun, but then again, 'murrica. He caries that damn thing with him everywhere.

Anyways, we were all sitting in the truck, step-dad in driver's seat, mom in passenger seat, and my brother and me in the backseat. Out of the blue, my step-dad locks the doors of the vehicle and takes out his pistol. As soon as I saw him do this, I just thought to myself, ""great, we're all going to die now."" He pointed the barrel at our heads, smiling and waving his gun around like it was a toy. He almost never keeps the safety on.

""I could kill all of you right now, just put a bullet in all of your heads,"" he said, laughing, still waving the gun around.

""(S-D's name), please stop, you're scaring us!"" My mom cried.

He pointed the gun at her and told her, ""shut the fuck up!""

Then my mom said, ""this is why OP doesn't want to be around us anymore!""

My step-dad groaned and put away his pistol, claiming that my mom always has to ""ruin the fun"" and then drove me back to my grandparents' house.

About a year after he had gotten the gun (back in 2009), I was sitting in the living room watching War of the Worlds. Suddenly, he just pulled his pistol out in the living room, stood up, pointed the gun at me, and pulled the trigger. I screamed so loud and tried to cover myself up. I remember the feeling of the adrenaline rushing through my veins and feeling so helpless. Then, I heard him laugh at me and said, ""OP, stop being fucking ridiculous, the magazine's not even in!""

Well, he ended up accidentally killing his dog back in 2012. He took his sleeping pills before cleaning out his gun. The magazine was out, but there was a bullet stuck in the chamber. He accidentally pulled the trigger. It went straight through his arm chair and hit his dog in the head. She yelped slightly and tried to walk away before she slumped down and passed on. Luckily, I didn't have to witness that situation first hand (my mother had told me when I asked where the dog was when I was visiting her once).

That's not the only abusive thing that he's done, but it's been replaying in my mind ever since the school shooting in Florida.

The only ones I've told these stories to are my boyfriend, a couple trusted friends, and two therapists.

It terrifies me whenever people ask me how I feel about gun control. I feel like they will think I'm being ridiculous when I tell them I support stricter gun regulations, but honestly, if an abusive man with mental illness can LEGALLY get a firearm and threaten to shoot his family, pretend to shoot his own kid, and accidentally kill his dog with it, there should obviously be some sort of stricter regulations.

I haven't reported him. I've always been afraid to. My mom would always tell me as a child to not tell ANYONE that he abused me because she didn't want her kids taken away from her. That's still engraved in my brain, even to this day. Even the thought of reporting him gives me waves of anxiety.

He still has that gun and he still is legally allowed to open-carry. It's terrifying."

62a338ff37a7da5958bbbde9	2641_ptsd	"What are your flashbacks like? (possibly triggering for sexual abuse, rape, trauma) Hi everyone,

I'm pretty new to this sub and would like some insight into what others feel when they are experiencing flashbacks.

BACKGROUND INFO (skip if you want)

To give some background information on my experience, I was sexually abused/raped(?) by my step dad 4 years ago (and sexually abused by him multiple times over many years before) but I didn't get any medical help for that although I did tell my mum and boyfriend about it after the ""big happening"". I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. 

**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. 

For me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. 

Why do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   

TL;DR

my flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?

&amp;#x200B;

62a338ff37a7da5958bbbde9	1839_ptsd	"Being a young mom with PTSD When I first had my daughter I was unaware I had PTSD. I had shoved my childhood abuse in a closet to never look at it again.

But after months of sleep deprivation, fixating on having to be the perfect mom and excessive paranoid thoughts of my beautiful child dying or being kidnapped I was coming undone at the seems.

My husband pushes me to go to therapy and I learned that my erratic moods, my paranoia, my insomnia... just every little thing that made my life hard was real. It wasn't just me defective, born wrong. I knew I could do something to improve my life and my daughters.

However anger is a huge problem for me and one time when my daughter was about 1.5 years old, she was being a kid. An I just lost it, I screamed at her at the top of my lungs and slammed the kitchen cupboard so hard it broke off its hinges. The second I turned around and saw my daughters scared face I broke down.

I asked myself how I could do this? What kind of mother scares her child? I held her close and I promised myself I would die before I ever let my anger scare my child again. But its not so easy, the anger comes faster than I even have time to process whats happening and it bursts out of me. When I was young I used breaking this as a way to vent it, but I can't any longer go around destroying crap, especially not in front of a 2 year old.

My solution now? Lay down on the floor. Literally as fast as I can, lay down flat on the floor, face down and take a few deep breaths. Tell myself ""you're mental illness isnt who you are"" over and over again. When my daughter stops throwing a fit, or doing whatever it is that has dried up my patience levels and sees me, I pop up and go ""peek a boo"". She then laughs and goes ""again!""

The point is... My biggest fear is my mental health causing my child to be scarred, to have a broken childhood. It feels so good to take a moment I am not emotionally in control and turn it into something she sees as so innocent. She's too young to know that mom isn't perfect. Right now she wants mommy to be her perfect hero, and God dammit I'm gonna be that for her. 

I'm still in therapy and I've taken so many huge steps towards living a better life, I haven't even started my EMDR yet but I'm hopeful. I dont know who else out there has kids, or wants them. I know I'm not the perfect parent by any means but I'm trying, for me and for her."

(Is it even possible that I kinda have that since I was a toddler? Because I had the symptoms since I can think.)

So first I really thought: wow, now I know why I'm such a fuck up and now I can do the real therapy and be normal for once normal.

Boy, I was wrong. The time in the clinic were the worst. The clinic is specifically for PTSD sufferers. And yeah, I like to talk,and I talked to many people. Most people didn't say anything about their trauma and what they suffer from and I think that's the right thing to do in such a setting, I think it was even the rule. But you know how it is, some people told me the worst you can imagine. Told me what happened to them. How they suffer. How they hallucinate. Basically told me their life is an ongoing terror. All I was answering was like: oh I'm so sorry. I didn't have it so bad.

(Before I went to this clinic I was in a general hospital, there they told me to NEVER talk about my trauma until I'm in the PTSD clinic.)

When I finally had my trauma therapy session. I told her everything but I didn't feel it. It was like I don't care. I apologized and said I am wrong here.

I still am sure I do not have PTSD. A new therapist even told me laughing in my face I don't have it. I don't have vivid flashbacks. All I have is this mental void I get suck in. In this dark hole, where I can't get out. And nightmares.


It really gave me a form of relief when I first heard my diagnosis, like I know what I have to deal with now. But now I'm... just existing. I don't have something to fight, just myself.

I am really open about not having PTSD, I don't get mad if you tell me you don't think I have this, actually I feel like an imposter and I am angry at myself that I post here and take the support away from real PTSD survivors."

62a338ff37a7da5958bbbde9	2403_ptsd	"Requesting advice for anxiety around men... Hello humans, 

Below is a non-graphic summary of my current predicament and I was hoping to gain some advice!

I work in the live production world in general - concert/theatrical touring shows specifically - and I am 26 years old. This interest of mine began in high school when I had the opportunity to participate in our school's theater program for which I built sets, hung lights, and operated audio. This was also my first co-ed experience as from age 4 to 18 I went to an all girls school. To put on theater productions, however, we would work with the all boys school across the street. While I did well in theater back then, I was often ignored by the other students and teachers as they all came from the boys school and weren't sure how to interact with me... I think. Even when I became a vital participant in making productions happen, I kept to myself because I was also put off by the social dynamic of the boys.

I pursued this in New York City where I went to college during which time being the only woman on a production crew was also the norm. In 2013 and 2015 respectively I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body. The earlier was while working at a music festival, the later was during an off campus Black Student Union event. At those times I was eager to put those experiences behind me and forget about it however still fell into a sort of social anxiety/paranoia from 2015-2017 at which point I left New York City taking the freelancing rhythm of my life on the road. I was based out of Maryland that summer yet traveled to festivals all over the country for the job I had. Then I spent the next several months out in Virginia where I attended a great church with a female pastor and a congregation that consisted of about twenty women and two men. The community there was a big catalyst for me pulling myself back together.

After that I applied for and accepted my first permanent job in a management position at a concert venue in Washington DC but in the eight months I was there received progressively unnerving approaches from one of the male staff members. That compounded with my desire to get back on the road touring prompted me to quit. On top of all that, working with the same large group of men day to day made me more paranoid than working with men in passing on my typical 1-3 month gigs. However I assumed that it might've just been a symptom of the overall environment of that workplace.

Currently I am on my longest tour yet: an 11 month contract that began in July 2019. By this point I noticed the overwhelming pattern that I am only able to feel relaxed around women. I'm responsible for all the logistics of the tour unit. I'm the one who dictates who rides in each car and who is where on each bus. For all of these I've made it so I'm only with women whether that be in a car or in a certain area of the bus. However my fellow managers are men and recently I was forced to change the car assignments due to a change in our overall production schedule. Because of this I share an office with them in each arena or theater we go to. The crew, as per usual, is also mostly men. While things were mostly fine from July-November, since December I've been developing a growing sense of anxiety around my coworkers for seemingly no good reason. This culminated two weeks ago with me having a panic attack from sitting between two of them on a four hour plane ride during which they were asleep most of the time which resulted in lots of accidental physical contact and being breathed on.

I've been averse to physical contact my whole life but since college it evolved into more of an acute fear. Because of this I modified my wardrobe so that everything but my face and hands was covered at all times creating a bit of a buffer or even a deterrent.

My main frustration now is that these men are not doing anything. They are of no threat to me. Yet my body is reacting as if they were constantly. Due to the nature of my job I'm practically living with these people. Because of all this I'm searching for methods or strategies to make these feelings stop.

Any advice would be appreciated!"	[]	[{'start': 1144, 'end': 1220, 'span': 'I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

Then the shooting happened. To be clear, I didn't see/hear/experience anything. My life was never in actual danger, I was just living in the city at the time. At first it was disbelief, then fear (not knowing if they caught everyone) then crippling sadness. I had such a strong desire to run away and just go home but I couldn't right away. One of my coworkers was shot and spent months in ICU. I left Christchurch a little over a week after the attack. It felt wrong, but I had been offered a job back home and had already put my notice in at work.  

At first when I got back home and started my new job I was mostly fine. I was living with my parents until I could get an apartment in the city closer to work. I moved into my apartment in May and started having issues pretty quickly. Waking up multiple times a night, disoriented and sweaty. Random attacks of sadness and excessive anger over small problems. Being afraid of random people on the street. Wanting/needing to go do something (go to the store for example) and having a mental block. Anxiety over inconsequential things.

I started going to therapy in June and he diagnosed me with PTSD. He gave me an ESA letter to get a dog which has helped immensely. But the therapy wasn't helping, my brain would kind of just shut off and I wouldn't have anything to say and I wouldn't remember anything he would say. It was really just giving me more anxiety so I stopped going.

The diagnosis just doesn't feel right to me. Maybe because I know I was never in any actual danger. I get intrusive memories of the sadness and aftermath though.  Recently I've been even more hyper-vigilant than usual. I listen to audiobooks at work so my mind doesn't wander but it makes me anxious because I don't always know when someone approaches me, and I jump when they do. I get anxious walking outside when its too quiet, dark, rainy (hood up, peripheral vision blocked) or too crowded, and I cant walk with headphones in. I feel like I am constantly stressed and anxious even though I have no real reason to be. I scratch at arms and hands and have a hard time making myself stop.

I've always had problems with anxiety and mood swings so I'm having a hard time distinguishing from old symptoms and new. Part of myself keeps thinking that this isn't PTSD, this is just my anxiety coming back.

I don't even know what I am looking for from posting this, other than maybe if other people have gone through the same thoughts."

Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.

5d516fc44e371300160058dd	1664_ptsd	"Experiencing flashbacks and dissociation? Hi, my name is Liz and I'm a 30 year old woman with a lot of past trauma. Specifically, most of the trauma happened when I was a child living with parents who were abusive to one another and myself. I seem to be having flashbacks to things that have happened in my current relationship though. My partner likes to drink and I do not. I have no problem with anyone drinking around me, it's just that I don't find pleasure in it myself. He has acted in very scary and mean ways while drinking, and even though it has been over a year since he has done anything like this, I seem to be having issues. I lay in bed and sometimes have memories (that prior I didn't remember, or hadn't thought of in a long time) and they feel real. For example: he screamed in my face one time, and I had a memory of it the other night. I felt his voice causing my whole body to shake and rattle. I felt my life being possibly threatened. It took quite some time to shake the residual feelings and go to sleep. 

After experiencing the flashbacks, or experiencing something he has done, I tend to dissociate. At least I think it's dissociation. I actually welcome it and LIKE the feeling. I just kind of go away. I can't see what's in front of me or hear what people say. I go on autopilot or just stare into nothingness. It almost feels like maybe I'm going cross-eyed, lol. But no one has confirmed this for me. Although, as a child, my teachers would accuse me of ""daydreaming"" all the time. I would try to explain to my mom that I wasn't ""thinking"" of anything. I was just in a daze. She said, well whatever it is, just cut it out, lol. 

I like this feeling of being numb or calm and unaware. Is that unusual? Are these signs of PTSD? I really am not sure and just looking for some answers and possibly some people out there who are going through the same.  Most of the time I hear people describe dissociation as an unwanted or unpleasant thing. So, I'm a little confused as to why I welcome the sensation. (Most of the time, unless I'm trying to do something important)

I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I hope you are doing well during these difficult times.

M: mom
s: sister 
(Sorry bout this I just got tired of typing “my niece”, “my mom”, “my sister” without using names)

TRIGGER WARNING
deadass don’t know what all I typed but I know this probably needs a trigger warning 


So today my mom drove two hours to pick me up at my house (one working car between me and my husband right now) and two hours back to her house. I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn’t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn’t. 

I mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn’t doing anything wrong. Like my mother fucking pINCHED HER ARM and held it as tight as she could when she wasn’t walking fast enough to her liking at a gas station. I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn’t until I said something that she stopped. I think it’s just because I’m an adult now and she knows she can’t scare me into shutting up when I see something shitty. 

Not even the worse part of the day? For me at least. Poor N probably is just tired of feeling like everything she does is wrong. Maybe I’m projecting. I don’t think so though. 

We were out to eat with S who I haven’t talked to in months. I texted her months ago when I was in a deep depression and basically went off on her about the dent in the back of my skull. It wasn’t a lot. We were in an argument when I was probably 16. I turned around to walk away and she grabbed a can of food and just started hitting me over and over again in the back of my head. It hurts to this day. Every time I think about it I cry. 

ANYWAY, out at dinner. First time I’ve seen in S in months. M has convinced me to try and mend the relationship. I start off by saying I’m sorry. I was immature about the way I went things and I should of just tried to talk to her about it because she’s my sister and I love her. The entire time I’m saying all this she’s looking at me like I’m the most disgusting person on the planet. I finally stop and ask if everything is okay. Honestly I don’t even remember what she said. It’s fucking cliche but it’s literally all a blur. This always happens. Whatever she said is just not even a memory. Whenever I’m in conflict of any kind I can’t remember what was said. My body like shuts down. I can barely hear my own thoughts. My vision has blurred in and out before. Lately when I’m panicking I can’t hear anything. It’s scary. I don’t know if these are symptoms. I got diagnosed with PTSD and haven’t been back to the doctor since. It’s fucking terrifying. 

I remember what I said before I walked out of the restaurant. Something shitty about her creepy ass boyfriend? (I only feel this way about him because he tried to fuck me when I was 16 and he was 20. She knew this. Is now living with him) 

I just stood at the back of the restaurant and trembled. I called my husband and just balled and asked him to pick me up. Felt like 5 minutes had passed but it’d been 20.  My mom texted me my niece was upset so I went back in because I honestly hate that she even witnessed this disfunction.  

I don’t even know anymore. I just miss my family, but I hate them. I’ve had so many traumatic experiences in my life and almost all of them (including being molested) were caused by FAMILY. It fucks with me. I was raised to believe the most important people were family but at the same time they caused me the most pain. And continue to do so."

5d516fc44e371300160058dd	1469_ptsd	"Suffering Suffering, Losing My Twin Brother TLDR: Fill your well of sorrow with natural, wholesome joys.

This story is tragic, and I’m omitting personal details for a lot of reasons, but my experience is, in sharing my story, that others have found solace. Last summer, after a family event/argument led to domestic violence at home, I decided to move out of the house, where I was living with my twin brother. He had suffered from depression for most of his life, but towards the end, he became increasingly violent and manic. I was scared, and confused, and did what I thought was best for me and my partner at the time, and moved down the street to a new apt. The next day, after working, and not hearing from him, I started to get a sick feeling in my stomach. I ignored it for a few hours, drinking water and laying down, but the sick feeling grew into something else that I can’t describe. I’m sure you’ve heard stories of twins sensing each other, especially in times of distress. It’s rare, but I’m telling you, that shit is very real. So I walked over to our house, and he didn’t answer the door. It was a Tuesday night. He was 32. We were 32.

My actual experience is something too horrible and sad to describe in detail, but I did find him, and I’m the one who went in, and raised him up, and took him off of that rope. That tangible, physical experience, mixed with the tragedy of losing my twin brother, my best friend, who I spent my entire childhood with, has left me deeply traumatized. There’s an element to it that took part of my identity itself, as a twin, I’m now now longer part of a set. I’m half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How do I continue to be a twin without my match? Is a set still a set, once you apply subtraction? Am I still a twin now that he is gone?

My trauma experience is a nightmare, literally. My dreams manifest things I don’t even want to go into, and I’ve never been so aware of how many times suicide is mentioned in films, television, even comedy. It’s everywhere, and the suicide rates among young people are at unprecedented levels. My triggers induce a deep breath in me, at the mention of the word, or image, or a roped off front yard, Dad attempting to make the grass grow. Or a bread tie. Or a dog collar. It’s weird how things manifest like that. Unfortunately the mystery leaves me vulnerable to crying episodes in public, or leaving social gatherings early, and unannounced. I attempted to continue to suck it up, and be social, but my loss made me nervous, confused, empty. It left me empty. But, like the dry chalice might be considered to be empty, perhaps the purpose of the chalice, is to be filled. And so it flows into me...

It taught me to see truth a little clearer, but this has been hard. Truth requires self reflection first, self truth, whatever that means to you. I had to look hard at myself in order to deal with my grief and my guilt, and I know I’ll struggle to understand these issues for the rest of my life. I’ve been writing and reading about suicide, bipolar disorder (which he had), consciousness, empathy, truth, friendships, spirituality, and sorrow to try to process all of this. 

I never could have imagined being in this place, on this island. At first, many were supportive, but slowly I became more and more isolated, feeling like no one possibly could understand what I was going through. I slowly lost most of the people in my life, not because they didn’t care, but because they didn’t have the capacity to show it, they just didn’t know how. Who could blame them? I was confrontational, angry, sad, confused, and hoping someone was going to make it better for me. But it wasn’t about anyone else, if I was going to ever feel good again, it was going to be ME who made that happen. It’s amazing how everything can turn on a dime, and never return. It’s like, when he died, he took this..  thing... from me. What it is, I can’t name, but it’s gone for sure, and I’m pretty sure it’s not coming back. So what do I do with it, this emptiness? I walk with it. Literally. I walk and walk the trails on this island all day. It’s winter now, so it’s much colder, and my walks are filled with less pauses, but I persist. 

I’m in therapy, sometimes several times a week. I do not consume alcohol or hard drugs. I use particular psychedelics with a therapeutic intent, and have experienced profound revelations that have been helpful in moving my mind in a more conscious and positive direction. I take natural herbal supplements for energy and mood balancing, but I find that exercising in a natural environment is the best thing for me therapeutically. I’m lucky to be young enough to be so mobile. 

I’ve slowly shed all social media, FB, IG, etc, because I found it to contribute to my anxiety, my isolation, and resentment. I was constantly trying to openly share, self examine, and had hopes that others would reciprocate. But people don’t really want to do that. It’s super uncomfortable, and most would rather be distracted by the game, or their phone, or a drink. Finally, after a point in which I felt like what I was saying fell on deaf ears, I decided to no longer share with those who couldn’t hear it anymore. My therapist brought to mind the biblical concept “cast ye your pearls before swine”.  Of course I’m not saying my words are gospel, and in fact, I offer no advice to anyone, this is all purely my experience and expression. 

In fact, I’m in distress a lot, and I’m not saying that any of this made me a “better person”, I’m saying it made me wake the fuck up to myself, and what I was doing. Things don’t get easier, they just get different. Tragedy sometime can birth strength, but often times, tragic events do not make people better, stronger, or more aware, in fact it often makes us more disconnected, more isolated, feeling like we’re unique, and our pain is unique. Victims of trauma can’t be put into order in a filing cabinet, there’s no sense to be made of it. Some are resentful of those thriving, saying “that’s not my experience”. Of course it isn’t. It’s just yours. And this is just mine. And although my situation and personality are unique, I find my pain isn’t. The whole world is suffering suffering. My pain might just disappear, like a drop becomes the ocean, in the great vastness of collective consciousness, if I can release myself of the burden through empathy. Might any of us be strong enough to let the ocean completely envelop us? 

So it’s been a few weeks now since I’ve been free from Instagram and Facebook, and my urge to check a screen, my addiction to check in on these carefully manicured presentations of digital life, has faded. Leaving me again, more room to be filled with the good things I enjoy in life. Playing my guitar, and reading Melville in the bathtub, meditating outside, walking the sandy trails with the rabbits, listening to my favorite records, and most importantly, spending time with my loving and compassionate partner, who is the most selfless, understanding soul in my whole world. Without love, I would have perished along with my brother, but it’s love that kept me alive, and keeps me going. If I can learn to love myself truly, I know I’ll survive. 

I hope to someday find a way to have a PTSD service dog, although it seems unlikely, due to the cost of training one properly (about $20K). I absolutely love dogs, and I think about adopting one frequently, but again, it’s so hard for me to initiate important things, I can’t even imagine starting this process. A good friend of mine has a couple hounds who love me, and make me super happy, so sometimes, when I’m really down, I just go lay on the floor over at his house, and let the dogs go to town licking me and climbing all over me. It’s so sensational and wonderful, I smile just writing about it. A pure, simple, wholesome joy. 

I’m not past the pain, I’m just finding out better ways in which to navigate it. Some days, the seas are choppy, but at least the sails are full. The shores of the seas of my mental landscape, are lined by a great, “mental forest”. My twin brother was a great tree in my forest, and hard he fell, but that break in the canopy has given my forest new growth. Exotic species sprout from the sunlit patch spontaneously, and they invite me in, and we become one, and I enjoy the sun with them while I can. 

Are you in pain? I already love you."

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.

This is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):

A couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.

Then, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to ""listen to her point of view because she had listened to me."" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our ""conversation."" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.

At some point in this ""conversation"" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say ""No"" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said ""nice talking to you guys."" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.

In the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way ""there"".  

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole ""me"" in ways I have never experienced before. In any case, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support anyone might be able to offer."

I ended up cowarding out numerous times but now we're actually getting into it and attempting to work through it. Logically, I know that my abuser (ex gf) will not come back and I will never see her again and know that what happened, unfortunately happened, but it is not happening /now/. Even though I know this, it doesn't help.

I cannot physically speak about it. No matter how long I sit there going through the events in my head -- I can never speak about it. Writing is fine. But I cannot speak like something is holding my mouth shut. This is causing some issues with getting things out there for therapy...

[Some background: I was raped numerous times, have gotten blackout drunk to the point I couldn't move and just lay there to try and be okay with the sexual advances, guilted, emotionally and mentally abused, manipulated, was made into the abuser somehow, etc.
This happened right after high school with an older woman (I am FTM) around 4 to 5 years ago now. I still have nightmares about being raped again or her coming back. I cannot go to some places without a panic attack happening or being extremely uncomfortable. I cannot say her name.]

When bringing it up or talking about it, I disassociate intensely and just forget what I say, forget what happened, and don't remember what happened in therapy once I come back.

I know it's dangerous but we got to protect our neighbors and loved ones. About a month ago I was in Nashville when the tornadoes happened and saw first hand of the damage. I was there for 2 weeks after school helping . 

Last night I was driving off the clock and was right infront of a roll over crash . Girl ran a red light and guy had the right away. He flipped 3 times and watching it was like out of a movie. I ran up with a tryna kit I keep in the car and he was stuck in the truck. I had to break through his windshield to get him out . 

After 2 minutes I got in and pulled him out . He had glass in his face and blood was Everywhere. Looking at him I realized I went to school with him and he was my teachers kid. I layed him down and looked for DNR signs (do not resuscitate) and he didn't have any so I proceeded to begin CPR. He woke up to tell me to call his dad and as I called the EMT came in to get him.  .

He did not make it. The lady was under the influence. I feel so ashamed when I was in the class and the teacher wasn't there . I cried in class and feel guilty that I couldn't save him . Hunter I'm so sorry buddy.

My mom committed suicide. Do not pity her. She did this specifically to screw with me, that's how vindictive she was after years of physical and then more years after that of emotional and verbal abuse. I took it and did it proudly because it protected my little brother and I would do it again 50 times over. When my mom went absolutely insane a couple years before her death, I took care of everything, she was in jail, I visited her I would say every week except missing when I was too sick with migraines to drive or with bad roads. Anytime I missed I could expect a letter about how much she hated me. After she was divorced I stored all her things in the basement. I let her have unlimited access, she stole from me. She liked to torture me over suicide with multiple failed attempts and asking if I had her stepladder only to after me giving it to her have her text me about how she was about to kill herself, knowing I would be there because it was my duty. Her last day alive, she asked for access to her things, said that was fine but I was at work so it would probably have to wait for the weekend, she proceeded to tell me how awful a daughter I was, deserving of hell, how much she hated me etc. I told her (finally) to get over herself, she hung herself that night while I was searching for her. 


After, I thought I had to be the matriarch. I had to be strong for everyone, including my brother. So at 22 I planned my first funeral 7 days after my 22nd birthday and 7 days before Christmas. While everyone was shopping for gifts I was shopping for an appropriate turtle neck to cover signs of her death. I hated her more than I thought I could hate anyone and it hurt. It still hurts but 5 years later Im thankful I dont have an abuser anymore. Im working on being ok with being happy she is dead, that she doesnt deserve anything just for the title of ""mom"" and that I dont have to keep her crap or her ashes out of duty. I owe her nothing. 


You know what, tonight Im going to go get some of her favorite tequila, empty it any way I want, because I am not her and I dont hurt people when I drink and throw some ashes in there.

663ed306e45b308e3a7b1f8d	2184_ptsd	"15 years ago today, and it feels like it could genuinely happen again at any moment TW home invasion. TW gun violence.

&amp;#x200B;

Today it is 15 years since the event my family called The Incident. When I was 16, we went through a home-invasion in the middle of the night, in which I and my parents were shot. My parents and brother were also beaten. Though we all survived (by mere heartbeats, and with some permanent injuries), the level of violence and disregard for human life we experienced is grotesque.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in South Africa. Today, I board with my parents because they need the financial support, and because I frankly don't think it is safe to leave them alone in the old house. Yes, we still live in the same place. This time of the year is always the worst. July (midwinter here) gets freezing cold, just like that night I spent lying on the concrete in a pool of my own frigid blood, convinced that I was dying. We cannot go to bed until at least after midnight. We listen for the slightest sounds and stare out of the windows at shadows in the blackness.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are well into their 70s, and my father was disabled by the attack. They are struggling to live on a puny pension  (equivalent to about $70 a month) and my rent. I cannot get them to a safer place. I feel trapped here, playing the one younger stronger man in the household whose presence can hopefully deter an attack.

&amp;#x200B;

The usual July crime-wave is sweeping our area again. Yesterday a next-door-neighbour's house was broken into and ransacked. There is a small minority of people in this country who want White people dead. A month ago a young couple was shot to death in cold blood in a racist attack a couple of blocks away from me when their car ran out of fuel. They were executed, and the car was torched. These incidents constantly remind us of the hatred we tasted on that night. My nightmares of being shot are increasing in frequency, and last night I dreamt a man was slicing into my chest from all angles with a knife, in exactly the place where I was operated on after being shot. It seems at any moment it could all happen again."

hi, im 14 y/o and ive just realised my sister's boyfriend has been grooming me. ive talked to some people on r/SuicideWatch and r/survivorsofabuse and they were all very kind and helpful and i appreciate the time they took to warn me, a lot.

long story short, I met my sister's boyfriend when i was about 10-11. hes probably 30 right now and my sister is turning 30 soon. he has been touching me inappropriately for a long time now and it was until recently that i figured out this was wrong. he seemed like such a cool and nice guy to whom i could talk about videogames and tv shows with.

will this leave a permanent mark on me? i don't want to develop ptsd, i want to live a normal life. a few years ago when i started researching more about mental health and i came across ptsd it seemed like such a serious thing to me, which i guess it is, but i never thought id get to the point of thinking im at risk. i understand you guys can't diagnose me and im ok with that. i just want to compare my experiences to someone who has gone through the same things.

somehow this is all my fault. i did this to myself. i think it was like 2 years ago when i told him the tv in my living room had some porn channels in it. he didn't believe me so he started searching for them until he found one. we ended up watching porn together, another time i woke up before him and saw him stroking himself (he probably thought i was asleep), today he asked me if id wear lingerie after touching me on my thighs, waist and resting his head on my shoulder while playing a sexual hentai videogame. i can't help but think im the cause of this. im a teen, sexual thoughts do cross my mind but for some reason i think im the one who kickstarted the situation im in for even daring to think about anything sexual. ive never been so ashamed of myself.

can i live a normal life after this? i feel like im overreacting to this even though ive been told my reaction is perfectly normal. i wish i could forget all of this. i don't even feel like a normal person anymore, everything feels like a bad dream that im going to wake up from any minute now, the world doesn't even look real."

#[TW: Physical injury of sexual organs, medical negligence, suicide]

Look in my post history for more details (on /r/suicidewatch), but the basic gist is that I had surgery a few months ago, and the surgeon managed to amputate my sexual organ. I'm being vague here with vocabulary because I'm intersex and my anatomy is unusual, but I'm a guy and still have a penis, but it is not the source of my sexual sensation. The organ that was amputated was.

I previously had issues with trauma, but it was all the kind that was easy to dismiss as not being severe enough for PTSD. This is on a whole new level, and I'm seriously struggling with functioning day to day. The only way I'm able to is to shut everything related to this event out of my mind. I feel like I'm swatting flies in a dump. I'm completely numb most of the time, because allowing any emotion in opens the floodgates to the horror and pain of what happened to me, and it's just absolutely unbearable.

I'm struggling to see how I can live with this, or how it can ever get any better. I've lost sexual function, and have this constant physically painful and uncomfortable reminder on my body of the trauma that was done to me.

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

Even someone lightly tickling my arm or something can cause what feels like a slight electric shock and then quickly turns into the feeling that my entire body is burning. It's so unpleasant and literally makes me want to claw my skin off. I know things like alcohol and xanax help it go away, but I don't wanna rely on either of those for obvious reasons.

663ed306e45b308e3a7b1f8d	2480_ptsd	"NSFW: Diagnosed with PTSD. Root trauma from five years ago. I had a group of friends since 2004, and remained friends with them up until 2014 when I finally cut communications with them. They were a very toxic group of racist, sexist, and narcissistic people. The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. 

1. The ""leader"" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like ""You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?"". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending ""laugh"" like ""Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha."" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.
2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.
3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.
4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like ""go kill yourself no one loves you""
5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.
6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life. He was the only one I kept in more recent contact, but I noticed some of his personality traits were very similar to the group.  He would do the same mocking laugh the leader did, the same type of criticism that the leader's favorite and the white supremecist did. And at a recent party, I found out he was trying to hit on girlfriends of my friends, and made a lot of people uncomfortable. After realizing all this, I realized he is just as bad as that old group and I cut him off.

Over 5 years have passed since then, and I still think about this. I feel like I wasted so much of my potential and energy during college and feel this is part of why I'm struggling so much in the present. I think hanging out with the ""best friend"" in recent years triggered it even more, and I've been stuck in a rut for nearly a year since then.

I don't know how to find peace with this."	[]	"[{'start': 6, 'end': 25, 'span': 'Diagnosed with PTSD', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1940, 'end': 1974, 'span': 'go kill yourself no one loves you""', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

_____________________________

Got the diagnosis just two days ago. Got medication and appointments to therapy or whatever. I'm already dealing with nerve damage in my spine and going to have surgery for the third time in a few weeks - while that fucking sucks it got skyrocketed by this new plot twist. Really, really struggling.

It's been years, maybe 15 years since my NCO shot himself. My search team found him. Great dude. A real brotherly authority figure. Trying to not think too much about that.

I never thought that that could have been the reason for my decline after leaving the military. Depression, isolation, numbness, severe dissociation, feelings of dread and doom (which I didn't know until very recently is anxiety), can't stand a certain smell of forest etc, constantly think ""If he killed himself being the fucking champion he was. What chance do I have?"", self harmed for a year after I left the army which concluded in a suicide attempt which left a huge scare over my chest which also reminds me. 

Never thought anything about it, I could not see my own problems and when I did I didn't link it to PTSD as ""I haven't experienced anything traumatic"". Just pushing anything related to that away subconsciously. The psychologist said that they called it ""the evading illness"" internally as it's extremely common to just block it all and say that you are fine.

Well, you people know all that. 

I don't know. I just had to write something about it that says ""hey this happened"" to myself. Between this and the surgery I'm struggling to find the will to go on. All I see before me is a mountain I don't have the strength to climb. 

I got homework to ready as much as I can about PTSD but so far I've been avoiding it and just shitpost on reddit instead. I remember he asked if there was anything I wanted to do, like a goal, I could not answer because I don't get joy from anything - but today I realized what I wanted. I want to stop.

No real reason to post this. I'm going to anyway, not even on a throwaway because this is real and happening no matter what I think."

Almost nobody around me that's been in less than 6 years has seen anything remotely close to combat, and neither have I.

You have to not be in the position to do anything sinful at all even though if you had the chance to sin you would. That makes the bible completely retarded and judgement also if god does not take this into consideration. Like sending some fat, one eyed incel to heaven for an eternity of happiness only because he wasn't able to act out on having sex, perhaps he also wanted to kill people like hitler but couldn't due to not being in his position?

I'm in Mountain Rescue, and over the past two years I've had missions with nothing but fatalities. The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury. None the less, it was traumatic and recently I started getting anxious and irritable.

Today I got a mission call out for a missing 7 year old girl who went missing at their families camping vacation last night. Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out ""fuck yes"" after I heard on the radio ""we've made contact!"". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. 

I'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help. However in the end, I feel like I was given a gift, and a chance to start over and keep my passion for helping others going. I know that many of you on here are in a rut or hole and feel like you cant get out, but please, don't give up. You never know when you might get your chance to rebuild like I did today.

663ed306e45b308e3a7b1f8d	1401_ptsd	"I think I have an episode of PTSD. Help is appreciated. Hello.
I live in a very unsafe country. I grew accustomed somehow to the hazardous risk of my daily life (due to rampant deliquency) and fortunately, due to my residence in an upscale neighborhood, I haven't been really that exposed to the real face of danger.
Nonetheless, tonight, while scrolling down the timeline on Twitter, I came across this gory video of a young man (way too young, a teenager) been brutally beheaded after what looks like a horribly agonizing execution.
It seems it was the by-product of mafia wars but it occured in my home country, fortunately, far away from the capitol city.
However, the video shocked me so much that I can't really think of other things now. I'm really paranoid now that someone could break into my house and subject me to such a dreadful death. I'm paranoid about the domestic employee (from a poor side of the city) to gang up with others to assault on me in order to steal from me or something like that. It got to the point that I felt like throwing up at least a good half an hour after watching the video.

I have never considered myself sensitive to this kind of material. Actually I had watched several of them in the past but this one really hit home. 

I believe the paranoid thoughts (which I never had) and feeling unsafe for my dog and myself (due to a good part of the population being deprived of proper food and healthcare) are an episode of PTSD.

I want to thank all of the police officers, especially those fighting organized-crime for the daunting risk they take on our behalf. I believe that for the first time ever I understand how they expose their relatives and families and I really want to express my gratitude.

I know I can’t *technically* have PTSD unless you’re still displaying symptoms 1 month post-trauma, but  having a really hard time coping with it all. I know I can’t think about all the ‘what if’s’ but it’s so fucking hard not to..

My life was changed the morning of Wednesday April 10th, 2019. I am not the same person I was prior to the explosion, and it’s so fucking sad/scary/idek how to really describe it.. I was kind of a mess of a person before everything happened. Super fucking anxious and the weirdest ambivert. I avoided eye contact and got spooked easily and idk man people just make me nervous and it gets even worse in social settings. I’ve been on SSRIs for years and have seen multiple therapists and have honestly just been dealing with the highs and lows of mental illness. I’m just a research technician in an academic lab, enjoy my quiet work days and just keep to myself, while helping my bosses and post-docs with whatever’s going on that week. 

I’ll try to keep it short, but there was a natural gas explosion directly across the street from our vivarium right after my boss and I finished an experiment. As soon as he opened the door, jokingly said ‘Hmm it smells like gas. Best walk briskly so we don’t get blown up!’ I saw the construction workers across the street crowded around where I occasionally park when running late. I have a HORRIBLE sense of smell, so I was taking in the air, trying to remember what natural gas smelled like. Continuing down the sidewalk, I remember saying, ‘good thing you’re here because you know I can’t smell, I wouldn’t have had a clue!’ 

There were 2 seconds left on the crosswalk; knowing he’s a stickler with the rules I quickly paused as I watched my boss step into the road, speed walking through the white lines of the intersection. As soon as we crossed the street.. BOOM!!! 

It was almost an out of body experience, the whole thing really. The shock wave from the explosion pushed us down the sidewalk, I felt it go through my body and down the sidewalk in front of me. All of the windows outside the building next to us instantaneously shattered, raining down on us and into our eyes.. I remember looking at my boss as he screamed at me to run. 

My ears.. it was like a tornado had just ripped through my head.. then then the pounding and ringing started. I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn’t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming ‘WHAT THE FUCK’ at each other out of shock.

People starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating ‘don’t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.’ I remember the confused look on their faces..

It’s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I’m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me. If we had finished our experiment a minute later, or stayed at the crosswalk, or happened to walk at a slower pace.. it’s so fucking terrifying. I’m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. 

Begging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they’re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it’s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...

It’s only been 4 days, but it feels like it’s been an eternity. I didn’t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it’s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...

I do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. 


But at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen? It’s all so surreal and yes I’m extremely thankful to be alive, but the survivors guilt immediately crept in. I’m a trained BLS instructor, and I just ran.. I understand there was nothing I could do to save anyone, but I still feel so much guilt and shame.. 

I just needed to get it all out. Advice on moving forward is welcome/appreciated.

When we came to the path of the second bridge one grabbed my friend who I had overtook and went to stab him him the back. I tackled the man and my friends got away, however I was then cornered into a grassy clearing and questioned on where I was from, told they were going to drag me to the dark and kill me, and I resisted their attempts to drag me. I was thrown back onto a construction fence, the only thing separating me from the water. Before I know it I was set upon, seeing strobe light like vision as my eyes were being punched repeatedly, my legs were brown from the dirt and being kicked relentlessly, and I was dodging and diving, swinging, trying to fend for myself, when I see one run up and plant a Stanley blade into my head, just above my eyebrow. It got stuck as the assault continued and part of my cheek was cut off with a much larger knife in an attempt to slice my eye out, they talked about finishing me and argued over who should have the knife and before I know it one charged aiming for my neck. I managed to grab his wrists and twist the hand but he put it through the skin in-between my thumb and index finger. I twisted his hand the whole way and felt a crack and he fell back causing his friends to look away. I dove to go over the barrier and was sliced down the entirety of my back and ran blacking in and out, pulled the knife out my head and collapsed in my own blood. When I awoke I walked myself to the hospital, got patched up, and tried to carry on. I was 17 at the time (now 18), and for a week or two I was fine. Then came the episodes. I would teleport back to that dockyard on repeat screaming and tangling my bedsheets, put my drink down in a bar and come around over a mile away as I'd just freaked out and ran and ran, with little to no memory of these episodes. I was and am a paranoid mess, and my gentle nature has become anxious and aggressive. I can't remember if I've clocked in at work, what I learn in classes, what I ate for breakfast, and when I did go on medication was so drowsy and whacked out my mind I couldn't learn either way. I fell asleep in work, classes, I stopped taking them. I now am back to essentially square one, and have already savaged one of my attackers when I seen him in broad daylight. I moved out in November of last year to hide all this from my family, and have deadbolts on my door to lock myself away if I feel an episode coming on, and it is hell. Any advice?

For about 2 years I could hardly get into a car without panicing. However, 9 years later, I have no problem getting into a car however I cannot fathom driving. Bad drivers still give me scares, but thats normal I'm sure. Most of my anxiety now comes from lack of self-confidence in driving, and imagining things like people running stop signs (someone ran a stop sign and hit me going 50 over the speed limit) at intersections. The inability to drive has deeply impacted my life and I would really like to get over the overwhelming anxiety that has limited me, so any advice or suggestions are welcome. For what its worth, anxiety has impacted me greatly in other aspects of life but this specific problem is rooted in a tramautic event.

.

(Idk whether I actually am gaslighting myself but important to include that Tw regardless)

.

.

.

The situation I'm in - I'm 21, at university, and I'm honestly shocked at how shitty lots of my peers can be to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

There's bullying and have been instances of public shaming which I believe fall under the label of ""emotional abuse"". I know a couple who I think are in an abusive relationship (the woman abusing the man), and I believe certain sentiments within my community normalise female-on-male abuse. I believe that one of my past romantic relationships has been emotionally abusive, I believe that as a kid I was sometimes abused by my Dad, I believe that when I was 18 men tried to manipulate me into sex. I believe that I've abused myself. I believe that I was sexually assaulted in my first year of university..... and then again in my second year..... and then again in my third. I believe that a member of staff sexually harassed me. I believe that in my environment, abuse and inappropriate behaviour between staff and students are normalised. I believe that on my first week there, someone spiked my drink. I believe I faced harassment from other students when I held a student politics position. I believe my housemate emotionally lashed out at me and maybe thought about me in an abusive way. I believe I have a friend who's emotionally abused me (the same one that I think abuses her boyfriend), and that her best friend enabled it.

&amp;#x200B;

And this just leads me to ask myself - am I the problem???

&amp;#x200B;

I think in some ways I have been unlucky - for whatever reason, I've experienced more mistreatment than average. I think I (wittingly and unwittingly) can put myself in vulnerable situations - like with the student political position, I knew I'd feel very anxious about it and take people's criticisms to heart, but I did it anyway partly cos I felt I'd have to, and partly cos I thought I'd do a good job. And then with my friend who I think abused me, I guess I did see the red flags and (for whatever reason) chose to ignore them, because I thought I could control/handle it. Same with the abusive ex coming to think of it. So maybe it's that I don't avoid these situations enough?? (Could my trauma have desensitised me to certain warning signs?)

&amp;#x200B;

But then part of me also thinks, is it about how I'm interpreting situations?

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 17 I went through a highly traumatic series of events, and I was only able to recover by recognising and understanding abuse. I'd experienced things like gaslighting, I became aware of common misconceptions people have - I guess I had to learn about abuse / healthy relationships on a logical level, before going on to experience them, because my trauma had been so bad and completely messed up the way I viewed relationships? So I had to reform my ideas step by step using logic/principles?

&amp;#x200B;

So there's two ways of looking at this - awareness and projection.

&amp;#x200B;

It's definitely true that I see abuse where others don't. Also I don't \*always\* mean it as such a seriously bad thing - I mean obviously it's unacceptable, does have a negative impact, and needs to be stopped. But I don't think ""traumatic"" or ""super emotionally damaging"" are prerequisites (though they obviously often come with it) - I think it's just a significant violation of someone's boundaries in a way that doesn't have a reasonable explanation, accompanied by gaslighting or denial (though gaslighting doesn't need to be there when it's severe). So say with my ex - I feel like the emotional manipulation was traumatic, but the specific individual instances of sexual abuse (and the gaslighting that came with those) wasn't traumatic and didn't need to be to ""count"" as abusive?

I can think of someone or a situation as ""abusive"" without thinking it defines them as a person, they'd act like that in all contexts, or that they were consciously meaning to do harm. Whereas I think a lot of people my age use it to describe only very serious / extreme behaviour - and people who they think are ""bad"". They're reluctant to identify abuse in those they like / love / are able to empathise with.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it that they're 21, and in denial, and experiencing all the rationalisations and justifications that abused people &amp; witnesses typically do? Is it that a lot of people receive a certain level of abuse, but never \*need\* to come to terms with it, because it doesn't escalate, and it never impacts then \*that much\*? Is it that they are significantly impacted, and some of them will never come to terms with it (i.e. permanently impacted), but most people will learn and see recognising destructive behaviour (for what it is) as a process they went through in their 20s?

&amp;#x200B;

Or is it that I'm projecting? I went through a really horrible experience when I was 17. My formative examples of mistreatment are labuse, so is it hard for me to see any type of mistreatment as non-abusive? Black and white approach?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not as if I consider all my friends to be abusive - I have many friends who I don't consider to be abusive. Some of them have mistreated me, but because they've apologised or I've clearly seen it was their fault, I haven't really interpreted it as abusive? And there have been times I've been hurt or disappointed in the past in ways which I consider non-abusive (thinking about it though, instances of abuse do seem to heavily outweigh instances of non-abusive harm when I think about my life experiences).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally not a fan of ""everyone else is the problem"", but to me, my interpretations of each experience makes sense, and I've often thought about it a lot? Is it just that I reflect more on things??

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if I'm just sensitive? Do I feel abused by others so easily bc I'm so impacted by them?

&amp;#x200B;

5c74f546df19050016a5fdb7	1524_ptsd	"PTSD from forced sex work A bit of background here - I (29 F) was heavily involved in the drug scene back in my early twenties. Prior to that, in high school, I was very promiscuous (possibly as a result of taking medication meant for depression while actually being bipolar, perhaps sending me into a mania).

In my drug phase, there were lots of times I’d have sex for drugs. Sometimes I wouldn’t expect it - thinking that I could just pay the guy for my drugs like a normal transaction, but they ended up not wanting the money and I’d give in. 

the climax of it all happened when I was desperately looking for a fix and this guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help. I got in the car (I know, stupid as hell) and he ended up getting me a handful of pills. I didn’t know what they were, but I downed all of them. I passed out and then when I woke up, we were hundreds of miles away from where we originally met and he proceeds to explain to me that I’m “going to be working for him now”. He was a pimp. 

I spent the next few weeks in that situation - he took my cell phone, kept me drugged up, woke me up at 8am everyday to start working until the late hours of night. He’d yell at me if I had any bruises from someone being too rough with me. 

I had tried to kill my self then, but it didn’t work and woke up to him screaming at me about it.

The only way I was able to contact anyone was when I had developed an infection in my arm from IV drug use and he finally (after days of this) agreed to take me to the ER. I called my family from there and thankfully he agreed to just drop me off at the airport where they would pick me up.

I’ve talked about this many times in counseling, but it’s always been like I was talking about the weather. No emotion behind it, just nonchalantly telling the story.  

It wasn’t until very recently that I thought about the whole situation and realized that I had been kidnapped. That yes, I was looking for drugs and that was bad, but I was kidnapped and taken captive and used.

Since this realization, I’ve been having flashbacks, especially during sex. And having sex is a whole different can of worms for me - lots of times, my body doesn’t “feel” anything. It’s like I’m still in prostitution mode, where I act like I’m enjoying it but really can’t wait for it to be over. The only way I can get off is by imagining my partner having sex with other people - it’s like I can’t allow myself and my own body to experience pleasure. Imagining things like that make me feel like a creep and it takes
something that’s supposed to be intimate and skews it into this fucked up thing.


Last night, I felt it came to a head. I was having sex with my boyfriend and just began having flashbacks of my time as a prostitute - seeing images of guys putting money on the table, disassociating from my body and I then felt this sensation of such anger that I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted to bit my boyfriend across the face, scratch him, grab his face hard. I feel so terrible about it. I started crying and then of course that ruined the moment and the poor guy had no idea what was going through my head.

He knows some of what I’ve been through, but there’s so much he doesn’t know and doesn’t want to know. I don’t blame him. 


I want to enjoy sex again. I’m seeing a therapist and am on medication for bipolar, but this shit just haunts me. I can’t tell if I actually enjoy sex or just default to prostitute mode where i make all the sounds and motions of enjoying something, like I’m acting and playing the part. 

Does anyone else have similar stories that they can offer advice about? I’m in such a low spot. I’ve been contemplating suicide for feeling like such a burden.

They do inspections where I am and inspections aren't something I can get around. They bang on the door super loud and it sends me into a panic attack. My room use to be like a safe place but now it feels like a coffin and its suffocating. I try to go out and I get such bad anxiety being around people. Heaven forbid I see someone who looks remotely like my attacker. But staying in my room I get flashbacks.

5c74f546df19050016a5fdb7	1583_ptsd	"PTSD from boyfriend of 5 years almost dying... It’s kind of hard for me to find anyone to talk to besides my therapist about this, because I don’t know if it’s the same feelings as when someone goes through this and their loved one actually does pass. 

A brief summary of what happened: The day after Thanksgiving I ended up convincing my boyfriend to go to the urgent care for a pain in his side that he’d been feeling for a few weeks but had gotten to the point where he was having pain with every breath he took. We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn’t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He’s not able to workout because he’s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. 

I was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.

I feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn’t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he’s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It’s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...

Not to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing. It’s just so much to deal with all at once and I just feel so alone like no one else can understand what I’m going through."

5c74f546df19050016a5fdb7	1684_ptsd	"A nightmare fueled week venting. Obvious NSFW or TW or whatever. Sexual abuse TRIGGER WARNING

Hello, I haven't used my Reddit for quite some time now and I've been having a crazy week filled with nightmares every night. So, instead of walking out of my room and speaking or texting my mom or someone who has a common past trauma thing... I post here while crying my face off alone in my bedroom trying to cry quietly so no one hears me. 

I close my eyes after sitting for twenty minutes saying to myself that I can't think of those things over and over. The moment my eyes shut I see a few scenes from my childhood. One of which surfaced after not showing it's face for quite a few years. I sat up horrified and had to refrain from screaming. I thought I had forgotten it after all this time. Nope. Of course not. I never forget that shit. 

Behind my eyelids I saw my brother digging up something fuzzy and lumpy from the ground in the forest right by my grandmother's house.
 I feel sick just typing this but here it goes. On the shovel there were bones and a larger lump came up and I saw the fur of an animal. I was an extremely gullible child who had followed my brother and it took me till seeing the fur to realize this is where we had buried our cat Smokey. A Siamese who I loved with all my heart and had to be put down because of a rare condition I was told was passed down from his mother. I don't know the truth but I'll just pray that's it. 

I immediately starting crying after the realizing it was my Smokey and ran crying to my mom after having my life threatened if I told. I don't even remember if I told her. That's sad. I hope I did. The movie behind my eyelids starts as fast as it started when I close my eyes for a second time. 

The instant it starts I see me and my brother hidden under my bunk. Me with my pants down cringing at something my eyes won't show me. I'm so thankful that is a blurred thing to see. In this scene I always remember my grandmother walking in the room and realizing we are under the bed together. I had prayed and prayed to a god I don't believe in that my grandmother would take him away from the same room and whoop his ass and cuff him but it was never spoken of... I don't even remember how old I was, my school counselor narrowed my trauma to starting age five. I guess she had talked to my mom over the phone about the apartment I described to her. Middle school was the last time anyone spoke of those things.

I am not the best at typing on this broken phone. I thought that typing here would somehow help me if I got my story, well a fraction of it, out there into the atmosphere.. this is only a snippet of the horrors I lived through while around my brother. My dad to this day tries to win him over and loves him so much and my mother has him under her wing at all times. No one talks about that shit. Everyone loves him so much while I sit here sleepless half the time over the torture I've lived. He probably sleeps soundly every night of his disgusting life. Having to wake up to my kids is the only reason I'm still here. Holy shit dude...."

He groomed me from a teenager mental health fourn and he was 18. He visited me on his way to a Europe vacation and gave me my first kiss, I wanted to wait to kiss and he just forced it. He wanted a BJ so bad but I said no and he was so mad. We saw a play and he was just grumpy and mean. I went to visit him in his state and I loved his family but he would demand BJs. He asked if he needed to get condoms but I said I didnt want to have sex. I was on my period too so I think its why he didnt do more to me. I always wanted to go to Sedona and Lowell Observatory and he took me there on our trip but he locked me in the hotel room, we never went to the observatory or even Lowell. He made me grind/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said ""but think about how id feel"" and pushed me down. He grinded into me and I felt himself kinda push in trough my underwear and I felt scared. I went home and we broke up a few months later after he moved to Germany and I just set my relationship as with someone else to get him to leave me cause I kept trying but hed make me feel bad ( I was 18 and dumb...) 

I only told my twin but never my mom. She would NEVER understand.  I had another abusive bf this year (23 years old) and he was VERY misogynist. Like an incel. He hid it and it came out later on. He knew of my PTSD and all his rape jokes made me freak out and cry. He said the last time we fooled around he would cover my mouth and ignore me saying no and I freaked out idk why hed say that and I left a few weeks later. 

I now am seeing a new guy, but hes 100% diff than anyone. We were bffs. Hes sensitive, kind, funny, sweet, very dorky and very loving in his heart. He feels like the boy me. He is very sexually intelligent and patient. After my trauma at 18 I decided I want to wait till marriage so I never ever have to have sex with someone who I wouldn't regret. After my incel ex I feel it even more the way he changed and warped. My current bf knows this he knows everything and he is fine with it. His last ex they never had sex for their whole 5 years and he said he has dated many virgins and waited till they were ready. All his close friends say he truly is a great man. Hes a unicorn haha. 

I really want to fool around with him more but I am very scared Ill freak out. I cant masturbate without him and I feel like a WHORE doing it alone cause of my past. I just want to be normal. I want to just have happy sexual experiences with my bf. I know he can give me them the way he is but Im scared ill make them bad. I just want to be normal. Therapy is so slow and its such few and far between where I make milestones in anything at all!! How does this go away?! I manage my OCD, my anxiety is improving but PTSD never goes away. I hate it. I want to cry. I was only 18 why did me make me do all that stuff. I didnt want too. I feel like a disguting slut I want to punch my legs till they are black and blue. I hate myself for what I let happen to me and the fear it makes me have. My partner gets concerned to trigger me, hes very slow and patient when we discuss sex. Being a virgin I ask him questions and he never laughs at me like other people do he just explains stuff kindly and sweetly. No pressure no meanness. I feel like a dirty mean bad person. I want to talk to him but hes also stressed at work today and I feel so mean. My therapist is on vacation cause of Jewish holidays :(  idk..

5c74f546df19050016a5fdb7	1598_ptsd	"Introductory post..kinda?//about my PTSD Hi guys. I’m new to this sub reddit.


I’m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. 
I totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn’t do anything. 
I had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn’t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don’t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.
I’m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can’t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can’t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. 
I also watched the worst accident I’ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I’d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn’t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn’t ok to drive. 
So.. yea. I don’t really know where I was going with this, I guess I’m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they’re doing better now. 
I don’t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can’t even do those things.
I’m trying so hard. I just feel like it’s pointless sometimes. 

Anyway if you read this super long post..
Thank you. It feels nice to finally be able to have a voice."	[]	[{'start': 136, 'end': 162, 'span': 'I got into a car accident.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

title kind of explains it all but here's my story. yesterday i was at pride for the first time ever. my parents aren't all that supportive of the LGBT community so it took me years to find the courage to go. we were one block over from the main event because we wanted to get food and suddenly a guy runs by and yells ""don't go that way"" but we don't see anything so we keep walking and suddenly a flood of people is running towards us and yelling ""RUN"" so we start running and we get caught in this stampede and there's people falling and tripping and suddenly i hear a loud noise and i've grown up around guns so i don't really scare easy but this sounded exactly like a gun shot and i've never run faster in my life and then we're ushered into this building and there's maybe fifty people crammed in and people including adults are crying and holding their kids, people are praying, people are calling their loved ones. i called my mom and had to tell her i loved her and that i was safe but i didn't know what was happening and to tell my dad too because he was on a plane to india and i din't even get to say goodbye to him because i left before he went to the airport and then my friend and i just kinda took charge because nobody else was and we didn't know what was going on. i have no regard for my personal safety so i ran outside to find a cop and all i hear is ""gun in custody, no dead, people injured"" so as i'm running back into the building a second wave of people starts running and i barely make it back into the building before getting trampled and there's even more people and two girls are having massive panic attacks and there was no cell service and the news wasn't updating on anything so we didn't have any information on what was happening and nobody would say anything and there were a bunch of cops outside but for an hour we were in a complete communications blackout and i thought there was a shooter and i was going to die. when i got home and i was in service i found out that there was a fight and somebody whipped out a gun and chaos ensued. i really didn't feel anything while it was happening. my hands weren't shaking at all and when i got home i couldn't even cry but today i was at the pool and walking in and outside there was chalk on the ground that said ""RUN"" and my stomach immediately dropped for no real reason and then inside there were people playing water polo and they missed the goal and the ball made the same sound i heard when i was running yesterday and after i left i got in my car and i just started crying for ten minutes. afterwards i was out with my friend and some kids ran past us and again my stomach just dropped and i was back in that moment. we saw a movie and this guy kept walking in and out of the theater and all i could think about was how there was nowhere to hide.

that's my story. i feel like i'm just overreacting because there wasn't actually a shooter and so many other people actually have lived through shootings so in comparison this was nothing. i just don't know how to feel about all of this. i'm alternating between feeling absolutely nothing, like now as i'm typing this, and complete anxiety and crying. i know i should talk to a therapist but there's none covered by insurance in my area and my old therapist was really expensive. i'll have access to a counselor for free in college but i don't know if i can live like this for the next two months if every loud noise or sound of people running makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry and with all of this shame because i feel like i shouldn't be this affected by something that wasn't really even a real threat in the end. i didn't know where else to go and i don't know what to do."

666295a878fb6e86805493d1	2494_ptsd	"Unresolved Childhood PTSD from a near-death experience Hi there,

So this might be a bit of lengthy ramble, but bear with me. As a kid I used to love horse riding, so so much. I went to a prestigious equestrian school twice a week and did everything from hacking, to showjumping, to novice dressage. I got decent enough that I was really comfortable in the saddle. I loved going cantering because of the thrill, and I had confidence dealing with horses that spooked or acted difficult.

However, one day when I was twelve I fell from horse during a showjumping event. It was a horse hadn't ridden much and wasn't used to its mannerisms. I later discovered I'd broken my coccyx (tailbone) and was in pain for weeks afterwards but because I immediately got back on the horse after the fall and continued to ride for bit, I wasn't too shaken up about it.

About a month later, my parents were looking into buying a horse for me and we thought we'd finally found a good beginner horse. The owners seemed to think this horse was a good match, however, upon riding the horse I discovered that it was extremely flighty. It didn't listen to me at all and would just bolt off in random directions at a full gallop no matter how hard I tried to pull it back. At this point, I started to panic. I didn't like feeling like I wasn't in control of the animal. Eventually it threw me off, hard. I was okay, but determined to see if I could control this horse, I got on again. This was a mistake. The second time it threw me off at a full gallop (around 60km/h) and I landed on my head. I had a bad concussion and couldn't see properly. I also had severe neckpain similar to a whiplash-type injury. I was also very very traumatised by what had happened. I felt paralysed by fear.

After recovering from my physical injuries, I attempted to resume riding lessons but this failed. I couldn't be atop a horse for more than five minutes without breaking down in tears. Every moment I spent on horseback was pure terror, even with sound horses I'd known for years. Nothing seemed to help. My instructor began to get very frustrated with me, and this made me hate myself even more. Eventually my mum sent me to therapy where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Though the therapy was useful and I found myself unwilling to get on a horse again. My experienced had permanently turned me off horses.

So now I'm in my twenties, and considering revisiting the possibility of riding in a controlled environment with very sound horses. Although I don't think I still have PTSD (in that I no longer have nightmares or flashbacks) I am still suffering from a kind of trauma that I wish to heal. On the one hand I'm terrified of getting on a horse again, on the other hand I don't think there's any other way to put this behind me. What should I do?

666295a878fb6e86805493d1	1526_counseling	I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. Divorce can be so disruptive in a child's life.I'd really need a lot more information about your situation before I'd feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions. There are so many variables, and not knowing the whole story, any advice could possibly make your situation worse.I do see some positives, though. One, you say you have a therapist. That's great! I hope you're able to talk to them about this soon. Still, they can't give you legal advice, and a lot of this situation may be dictated by the law. What your therapist can help with, though, is dealing with whatever situation you have to follow by law. If you can't change the situation, you at least need to learn how to cope with it better. Two, you're 17. When you're 18, you're legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place. Honestly, teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements. Since you didn't specify more on the situation, I have no idea what your specific situation is. Were your parents ever married? Are they separated or divorced? Was there ever a court hearing for custody? Not all couples have an official court order arrangement. All families are different, too. Was there abuse between your parents? Towards you by one of them? Does either of them have addiction issues, major health or mental health issues, or anything like that? You mentioned that you want to live with your mom, but didn't say why. Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom? Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one, or is there something else going on? This isn't a decision that should be placed entirely on you, and it also isn't a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input. But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you. Whatever you do, hang in there! 18 will be here before you know it. Focus on that. Freedom. College. Plan for your future that YOU control, and focus on making it the best it can be. Do not let the anxiety and depression cloud your thoughts and make you do something irreversible.

I just need to vent really. I have diagnosed PTSD from a medical trauma that (long story short) has resulted in me being terrified of hospitals/doctors offices/etc. I've been working to get over that with a therapist.

I know it's unlikely I'd get COVID-19. I know I'm probably fine. I know I could probably survive it. Other than my underlying medical history making me immunocompromised, I'm in the age range that has super low death rates of the virus. But despite that I'm panicking. 

I am shaking, can't focus, just crying in bed from fear. I had a nightmare last night for the first time in almost 6 months, I was doing so well. I don't even want to go to my therapists office for fear of interacting with someone sick. I KNOW I'm overreacting but the thought of getting sick and having to go to a hospital is terrifying to me. It's not the getting sick part I'm scared of - it's the going to the hospital. So because of that I'm making choices that are impacting my life - skipping work for example. I just can't get over the fear of leaving. 

I know it's irrational. I know it's stupid. I know I should go talk to my therapist. But the fear is just stopping me and I feel so stupid right now even saying that. How can I know these are irrational thoughts and yet still be so paralyzed by them at the same time?"

666295a878fb6e86805493d1	2475_ptsd	"Can PTSD develop due to seizures? Hello everyone. I’m sorry for the wall of text. I’d like to preface this by saying I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, nor have I experienced anything life-threatening, but at the time of the experience I couldn’t tell what was going on. I’ve just noticed huge changes in a lot of different aspects of my life recently, and I’m looking for answers; google searches gave me results about PTSD leading to seizures, which is the reverse of what I’m looking for. I’ve done lots of research into what I’ve been feeling and how I’ve been behaving, but I hit a roadblock here and so I’m helping you guys can advise me a bit.

About 3 months ago, I had two seizures in one night. A few weeks prior to that, I had one seizure, but that was nothing compared to the doubleheader from right before Christmas. The first one occurred right after I used the restroom late at night; I turned around after putting the toilet seat and lid down, and sort of blacked out visually while retaining semi-consciousness. I fell onto the side of the bathtub (luckily the curtains stayed up, haha), then slid onto the floor, completely out of control of anything. I was even making moaning noises and saying “no” repeatedly, but neither of those actions were voluntary. I was too tired to even move from the floor, and my right leg and right arm were hurting terribly, but I couldn’t tell you whether it was on account of the fall or muscles spasms. 

After what seemed like an eternity (but more likely around 5-15 minutes), I managed to get up and limp to my room next door to the bathroom, but no sooner had I closed the door than I collapsed halfway onto my bed frame and slid onto the floor again. This one is what I think the trauma stems from; I couldn’t see or hear anything, and all I could feel was as if I was being electrocuted (if you’ve ever used one of those machines that applies shock to a specific muscle, it was like that on maximum power throughout my whole body). I have no idea how long it lasted, I just know that I could feel my vocal chords crying out without actually hearing them. By the time I regained hearing, I was mumbling “turn it off” over and over again, and the whole thing seemed to end right as I finally clearly yelled, “please turn it off,” aside from the arm/leg pain, headache, and profound confusion.

Since that experience, I haven’t felt or acted like myself at all, and I was insistent on getting into the neurologist’s office as soon as possible so I could prevent myself from ever experiencing that again. I now live in extreme fear of having another seizure, and all motivation I had to do anything seems to have been completely derailed. I’m tired of being so scared to experience it again, and I’ve found myself constantly going off on people when there are no justifiable grounds to do so. I’m not trying to dodge responsibility, but my reactions to so many things don’t even feel like they’re my own, I just sort of engage autopilot until things get complicated and I’m left trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with me. I can give more specific examples if need be, but I’ve already typed a lot and I don’t want to clutter this post with unnecessary paragraphs. Like I said, I’m just looking for potential answers as to what could be wrong, so if I’m in the wrong place or you know somewhere better to ask about this, please let me know; thank you so much in advance

I feel pathetic because I’m 26 years old and even with friends in the car with me I’ll cry out in fear uncontrollably. Most of the time in the car I’m a little on edge but am fine, but when crossing intersections or if I feel another driver is acting recklessly near me I’ll get very upset. 
I have this one very weird thing happen to me when I am sitting at a red light. It happens sometimes but yesterday was the most severe, as I happened to get stopped on a red light at the same intersection where the accident was, it’s in a town over from where I live now and I avoid the area so I am not over there much.
Anyways so when I am sitting at the red light, I start to feel very woozy, and I start to feel like I’m leaving my body or losing control of my body. I can’t tell if I’m passing out or what exactly is happening but it’s frightening and I’m afraid I’ll lose consciousness. I’ll usually try to shake my head and kind of wake myself up or open a window, and by the time the light turns green and I can go again then it will pass and it will go away. Sometimes when I stop the car on red the episode will start where I feel like the car is still moving even though it’s not and I’ll press extra hard on the brake and realize I’m not actually moving, then the sickness/pass out feeling starts. Does this happen to anyone else? "	[]	[{'start': 11, 'end': 23, 'span': 'car accident', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. I don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I don't know if he's evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest. A good therapist can support you in these goals. I wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult. :)"	[]	"[{'start': 68, 'end': 250, 'span': ""It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you."", 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

In virtual reality exposure therapy, the person is immersed in a computer-created virtual environment. While initially developed for advanced game play, it was quickly realized that the technology could also be used therapeutically.  The first study with ten veterans demonstrated that this therapy was effective in symptom improvement in all participants. This success was considered so significant that after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York’s World Trade Center, burn victims suffering from PTSD were treated using virtual reality exposure techniques. The outcomes for this treatment situation was also extremely successful. 

To date, virtual reality exposure therapy for PTSD has primarily been used with Vietnam War veterans so the virtual setting includes such imagery as helicopters and jungles. Research has shown that this type of therapy helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in these veterans. A few subsequent studies conducted with small numbers of Iraq and Afghanistan War vets found that virtual reality based therapy was also helpful in reducing symptoms in these former soldiers. 

[This article](https://medium.com/swlh/the-only-way-out-is-through-using-virtual-reality-for-ptsd-in-veterans-a0a3a0b1b3db?source=friends_link&amp;sk=67afc5dbc04e6a71afec35e744d68eb1) discussed an amazing personal experience working on an inpatient PTSD unit at the VA Hospital in New Orleans.

5ca73fe6bcdcc2001291822d	1976_ptsd	"I want everyone's opinion on working in a bakery. Hello everyone. I've recently come home from the Air Force and have been going to the VA for a couple of months for generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder. I also struggled heavily with [possible trigger warning!](#s ""suicidal thoughts."") Recently my therapist diagnosed me with OCD and PTSD which has been an eye opener, seeing as to how I've been feeling like something else was up with me, but couldn't figure out what it was until she confirmed it for me. 

Since I've been home my wife and I have gotten married and moved into our first home together (we stayed with her parents for the first two months of me coming home). I had a job at a residential care facility, but I quit and decided to work on my health full time until I could handle this stuff better because it was a real struggle working and coping at the same time. But since I quit, it meant it was fully up to my wife to pay the bills and rent. We're managing (barely), but I feel selfish and I want to help. I've gotten better since the start of my treatment and I want to get back into the world to fully turn back to civilian life and learn more about how to live with what I have by getting more used to it. 

I looked into being a baker as a job. I feel comfortable working with food and cooking at home. It really helps me take my mind off of my struggles and put them into what I'm doing. Plus baking to me is relaxing and not to difficult of a job. I've found a bakery here where I live and have been thinking about contacting the owner about my situation and applying, but I'm unsure if that's the right way to go about it. I want to the owner to be understanding of my situation though and know what they're getting into hiring me. Not that I'm going to be a nuisance and have a lot of problems, but that I may need a break or two every once and awhile to collect my thoughts and catch my breathe, you know? 

I'm also going to talk to my therapist about this on Thursday during our next appointment, but until then I wanted to get this subreddits thoughts on it and if it sounds like a good idea, or if I should even go for it? Thank you all in advance for any input, and l hope you have a great rest of your day."	[{'start': 85, 'end': 108, 'span': 'home from the Air Force', 'annotation': 'uncertain'}]	[]

5ca73fe6bcdcc2001291822d	1538_ptsd	"(Potential trigger warning) My flashbacks are being triggered by public events at my college I was sexually assaulted and nearly killed a little over a year ago- it’s been 389 days, and I’ve survived it, and I am so proud of myself for it. (Was not on campus at the time)

Starting a few days ago, a spotlight was put on my college’s truly terrible handling of sexual assaults on campus, and people are very rightfully upset, because the school seriously and repeatedly fucked up, to the point where they could face legal repercussions. The thing is, the students here are very vocal about and frequently fairly united on their opinions on issues like this. So now I’ve been getting about five emails every day about ‘addressing campus sexual assault’ or whatever (my tone is dismissive because administration is just trying to minimize the problem without actually trying to solve it) and starting today, there’s a massive sit in in our union building, there are local news crews here to cover it, and there must be thousands of fliers everywhere on campus. It has been months since I was as triggered as I was today. I have had multiple panic attacks, flashbacks, and auditory hallucinations. I feel like I can’t even breathe when I’m not locked away in my room, but even there, I’m starting to feel like a caged animal. I don’t think the organizers of the sit in (the sit in is the reason for all the other things listed) realize how damaging this is to the very population they’re trying to champion, and I don’t know how to fix it enough that I feel okay in my own skin on campus again."

I tell myself it didn’t happen and I just made it all up. Exactly the way my family likes to see it.
 
But I’ve been threatened with all sorts of violent deaths. I’ve been brought to the brink of death through drowning. I’ve been strangled until I lost consciousness numerous times. I’ve been burnt with hot objects, forced to take drugs and tortured in various other ways. 
All of which happened so I could continue to be raped and used as a sex object. 
And of course the abuse didn’t stop there it went on for years, leaked into every part of my life and flourished like an infestation of evil. 
Hooray for my childhood.

Somehow this made me hyper vigilant and unable to trust anyone or too trusting which got me in even more irreversible trouble. 

It’s as if I’m a wounded animal in a pack that is continuously targeted by others preying on the weak. 

I remember being punished for my resulting apparent cowardice by being beaten up and spit on and various other corrective measures by kids in my neighborhood. 

So I decided to no longer be vulnerable when I was about 9 years old. I decided I’d be how people apparently wanted me to be:  
Disconnected from myself an my feelings and violent to anyone who tries to come close or even annoyed me. 

I haven’t healed. I’m still fighting fear on a daily basis. So I’m never at ease and everything is hard and painful. Even concentrating and understanding what other people say gives me a lot of anxiety.

Because of this anxiety I will probably not react to this post anymore until everyone has forgotten about it. 

I’m sure other people pick up on my fear. 
I feel I’m still being judged for being afraid. 
Afraid of things the people that judge me have never dealt with and never will. They will never have to look back on a childhood full of violence and abuse but they will judge me just the same. 

But I wonder how many people notice my fear and insecurities and just use it against me. 
I feel that a lot of people do because everyone is afraid to a certain degree and putting someone down is just a way for some to keep their illusion of power. 

How can I know the difference between someone I can trust and someone I should stay away from?

How will I know if they don’t have a hidden agenda?

I know that I have trust issues because of how I was treated for as long as I can remember but how can I ever trust anyone again?

I wish I could trust people but I don’t.

I found this year that i enjoy dulling down my reality instead of facing problems. 

 Drugs make me feel something, while dulling down the pain
I don't want to escape as much as i want to numb my thoughts from hurting myself. When my thoughts become verbal my moods lash out on others and it makes me hate my existence that much more. 
Which triggers a wave of suicidal thoughts, self doubt, and a can't do attitude. 
I just give up
I am sick and tired of holding the weight of these ideations within the thin barriers of my skull, im growing old and tierd.
When it started, i thought i brought these thoughts into my head, and i would feel shame for it. For why am i doing this to myself?
6 years later its gotten progressively worse, i quit drinking and began a regaulr pill regimen  (also smoking marajuana) to keep myself balanced, or calm. I was less on edge, found a bit of happiness within myself and my creative side and began to feel human again. 
Now the flip side to that is the rap sheet of side effects that come along with these pills.
Stabalize your mind, sacrifice your body.
It's taking a chance everytime, adverse reactions and misdiagnosis over those 6 years didn't help. By the timei was aged 25 i had been on or around 25 different pills and different combinations within of those pills. 
By the end of my 6 years medication tweaking process, and 3 misdiagnosis, 6 hospitalizations, and pretty much a team of specialists, and a dozen doctors,  along w a cat scan of my brain in 2014.
It took hell of a toll on my body, and brain functions. My liver an kidneys wont last forever..
The runaround, a serious uphill battle im still pushing through..learning a lot about my mind and mostly thought process.
Why am i so mean to myself? 

 and as of today my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder bi polar type, i struggle with anxiety (mostly social) and frequent panic attacks (which can be triggered by the way someone i know looks me wrong) me being called sensitive would be a huge understatement. Around the time of my first hospitalization in 2009 i witnessed my friend and roommate at the time get beat within an inch from his life with brass knuckles to the face. 
I remember nothing past the porch where he laid still, getting beat on our own front lawn repeatedly. 
My mind permanently blocked that from me.Next time i have a memory from that moment im looking over him-- laying in the blood soaked grass, in total shock. His face was a blood puddle, in panic mode i went and scooped him from his back to his feet. At that second i embraced his tall frail figure as his wounds dripped down onto my suicidal tendencies shirt (oh the irony)  my arms wrapped all the way around his body, for i just wanted him to feel safty or comfort. Grabbing him by the hand i guidedus to a safer space indoors.
Around me was a blur, friends and neighbors scolded me, for ""he could have a neck or back injury! Leave him laying!"" 
I was not only in shock, but also processing a violent and traumatic event that changed my life forever. 
I was scared, he was petrified. 
I told all the neighbors and by standers basically to fuck off and
As for my friend- now gushing blood from his cuts, eye sockets, mouth and nose. 
just like a skipping cd in your old walkman, he was stuck in a constant shuddering loop fearing for his life. 
""They're going to come back and kill me""
Over and over and over and over..
Once into our house i lead him into the bathroom, swiftly locking the door behind.
""Call 911, they're going to come back and kill me"" again and again as he ran water over his face, pressing his broken bone structure completely flat, blood pouring from all parts of his kind and beautiful face. 
He couldn't feel it, he could barely process what had happened, for it happened so fast. 
I watched him try to
Rinse all the blood away only more would streamout.&amp;Panic struck, the ambulance was now on its way but inwas starting to expierence by first delusion. 
After that summer i didn't see my friend again until 10 years later. 
What i said to him was, i have been through so much since then that stemmed from that dark moment in our past, struggled with literal demons inside my head, woken up to images of corpses laying in my bed. 
But i will never know how you managed to stay so strong, so beautiful, and so kind even after something so awful could happen. 
I have no idea how he did it i said, how he pulled through and came out on top.
Dude, he could have been beat to death if someone hadn't stepped in. 

One of the moments that shaped me, made me grow and helped me learn so much about myself id never had gotten the chance to if our paths may not have crossed. 
Cos i usually think ""man, i wonder what life would've became if these blips in time hadn't happened at all?""
Maybe id have some sort of success, or maybe just no chronic disorder that effects almost every aspect of my life in some sort of way. Im unsure, always wonder, then feel weak minded.
Soon after we went through this i found myself laying on my bare bed, last nights last breath escapingaway as the mourning sun crept through the crack in the window where the card board had shifted.
I stayed home all alone with my thoughts that night. 
Not knowing how many sleepless nights, and waking nightmares mixed with violent hallucinations id have ahead of me. 
The mind is a very fragile thing, science knows little about mental illness as it is-so to see me, 4 or 5 days later after that night, days became weeks then into one bad blurred summer.
To explain it all in full detail wouldn't make any sense whatsoever -but i basically looked like your local circle k crack head on no sleep talking to the air. 
Sad thing is, mental illness and drug addiction look a whole lot alike. 
Your brain looses one to many days of sleep then all the sudden i think im related to  Egyptian gods, and my brother is a cannabal living on an ancient Indian burial ground, and theres a government drone disguised as a house fly watching me.
The house was alive, and teeth snapped my feet at every step.
The windows were breathing. I sawa glimpse of a body on the stain in the laundry room, had conversations with hairless rats and sat in a chair crafted from hitlers bones.
I could feel the chill air pass, i felt negative spirits, saw shadow people while christmas carolers sang outside my door.
None of this was real, this was just a snipit of the things i've seen and heard but told they weren't really there. 
I was awake, yet dreaming in gruesome splashes and disorganized thoughts. 
I was alive to exist. 
I felt pain all over.
Once admited i was so unrulyi wasn't able to be near any other patients at least half a day to a day. I spent that time in the yellow hallway in the nude and a pair of flats, pissing on myself while flooding my room. 
When they brought my food, i ripped my name badge from the tray. I ate my name for dinner, refused the meal, kicking it across the hallway.
Water began to trickle out of my room, and by the time they asked me to get dressed they saw..
I shoved all the sheets, blankets and my clothes into the toilet, and sink only to keep them running and flushing til someone decided to check on my crazy naked ass.
I just didnt want to be alone.
So i made sure they had to keep me close, and segregating an unstable lil girl who wants to die and has no clue what reality is anymore is inhumane. 
I spent the next 3 weeks there making no damn sence, i was completely detached from reality coloring with crayons, banging my head inbetween the door way and the wall. 
It hurt everywhere in a different way, but they couldnt make it stop so i would hurt myself. 
I hadn't showered in over a week, 2 nurses insisted on helping me bathe. 
Once in the water all i could do was scream, cry and fight them.
I was 20.

((tw:sexual abuse)) Sometimes when I think about what happened too much ( I normally think about it at night because that’s often a time where I’m alone with my thoughts or might be trying to sleep in less clothing etc ) it’s almost like I can feel him touching me. Like his hand between me legs or something and I try to ignore it because normally it’s not too strong but sometimes it is. I try to change positions, roll up in a ball, squeeze my legs shut, roll around, or put a blanket between my legs to make it stop. It normally happens when I try to sleep in little clothes or without underwear in loose clothing. Often changing clothes helps, but the idea of taking off my already loose clothing is frightening. I never gave it much thought until now. I tried googling it and uh maybe wasn’t the best idea cause I couldn’t like immediately find a reassuring answer within the first few results. I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced this or found a better solution.	[]	[{'start': 297, 'end': 326, 'span': ' I can feel him touching me. ', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

In America at least (though Im sure in other places as well), once you become homeless or in poverty, you're no longer a part of ""society"". You're not a ""member of society"", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money. The moment you become """"worthless"""". 

Here's a conclusion i guess,,, Anyone else traumatized by poverty/homelessness, or more specifically, how people treated you because you were in poverty/homeless"	[{'start': 207, 'end': 232, 'span': 'I was homeless for a year', 'annotation': 'uncertain'}]	[]
5ca73fe6bcdcc2001291822d	2529_ptsd	"PTSD, or am I just over reacting? This might be triggering.

This is my first time posting here. I never really considered the possibility that I might have PTSD until very recently. I'm currently 31...when I was 19, I entered into my first real relationship. It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much. The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.

After, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be ""getting him excited"" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong... Basically, it was my fault. I lived with guilt, shame, and just overall disgust for a really long time. 

Ever since then, I have not been the same person. I lost trust in people....I can't enjoy sex....I'm afraid to date and fall in love....I'm afraid of men touching me.... I just avoid relationships and love all together. 

And that was just the first relationship. I don't even want to get into the second relationship, but he sexually violated me too. He purposely tampered with a condom to get me pregnant to keep me from transferring away to college. He thought that I'd decide to keep his baby and stay local with him. I aborted it and moved away of course. That was when I was maybe 22 or 23. That was the last relationship. I've been avoiding dating because I'm afraid of history repeating itself. I've been single ever since and honestly, I'm just lonely and depressed. I never spoke to a doctor about any of this. I don't know what I'd be diagnosed with but I'm afraid. 

Fast forward to now, there's a good person in my life who likes me. I think he's interested in me....I like him too but I'm still afraid. I don't know what to do or how to behave...I don't know what a good/healthy relationship is supposed to feel like. I'm just nervous all the time and its involuntary...I can't control how I feel. The new person said that I'm hard to read. Like, he doesn't know how I feel about physical touch... I'm sure he can tell that I'm nervous. I just don't want him to think that I'm not interested in him, or that I'm disgusted of him because that's not true. 

For a long time, I'd zone out...get lost in my thoughts. Oh, and nightmares. I'd have random nightmares of being attacked, violated, raped, assaulted, or just chased. Over the years I've been able to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, and that I shouldn't feel guilty or shameful. I tried practicing self love for a long time and I think it helped. I feel somewhat normal but I never really learned how to cope. 

I just need help. Or some advise....or encouragement."	[]	"[{'start': 344, 'end': 538, 'span': ""He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an absolute mess of a human and trying really hard to be okay, but a bit over a week ago I was watching a TV show with a boy I'm seeing where a girl was being raped and the rapist whispers 'shhhh' over and over. I tried to block my ears and i had my eyes closed, but the scene sprung up out of nowhere so i saw about 2 seconds of it.   


Ever since then I've been a mess. I've barely been able to shower, haven't been able to clean, haven't been able to eat, I didn't sleep properly for a few days (kept waking up every half hour). A couple of nights ago half way through sex I had a flashback and I don't remember anything after that, but apparently I was crying a lot and completely non verbal for a while. I 'completely shut down' and he had to really try to get any words out of me, apparently. the next morning i had false awakenings where i was just lying in bed being spooned, then his hand comes and grabs my mouth and shoves me into the bed. i woke up in a panic and realised he was just cuddling me so i must be dreaming, but other than that i absolutely can't distinguish what i dreamt from reality. I realise i've had the same thing before - dreams where 'arms', sometimes someones, sometimes invisible arms, grab my mouth and shove me into the bed.   


I have PTSD but I don't actually know what the cause is. I can make a very good guess, but I just have symptoms and learning my triggers, with no actual solid memories. apparently once I told a friend what i thought happened while i was throwing up and crying and screaming (first ever flashback episode), but i don't have any memory of even doing that.   


There was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't. He says it never happened. Now with this false awakening, I'm worried that I've thought ill of him when it actually was just all in my head. What if it was just a false awakening.   


I haven't been able to stop crying. i have this constant feeling of terror. And i have no one around me to help. because of my ptsd i push everyone away one way or another. when something triggers me like this i can end up completely non functional. i just want a normal fucking life and a normal brain and a boyfriend. i feel like i'm never going to be able to have any of that because of what some fucking cunt decided to do to a little kid."

tw: SA, controlling relationship, stalking, drugged

\------

\------

\------

PLEASE be warned i explain the source of my trauma here and i dont want anyone to be triggered.

&amp;#x200B;

i've recently been diagnosed with what my psychiatrist calls ""late-onset PTSD"", which i did not know was a thing that could happen. it stems from a pattern of episodes from when i was younger where my first serious boyfriend repeatedly drugged and raped me without my knowledge (until one day i wasn't ""out"" when he did it and tried to break it off with him soon thereafter). he then stalked and harassed me for about a year and a half after i broke it off with him. obviously the experience was upsetting and awful but i seemed to be okay for a few years after it happened. or at least i thought i was? 

&amp;#x200B;

but within the last several years i've had several people tell me that i seem like i've changed - i get extremely uncomfortable in big crowds (like at a concert) and i never used to feel that way, i obsessively check to make sure my door is locked, i feel the need to keep a weapon in my room even though i've never felt that way before, and i constantly fear that someone will break into my house (something that he would try to do when he was stalking me). there are other things but those are the big ones. i will be honest, i found out a few years ago that he moved out of state and i frequently check to make sure he is still far away from me, and i feel a lot of shame about that. i thought i was just having really, really bad anxiety related to the high pressure from school and work, and i've even been told that these periods of hypervigilance might be due to misdiagnosed bipolar II, but my doctor believes i have PTSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

i am in the medical field and my father has PTSD - i thought i understood this condition very well. but i guess i don't. so i am here to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience - a ""late-onset"" of PTSD - and how you dealt with it after years of thinking you had everything under control. i feel very lost, angry, confused, scared. it is hard for me to be intimate with other people in so many ways and i feel like i am losing my friends because of what i am going through. i am trying to find a therapist but they are all very expensive even with insurance, and i am on medication management (third round of combo antipsychotics and antidepressants, the last two didnt work, meds kind of help but not really). i don't know what to do anymore, so please, if you had a similar experience... can you share how you dealt with it? this is so exhausting."

Reading that scared the living hell out of me. I thought there was no way I could improve with a damaged brain. But today I learned that is just not the case. The brain is moldable. The brain is trainable. I don't know if I can gain back the actual brain mass? But regardless, I have been assured by my doctor that it won't impact my ability to recover.

TW: rape, sexual abuse

\-A little over 2 years ago, my ex raped me. There had been about a year of sexual abuse leading up to the rape. The manipulation and gaslighting and little things like forced kisses and groping fucked me up just as much as the actual rape.

\-A few weeks later, I met my current BF and fiancee. I truly believed he saved me from further abuse. He helped me cut my ex out of my life.

\-My BF is my ex's uncle (though they are the same age, they're family), but they are not in contact with each other and don't interact with each other's immediate family frequently.

\-I have had a lot of trouble trusting people after my abuse, My friendships are mostly people who my BF is friends with, people who he trusts I believe are safe to be around and I am more comfortable around them.

\-My BF's two close friends are dating each other. They have been together for years. I thought they were in love. They are extremely good friends with my BF, and I liked them and was very interested in being close to them as well.

**THE INCIDEN**T: My BF's good friends were apart for a few days. One of them told my BF he cheated on his partner with My abusive ex. My ex has told their friends that He raped them. 

I am in absolute shambles. I have spent years avoiding contact with my ex. Now not only have my friend destroyed his relationship to ""have sex"" with him, but I believe my ex was raped by him. I have to cut off a friend who I tried so hard to warm up to and put myself out of my comfort zone to interact with because I discover he is a PoS. And now my rapist is coming to me wanting help after they have been raped. The poor partner who has had their relationship destroyed is coming to me for help. I believe my ex is going to tell their family about what happened, which includes me since I am engaged to their uncle.

60ad4325e23286e1191e31aa	2458_ptsd	"Relationship problems caused by trauma Hi!

I had a very hard time during my childhood. My mom was mentally ill and beat me and my siblings on a daily basis and my dad beat my mom often in front of us children. My mom yelled at me for everything: If I laughed to much, If I cried, if I was angry so basically when I showed any emotion at all. If I did well in school (A:s were the only acceptable grade) helped her by being her emotional support as soon as I came home from school aka listening to her problems etc she would not beat me. But as soon as I did the slightest wrong she beat me and told me that she wished that she had just done an abortion etc 

I remember that my mom used to beat me when I was 4-7 years old just because I was so ugly. She pulled my hair and slammed me into a wall and she beat me and cried at the same time and yelled that I was a disappointment in every way. She forced me to have my hair up in a high ponytail or else she would beat me and pull my hair. I am born with a large forehead but the high ponytails only made it worse (I never wear my hair up now bc is how large of a forehead I have) I was also bullied because of that and because everyone knew that they beat me at home so in school they knew that I was an easy target, I remember just laying in my own piss one time because I was so scared after being beaten in school and scared of going home knowing that my mom would beat me because I pissed my pants. 

In conclusion my childhood sucked and that has caused a lot of problems now that I am a young adult F21, especially in my relationship. Me and my BF M21  has been in a relationship for 2,5 years and he is wonderful. The problem is that I am so insecure, I can worry that he will meet someone better if he goes away to work or just goes to buy some groceries. I am constantly feeling as if I am not enough and that he will leave me for anyone because I see other people as better than me, like I really mean every human I meet. I have a lot of anxiety and have a hard time talking to him about this, I really try to and are not actively refusing to talk but I often just don’t know how to describe it. I also don’t want to control him or let my anxiety make him shitty because it is not his fault, he has never given me any reason to even be worried but still I feel like shit. I feel sad sometimes and jealous when he hangs out with friends but I never tell him that he should not hang out whit them and he hangs out with them despite me having panic attacks and feeling as if I suck and that he will find someone better etc etc etc 

I am 100% aware that my feelings are not valid, I am loved but I just can not feel it and believe it. I go to trauma focused therapy (PTSD) so I am working on it and by BF knows about it and we always talk about it. He usually hugs me and tells me that he loves me etc and I just lay in his arms crying like a baby and knowing that my feelings are stupid but just can not make them go away.

So, Reddit or r/ptsd what do I do and am I the only one who feels like this?

I love my BF so extremely much and I really want to grow old with him and have kids and be together through everything but I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. As if I should leave him before he leave me and that this is an example of how fucked up and unworthy of love I really am. I just don’t want to hurt him and I know that my heart would shatter into pieces without him but if that is what is better for him then I want that. He says that he is happy and we really are happy most of the time but this ruins so much. 

And also, during one year I had this thing were I bought stuff on credit and it started out as what I thought a one time thing but then I used it as a coping mechanism. During that time I did not really understand that it was bad but when I realized about 6 months ago I knew that I needed to talk to my BF about it but I did not want him to leave me so I held it a secret for three more months and then I finally told him. I have ruined his trust in me now. I have never lied about anything and neither has he that has been like the most important thing in our relationship but now I ruined it.  We are trying to work through it and he says that he wants to be with me. 

I am a fuck up and just want to break up with my BF and kill myself because he would be happier without me.

So yesterday I had to take those medications and go through the side effects again. Little did I know, that as soon as the side effects began, they brought with them a massive flashback, that lasted for the duration of the effect of the meds, which was about 6 hours. 
I’ve tried different relaxation techniques, used my MMJ, had great support from my fiancée and even tried to take sedatives but NOTHING WORKED. I eventually fell asleep exhausted, into a restless sleep filled with nightmares.

After I told a friend I had been assaulted he tried to be supportive over text but stopped wanting to see me in person (he claimed he was really busy with work but it was kind of a thin excuse as it mostly applied just to seeing me, not anyone else). While its gotten a little better recently after I kind of told him I was upset that I had rarely seen him in months and that I thought it was linked to disclosure, I still feel like things arent the same anymore and it feels like the whole friendship is on thin ice. He's normally a pretty emotionally supportive person but I realize this kind of thing can be taken really differently. I still feel like there is this underlying tension, probably because he still says its because work was and has been really busy and so while I see him more often now (but not as often as before I said anything) i feel like the same thing can happen again at any moment if I do or say the wrong thing (like mentioning or alluding to assault at all).

This ever happen with anyone else? Advice on how to deal with friend?

And advice about how to deal with the impact of this on myself? Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad. But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame. I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it. I had told one friend over skype and she was supportive over text as well and didn't stop texting me or anything like that but I havent talked about it to her at all in person since she moved to the same city as me so I guess a part of me is worried she'd react the same way (not wanting to see me in person) even though she hasnt done anything like that. 

**TL;DR how do you deal with friend that suddenly feels uneasy around you after disclosure of trauma/ptsd?

I’ve never discussed a PTSD diagnosis with a doctor or therapist as I really didn’t think I could have it. I always assumed the trauma had to be physical or something along the lines of being in a warzone, not something such as verbal and emotional abuse. I’m curious as to how I could bring this up to a therapist or a doctor without looking like I’m making my problems more than what they are. 

When you were diagnosed, if you were, did you bring it up yourself? Or was it suggested? If you brought it up yourself, how did you do it? Were there any kinds of resources you had to back yourself up? 

I’m not saying this is the be all, end all of my mental issues, it’s just something overall that has made the most sense that encompasses all the problems I seem to face. It would be something worth exploring, I think.

&amp;#x200B;

some backstory:

C is a very manipulative and terrible person. C would constantly pit our friend group against each other and then was the ""ring leader"" sort of deal. C honestly never cared about any of us and just wanted our fully devoted attention.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm 21 now living in a different country and this happened to me when i was around 13/14 yrs old. i was at a party with a friend and we and a couple others had a sleep over together afterwards. the next morning i awoke to my friend (let's call her C) lightly caressing my private part down below. i thought i just had morning wood and ignored it until i was certain it was actually C doing it. i didn't really know what to do i mean i was never taught about sex (due to our school system failing us) and it felt sort of good but also sort of weird. this went on for about 20 min. and then i held her hand and C put her hand down my pants and did things for a bit then abruptly stopped. C had a partner and C told me C felt like C cheated and i reassured C that it was ok and that we don't have to talk about it ever again and we can pretend it didn't happen and this relieved C.

&amp;#x200B;

then a couple of years later i decide to end it with some of the people in the group, including C, because they're toxic. C then, after telling her this, tells me that I r\*ped her that night and told everyone imaginable that i was some rapist monster. everyone shunned me and i was completely alone. C told their relatives and they wanted to talk so then i told my parents and it was the most embarassing thing to have to explain. we eventually moved away and i'm starting to find peace but being told i r\*ped somebody when really i was the one who was sexually and mentally taken advantage of has given me severe PTSD (i've seen a therapist about this for about a year now) and also developed into a host of other problems.

&amp;#x200B;

the biggest problem i have is that i fear so much to go out in public. i fear that everyone knows and thinks i'm disgusting and ontop of all that i feel disgusting. my body was basically used and thrown away by C and even after C did this to me and told the school i was a r\*pist, one of our mututal friends who still talked to me told me C said that i ""had a nice d\*ck"" like what the fuck. i feel so much shame and  violated, uneasy, disgusting, etc. and i've felt like this for almost the majority of my life now because i had no way to cope with it or deal with it healthily until seeing a therapist recently. i feel so damaged and i blame myself honestly for even getting into that situation to begin with. i wish i could've gotten away but it seems like C will always loom over me and have power over me because C is a ""victim..."" 

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time in a while posting in a forum about this. I was pretty badly beaten for a few years by a partner. I have monthly nightmares about him throwing things at me, cursing at me and threatening me with objects, he did much more but for some reason I usually just dream about the anger and intimidation prior to the actual acts themselves. I think because it was that stage that lasted the longest (an hour or two), it hurt me more mentally than the usual 30 seconds to a minute of when he did hurt me physically, Idk maybe easier to block out than the awful screaming and personal attacks.
I also get nightmares of the cheating and of being an inadequate woman. 

I also have noticed I tend to flinch pretty dramatically when things are thrown or tossed at me when I'm unaware. My depression and anxiety have gotten so bad and I started seeing a counselor last year, and started medication. I've gained  20-30 pounds because i just feel like it's pointless to care about my appearance half the time, my self confidence is really jacked up now. I use to be such a happy person. I always had depression and anxiety but it feels amplified now. It's like I just have a pit in my stomach all the time.

 I use to wear fun dresses and high heels. I use to go on spontaneous adventures. I use to be so carefree and trusting. I'm a fat shell of who I use to be, and it really hurts me when people bring up how fun I use to be. I don't like being unfun, but it's been so hard to dig myself out. I also have 2 young kids which doen't help either lol. I do try,  I try to self care and do what use to make me happy but it just doesn't work.

I recently started therapy and meds for depression and anxiety and it took a few visits to bring it up , I felt dismissed , she said ""he was young"". No I wasn't talking to you to fucking justify it but being on state health insurance it's hard to find good ones out of the few approved therapists in your area. 

Shit when I told my separate doctor that prescribes them that my anxiety didn't feel any better she only had 1 other med to try and then basically said if that didn't work then I just wont have an anxiety medicine that works for me. (We've only tried 2 so far). 

I just wish I wasn't like this. I wish I never went through it,  I wish I could be who I was before everything. I feel like I'll always be the victim now."

5d2a1b1a4588590018cf6fd4	1744_ptsd	"Got triggered by the news and can't stop being depressed since (sexual assault) Not sure this is the right place to talk about this, I've never really used reddit before. Hopefully someone can help or at least understand what I'm struggling with.
I've been through major trauma 8 years ago, as I was walking home from school a man attacked me. He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.
He eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.
What followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. 
I've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.
My family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). 
I couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.

I kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost. I couldn't hold memories for a while and if you ask me about my last year in high school it's pretty confusing, I just remember parts and not in order. Depression, anxiety, fear or strangers, panic attacks and dissociation would come and go. 
Sometimes I'd just not feel anything, and sometimes I'd be angry at people for not understanding me.
I started doing therapy and slowly healing but still found it hard to deal with my emotions.

Eventually, I went to this Buddhist temple and started meditating, which really helped me and brought me back to reality. I stopped having panick attacks and was able to not think about it so much.
Going to college also helped, cause it felt like a new stage of life and I quit therapy because I felt no need to keep going.

Now, I've been doing pretty well in my life and most of the time don't even think about what happened. But the other day I read on the news about a 3 year old who was sexually abused, she was found with her diaper full of blood. Just typing this makes my eyes well up.
I can't stop thinking about that, about how fucked up the world is, and keep having flashbacks of what happened to me. It's making me depressed, affecting my relationships, my sex life and daily life.
I'm living far from my family, and I don't wanna tell them what's going on because they will just feel upset and powerless.
I try to forgive myself for not doing anything like running or kicking him, or just paying more attention because I didn't even see him approach me.. 
I guess now I'm just having a mix of emotions, I don't wanna live in the past but I'm not feeling connected to the present no matter how hard I try.

I feel very lonely because the people who love me can't really understand my feelings and I know they hurt too, but in a different way. I feel helpless.
I'm not even sure this is just PTSD or something else, if there is anything I can or should do...

In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. 

Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didn’t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know.

I was diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, Depression etc, etc after I came out of a coma from a failed suicide attempt in 2014. Many things/instances led me down the path I am currently on... childhood abuse (physical, sexual, mental) onto a lifetime of abuses (again physical, sexual, mental) and other tragedies mixed in like the death of my daughter...

Well, onto my current issue.. I had deactivated Facebook when I got out of the hospital. Besides that my memory was mush, people on that account had known what was occurring, contributed to or even blamed me for ""letting myself be tortured "". So it was wise to end communication....

I recently went back onto that account to ask for help. I had created a gofundme account as living on disability sucks, and I needed a little help to start earning my own money again. (I have a separate Facebook I just opened 7mo ago for family only and have been fine with that).

So with getting back on this old account, I was reading comments like ""if there is anything I can do to help"", so I thought I would give it a try... while trying to ignore the post from the woman who had an affair with my husband calling me a ""dear friend"" while I was in a coma and could not lose my ever loving mind on her.

You can guess where this is going... I am back to being ANGRY, HURT, BETRAYED , and a very unhealthy dose of self hatred /loathing constantly. These are people who knew what was going on, the pain I was in and still in and are seriously responding with things like ""glad things are going good for you"".

I am accustomed to not being heard when I speak, cry or beg for mercy... why was I such a fool to tell these people I am still suffering? Why did I try for help? Why did I think they cared? Is my brain so muddled that I convinced myself I mattered to these people?

It was very hard for us.  His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had.  I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home.  There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot.  Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month.  After that, it was a downward spiral.  We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families.  We kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument.  After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started.

I am inherently a very loud, extroverted person, but I just can't seem to vent about certain things. No matter how hard I try. Like I know what the vent would be about. I'm hypersexual, and I have issues with my gender and my religion. But the sections where I write out, even in a private journal where no one can see, feel such an immense panic that I just can't get it out onto paper.

I get that this is common, and most people can just suck it up and move on, but because I'm such a loud person, I've established a status quo with people that I will come to them when I'm upset. That's why when these things cross my mind and start throttling me, I want to be able to go to them and talk about it, but I get overwhelmed with such a large amount of panic that I just can't function. I feel like I'm denying them, or that I should tell them.

But it's not like I can just go on hiding it forever. It's a persistently invasive part of my life that has consistently made me very upset on a number of occasions but what am I supposed to do?

recently i've started watching Harlots on hulu, and in it there are several scenes where a character is either sexually assaulted or raped. i have no memory of either of these things happening to me, but for some reason when i saw them it immediately set off a panic attack and had me crying inconsolably. this has only happened a handful of other times before when a friend showed me a graphic novelization of a story shared by several comfort women from WWII, and when i wasn't fast enough to fast forward through the opening scene of an L&amp;O: SVU episode. i've never had this reaction when someone on either of these shows mentions an act of assault or describes it, it was only the graphic depiction of it. the only other thing i can really latch onto is that, when i read about someone being assaulted on the news or through social media topics, i get a very weird feeling down there. it's not pain, just a reflex, but it absolutely isn't enjoyable. it starts off this very heavy feeling in my stomach that sticks with me for hours, and i feel very detached from everything afterward.

is it possible that something has happened to me and i've just blocked it out so heavily that i can't even go back to a moment in time that would hint to me why i'd be reacting this way? i was predated on in the past, through chatrooms in an online game i used to play, but i never met anyone i talked to and therefore had no physical contact with them. i'm afraid to ask my family, because someone will immediately say i've made it up and that nothing bad has ever happened to me. i just want some kind of answer, and if anyone could help me i'd really appreciate it. thank you."

Texas also does not care if children are or are not in school.

&amp;#x200B;

2016: The hellhouse explodes in the middle of the night while I'm inside, catches fire, and burns down. No insurance. Bunch of animals die. Sad. Those were basically my only friends. I run away in the middle of the night and don't tell my family. Got 850 miles away. Drove from South Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, to Eastern Nebraska in two days. Stayed in my car. Stayed on the couch of someone I only knew from the internet. Rented a room in a house with strange guys from craigslist. Got screwed out of that and given the wrong date for move out. Had to leave asap. Rented a room in another house sight unseen. Hoarder lady. Cat shit in a room. No cat. Doors don't lock on the house. Random people show up and drop things off for my landlady. I have no idea who they are, they just walk in and leave shit. Can't find/afford anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

2017: Finally manage enough money for an apartment. Worked 6 days a week. Worked sick. Get apartment. Calm down. Have safe/private space. Hate Nebraska though. Feel anxious. Tornadoes in the summer. Hail every spring. Ice/snow in winter. Icy roads I'm not used to driving on. Scared of the environment all the time. Car engine dies that fall. Sink my savings into having to buy another car off craigslist. Can't afford to be without a car. Had gotten a better paying job at a call center during this year, but still struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

2018: Start trying to recover savings. That fall apartment building gets struck by lightning while I'm inside. Lightning. It also burns down. Insurance doesn't cover everything. Now in debt. God is pursuing me with fire. Reality isn't real. I am destined to die. I am being pursued. Something is after me. Why is this happening again? Brain goes to space world. Resume brief homelessness and stress of recovering after fire #2. Red cross offers no help to even transport me anywhere because I have 2 dogs. My phone is in the burned building. I have no family or friends nearby. I don't even have shoes on. Mental state falls apart. Can't take time off work long due to money. Cause problems with boss/at work due to emotional instability/unwillingness to take a schedule change. Boss says I should bring him a doctors note saying I have problems after I oversleep one day due to having a panic attack the night prior. Ignores that he gets medical insurance in this company and I don't. Tells me he thought he had been very lenient by letting me have 5 days off after the fire. Never get doctor's note. Live in fear.

&amp;#x200B;

2019: A chaotic mess. I want to leave Nebraska so bad. I am scared all the time. I am scared every time it rains/storms. I am scared every time a machine in the wall hums weirdly. I am scared when I hear sirens or alarms and sometimes mistake phone rings and stuff for them. I hallucinate smoke when I walk into rooms sometimes. I am scared when I have to drive, and terrified when it is in snow. I am scared of my bosses. I am scared of losing my job. I am scared of calling in when flashbacks and panic attacks interrupt sleep. I am scared of becoming homeless again. I am scared of wasting time feeling miserable only to die before anything gets better. I am indignant and frustrated that I cannot motivate myself to try any harder to get out of here. I am angry I do not have any parents to fall back on or ask for help or money. I am angry there is no way for me to easily get to Oregon. I am angry I feel as tired as I do and people are still mean. I am angry my job doesn't give me insurance. I am angry I make too much for assistance despite how like a stupid feral child I am, but seemingly not enough to afford consistent care. Don't want to do call center work but don't know what else to do that I can survive on. Want a hug from someone safe and somewhere to sleep."

So last night around 1am, I was in bed getting ready to sleep and I heard keys jangling outside my door, and I  just assumed it was my neighbours. I live in private student accommodation, so we have 24 hour security, I generally feel very safe. But then, after hearing these keys, my door began to open and a security guard walked in. I jumped out of bed to speak with him, apparently he'd had a noise complaint, my TV was on but it wasn't loud enough to be heard from where the complaint was, so he apologised for disturbing me and left. After he was gone I just broke down, it scared me so much

This morning I found out he filed a report himself because he's new to the job, and had thought that my flat was one with a communal living space, ie. A flat he would be allowed to enter without knocking. He had no idea he was walking into a studio flat, essentially my bedroom.
I know that this guy made an honest mistake, I'm not upset about that. It just upset me so much to have someone walk into my space like that with no warning. I don't necessarily want to go into my PTSD diagnosis on this post, but I'm so shaken up by this event.
I really don't feel like being in my apartment at all, and I can't sleep because I feel like someone could just walk in. I'm so on edge and I'm so tired. I feel like I'm overreacting, but when I think about it I start shaking. I just don't feel like anyone understands, so I guess that's why I'm here, I wanted to get it off my chest to people who would understand.

Sorry for any mistakes, I'm on mobile and I'm pretty sleep deprived.

So, when i was around the age of 13 I went to a mental hospital to help me with my suicidal thoughts and depression. The place was horrible and caused me a lot of trauma. The staff were abusive and gave me so much medication that on my 8th day of being there i only thought it was my 3rd day due to how out of it i was.
So, for the most part i barely remember everything that happened there but sometimes i get random flashbacks to moments I either blocked out or didn't remember due to the medication.

One I recently remembered happened around my last day there. The only reason I left was due to the fact that i had a melt down during visitations and my family forced me out of the hospital, by now I'm questioning if this was one of the things that caused my tipping point.

I have bad psoriasis, it was especially bad back then. Covered 75-80% of my body, so i constantly had to use medicine. The staff would give me it after taking my pills and I'd go to a private room by myself to apply it.
Well, near the last day a nurse didn't hand it to me but instead took it, brought me to a different room, took my shirt and pants off without warning, then started applying it to my body. She then went on to go underneath my underwear to apply it onto my backside.

I was too confused and dazed to really do anything or tell her I was uncomfortable because the medication instantly hit me with drowsiness/fuzziness but i remember feeling humiliated and shocked by it.

She was a female nurse, kind of sweet but could be very rude at times. She often picked favorites as well. This memory just came out of the blue and i instantly felt so fucking disgusted and shocked because it didn't seem or feel right and I never remembered it until i was just randomly looking back on my experiences there. 

I'm questioning if it's okay for me to feel this way about it. I feel guilty because maybe she was just really use to taking care of little kids and got carried away? Is that behavior normal? No one else in the hospital did that to me from what i remember.  I'm scared to see a doctor and talk to them about my mental health and worries though because i don't wish to deal with that all over again, too much happened in such a short amount of time and yet i barely remember most of it. The place is still up and running despite all the horrible reviews and stories of abuse."

(Sorry if there is bad grammar or anything I didn’t want to go over it)[sorry if I repeated my self in this it’s 12:40Am) What’s happening to me: I am 14 years old in my family my mom and her bf have fought a lot and still do fight. I live with my mom, her bf,my brother ,and my little sister.i am normally the only sibling at the house when they start to argue,well except for my little sister but she is always asleep when it happens. First they start off arguing and it get annoying bc Ik they r going to start fighting!...but then they start to yell loud enough for me to hear what they r saying.sometimes I tell them to stop or I just leave them alone bc they say I make it worse.Im not gonna say what they fight about... but it get pretty bad sometimes. Some of them have turned into physical fights,well most of them...and I always see all of it!and I have seen my mom get pushed and her finger get snapped/broken by her bf.she obviously has to fight back for self defence so she does..but he try’s to convince her to give him another chance and that he will change.he says that every single time and yet he still haven’t changed.I even told my mom that...they suffer from alcohol education and my mom thinks that’s the only way she can fall asleep.and some times she gets black out drunk and gets mad at me easy and when I say something that makes her upset... she takes it out on me and if not me her bf mostly her bf tho.. but some fight have scared me half to death bc I thought it was gonna end up in death. I thought one of them was gonna get killed.And if they r fighting downstairs I can hear them hitting each other if it’s physical or if they r going at each other or push each other and it makes a loud noise, like a bang on the ground or something.
But the things I’m experiencing (the after effects) they don’t know about...
Let me explain.
So I have bad anxiety(I haven’t rly been diagnosed with it but my mom know I have it and it’s rly bad to the point where I have anxiety attacks) but I always get triggered when I hear a big stomp upstairs, I always think it’s them fighting again and I get rly scared, but when I go up it’s just my siblings playing around,and I have to try and clap down.
(Loud bangs,slap sounds ,yells,other noises)scare me anxiety kicks in right away. Also sometimes I wake up and I think they are fighting again but I go down and they are sleeping and it’s just the tv,but it sounded like they are fighting.so I Can’t rly go back to sleep easy. Or if they are talking loud r sometimes just talking Normally and I’m upstairs in my room it’s sound like they are arguing and my anxiety get triggered and I feel like I want to cry,even when my mom is talking on the phone she kinda talks loud a lot bc I think she is losing hearing a little,so she talks a little louder than needed and it triggers me bc I keep thinking I hear them arguing but it’s just them talking normally.
I have watched this YouTube video and there where parents arguing in it and I immediately started crying bc it gave me some kinda flash back ig and it sounded exactly like there fighting. Sometimes I can’t sleep especially when they argue. And when I’m class the topic of abuse or any kind of toxic family topic come up I have to leave the class and clam down.

665b2b52e8e62bc79a7332fc	2323_ptsd	"I’m in recovery, and doing well. But sometimes I just get so angry I was diagnosed almost a year ago now with ptsd, and my recovery is going 
really well. I get panic attacks sometimes at night still, but it’s no longer every single night, and I can get on the tube, stay at peoples houses etc and although I still get a little freaked out it’s definitely far more controllable than it was. Overall I’m happy with how well I’m doing. 

One thing I struggle with though is my anger. I have a follow up appointment with a therapist on March 3rd, which is 3 months after I was discharged as I no longer am any risk to myself (yay!) so I’ll talk to him about it, but I just wanted to post about it here.

Sometimes I just think about my situation, I had a good few male friends who decided to side with my friend who assaulted me, which is a pattern of how all of them have treated women. I didn’t realise how they treated the females in their lives until I put all of these events together and realised. They aren’t nice people, and sometimes that just makes me so angry because they’re all just going to live their lives genuinely convinced that turning against a victim of sexual assault and covering it up was something that was justified because of their own personal issues. It makes me angry to the point of tears and I just want to be able to keep it under control, but im not sure how.

I’ve been told this anger is normal, but I haven’t ever had to deal with it because before this i was super non confrontational and calm so it’d be nice to hear some tips, if anyone has any."

Loss of friendship, depression, anxiety, low key suicidal, emotionally broken, sexual discomfort

I don't know if the stuff I'm about to write is actually triggering, but I'd rather post a warning too many than too few. 
There is no violence or physical/real life confrontation in the post to come. It took place via chat. 

Hey all. First time here - let me start by saying thank you for having this community. 
I am sorry my first post is gonna be jumping right in and asking for help, but I have nowhere else to turn. 
My friends can only do so much and my therapy sessions are cancelled for at least 2 weeks as my entire country is on lockdown of all non-essential things. 


So, here goes. 
3 days ago was a day as days normally are. Get up, eat some, whatever else. 
However, completely out of the blue I get a message from a guy I considered my best real life friend. A guy I have had movie weekends with, making costumes, crafting jewellery, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a lot of hugging and a ton of common interests. 
I'm not exaggerating when I'm saying this guy might be the best part about my daily life in real life(except for the hobbies that keep me busy and alive). 
In the message, less than 2 weeks after we hung out, laughed, talked and hugged, he wrote to me that he realized it was gonna seem like thunder from a clear sky, but he didn't feel comfortable around me anymore and because he was unable to tell me when something was crossing a boundary of his he had to end our friendship effective immediately. 
The behaviour he was triggered by was what I considered normal jokes. Normal jokes with awcual undertones, pretty normal stuff. But what I didn't know was that he has a traumatic past that made such jokes incredibly uncomfortable to him and he never told me I was crossing his boundaries so I did not see it coming a mile away, especially since he and I had been together and had fun shortly before then. 

I cried for several hours, just looking at my computer at nothing, crying and wiping my face. When I was done crying I started imagining what I was gonna do now. And the thought of suicide entered my mind and presented itself as a logical option to solve all my problems. I don't think I'm gonna make an attempt, in my 30 years I haven't ever, but the fact that the thought entered my mind and seemed like a reasonable option scared me. 

I made it through the day. And I slept. But things didn't get better. 
Since then I've been unable to find the motivation to live. I am a hobby artist and usually I am so passionate and active that I forget to go to bed and sometimes remember that I haven't showered for 2 days. Gross, I know, but that should say something about the magnitude of my obsession with my hobbies. 
For the last 3 days I have done none of it. I have been immersing myself in a large computer game to disconnect from reality. I have a constant sadness and it feels like my entire body is slugging through a hot, dry environment but without being dry. My chest feels like it's being compressed. Whenever I stop and let my mind rest my pulse starts racing and I feel an overwhelming anxiety. 
And since then I have hated myself and my own sexuality to the point where just thinking about sexual desires or activity will make me nauseated, guilty, sad, angry and deeply uncomfortable. 

How do you all deal with being traumatized like this? I was already fragile, but I was making real progress. Now it feels like I've been dragged 5 years back, like being pulled backwards into a vat of icy water, struggling to get back up. 
I don't remember the last time I felt this broken. I feel like I've lost everything. And I have no idea what to do.

665b2b52e8e62bc79a7332fc	2224_ptsd	"Insomnia and loss of appetite from my event(s) I think that a lot of things have happened in my life that qualify to have caused PTSD, but usually I forced myself to not feel those emotions or try to rationalize the event in my head so I didn’t have to deal with any feeling other than personal accountability.

But this last event, that happened in December, was bad. The things that happened after it were also bad. Talking to the police was bad (and ineffective). The person who did this is still doing it to other people and that’s bad. They’re in my town and that’s bad. I’m so terrified of running into them. I check doors and parking lots constantly and obsessively. I know that’s not normal but it’s better than having to see them.

On top of that I’m not sleeping or eating. I can’t fall asleep at night, even after 1-2 doses of light sleeping meds. The most I can manage is four or five cumulative hours per night (max). Food doesn’t taste good anymore. I have to force my self to eat, but it’s sometimes easier to just let myself be hungry because with my intense workout schedule, I’m hoping it will just make me tired enough to sleep at night if that makes sense. Yesterday I tried boxing without headgear + weak defense to see if getting hit hard enough would help me sleep.

And when I DO sleep it’s just bad dreams. Not fun.

No; therapy is not an option currently. My family doesn’t know my PTSD is this bad but it’s much better if they don’t (it will get tense, lots of explosive fighting, etc). 

I’m worried because last night, at boxing practice, I think everyone noticed something was wrong. Or at least a lot of people. They said I looked really tired and like something was off. It’s a small, close group too. One guy talked to me after everyone left, and said if something’s going on I can talk to them.

I felt horrible because I didn’t know what to say. In my experience, people don’t genuinely care unless they get something out of it. Generally they just don’t. I don’t want them to treat me differently if they find out what I’ve gone through and what I’m dealing with mentally. They’re the only group of people that treats me with respect, and that’s the only place I feel like my hard work is validated. I don’t want that dampened with pity. And that’s assuming they’d want to be involved in this at all...

I’m a mess; I’m sorry. This post turned into something it wasn’t intended to at all. This is how my brain is currently working and I can’t fix it. Or the food or insomnia. Any suggestions accepted."

So I recently broke up with my girlfriend over a big fight. It wasn’t the first time we had a fight like this and every-time we get into an argument she tends to get very defensive and start attacking me. She gets into this rage of cursing me out loud regardless of where we are or who we are with and goes on for 30 minutes. In the beginning of the relationship, I thought this to be more nothing more than anger management and her personality. She tends to be very aggressive with her words and starts attacking the other person when she feels like she gets taken advantage of. There are a few restaurants that Im still ashamed to go because my ex and I caused a very unpleasant scene. I mean everyone gets like that when they get mad but it was way too extreme. She had so much hatred and negativity against certain type of people and would even mention of hurting the others at extreme.

After the breakup, I had some time to catch up with a friend. We were just having a couple of drinks just chatting and the word “PTSD” was brought up. And this word instantly hit me so hard... I mean folks I never experienced it and never thought I would meet anyone who had it. But deep inside me I knew my ex was going through PTSD. 

One of the symptoms she had was nightmare. She never shared her nightmare with me except for once and I never insisted on her telling me since it always put her in a bad mood. But that time she told me, it’s someone trying to attack her and she cant seem to do anything about it..... The other physical symptoms she had (at least thats what I think) were her migraines. She was very sensitive to noises. She would scream in th middle of the night and scared the shit out of me. She also would jerk her leg at night saying it hurts and would not be able to go to sleep. She told me she has a bad memory. All of this indicate that she has PTSD but I was oblivious to the symptoms.  Now that I have learned this, I only have regrets of not being more understanding and guiding her in th right direction. Although I have to admit that I was very exhausted from this relationship I cant deny the fact that I still love her and care for her.    Im willing to put myself in her shoes even if that means I take away just a little of the pain she goes through.

Folks, I would love to hear some of you guys go through. Obviously talking about symptoms is not pleasant but if anyone is willing to share what they have to go through it will be much appreciated.

Realised that this illness has more subtlety than I realised. I've lived with it for two decades, and have been treated for it for five years. I've learned so much and grown so much but the heavy handed illness has yet to relinquish most of its more subtle, insidious, elements.

I am moving into my own place soon but I can't stop thinking about all the ways it could go wrong. How terrified and weak I feel in having to get assistance. My last semester's marks came back as full honours, yet I can't accept that because in my mind they were not good enough. Subtlety. The dread of failure, the insecurity of not having control.

I never told my parents (that I remember, it happened when I was 5-6 and my parents have always treated me like a dramatic liar so maybe I did tell them and forgot)

Last year (I was 25 or 26) my mother told me that when I was a child I used to be happy and curious and full of life, and that it suddenly changed ""for no reason"". I have no memories of ever having been anything other than a sad, sometimes angry child. She can be quite abusive emotionally so I'm not really sure what she wanted me to take away from that, it felt a little accusatory like she believes 5 year-old-me decided to become bitter just to flex on her.

It reminded me of when I was 13 and I went to a doctor for my insomnia. After talking with her and testing a few things she wanted to talk to my parents so they came with me to the next appointment. he told them that there seemed to be no physical problem but from our conversation she could tell that I probably needed therapy. My father basically told her that I was a dramatic idiot who made things up for attention and we left.

Now the trauma is resurfacing, new memories are coming and I can barely function. Not to mention the added trauma of having grown up without effective coping mechanisms and the abusive relationship I got into and stayed into because I didn't know I was a human being who deserved to be treated as such. I'm so angry and I can't stop thinking about where I would be now if they had allowed me to get help 14 years ago, or better yet 22 years ago when they noticed something had drastically changed.

so i’ve opened up to my best friend about a lot over the years, and she always seemed pretty understanding of my trauma and everything. but in the past few months it really seems like she’s either forgotten that i went through severe trauma or just thinks it’s not that big a deal and i don’t really have ptsd. i first noticed it when we ran into my abuser and she seemed to warn me at first, but then told me to “stop being such a little bitch” when i started having a panic attack and wanted to leave the store. this just really got to me because i know she has been in almost the exact same situation and i did whatever i could to help her and get her out of there, but when it’s me i need to get over it so she can keep shopping for candy. something like this happened again when she tried to pressure me into going to a concert of someone who’s music severely triggers me and i straight out told her “i can’t do that it would severely trigger my ptsd”, but then she spent 10 minutes afterward trying to convince me to go because it’s her favorite singer and she doesn’t want to go alone. i just feel like she’s being completely selfish and expecting me to compromise my mental health so that she can have fun. i’m at the point where i just want to cut her off but i feel like i can’t do that without expressing my feelings at least once so here we are i guess. idk if i’ll tell her any of this because i’m really not looking to have a fight or talk shit out, at this point it’s pretty obvious to me that she doesn’t really respect me and repeatedly ignores one of my biggest struggles in life. i just can’t have a friend who i’m scared to hang out with because i think they’ll try and force me to stay in triggering situations and i definitely can’t have a friend who tells me to get over it after telling them everything i’ve been through."

I've seen and intervened in my fair share of fights. Last week was different though. I came out of my room after dismissal and saw two boys going after another in the hallway. Teachers were already there, but the campus security was outside dealing with another fight. Right as I entered the hallway the two boys started swinging at the other. The teachers tried to apprehend the two, so I went and grabbed the other one holding him up against the wall.

What I didn't realize is that I had grabbed the one who didn't want the fight to happen, so when the two boys broke free from the other teachers I ended up being a human shield. It's all a blur after that, I just remember them yelling in my face and throwing fists at me and the boy I was protecting. Eventually, other people got involved, but I couldn't move or I was putting the boy in more danger. The only injury I have is a bruise inside my lip, but after my adrenaline settled it triggered some other trauma I have from my parents growing up. Today at work when I looked down the empty hall I almost burst into tears.

654e60c7652a6e1ea8418ebe	2155_ptsd	"*tw: sexual assault* my story, and a few questions **Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault**

okay so this is gonna sound weird so i'll start from the beginning

So, it started two years ago when I met a girl we'll call Jamie. So Jamie and I had a lot in common, and immediately became friends. I was new in town and she was my first friend.

The trouble started a year later, (I was 12 at this point, yup I know I'm young) when she started making some horrible comments. For example I told her I was bullied at my last school and she smirked and said ""Oh, so you're an easy target"" It felt weird, I wasn't sure how to react.

Later, when school started again, she kept making comments like those or about my body. I definitely was an early bloomer and she was as well, but she really bugged me about some things about myself.

Then, she molested me. Several times.

At first it was subtle touches, and she told me she was just physical with friends. I thought it was weird because she wasn't that way with other people.

Then it got worse, like a lot worse. Not rape, but intense making out etc.

So that happened at the end of the school year and I didn't see her over the summer.

It was the worse summer of my life, and when school started I was extremely suicidal. At this point, I told a close friend. They helped me a lot.

Jamie took it way too far a few days ago. I'm shaken over it. I just want to get her out of my life.

Jamie is still abusing me.

But here's my problem. I want to report Jamie, I really do. But I feel like I can't for two main reasons

1. She's popular at my small school, everyone knows her. It's a private school, so everyone knows each other anyways but she seems like such a nice person on the outside.
2. I don't want to go to a hospital/inpaitient. I'm terrified of that.

Please, if someone knows what I can do say something. I'm sick of feeling alone."

Today was the first time I put this in words and finally explained it to my wife and now I don't know where to go from here.

So, I'm currently in therapy for PTSD as well as other things. Over the last year I've worked through DBT skills group to help me learn new coping skills in preparation for PE. But now that I've completed group and it's time to start PE my therapist thinks I'm not ready. She doesn't think that I've stopped blaming myself and that PE right now will only make things worse for me. I don't know what to do with that information because I don't know how to stop blaming myself.

A little background, I'll put as much as my brain will let me. Seven years ago my only child passed away. His death was in part due to hospital error. I know you're probably thinking ""That sounds like the hospital's fault not yours."" but hear me out. There was a sequence of events that lead to his death, and in this sequence of events there were times I could have done something and didn't. I made several conscious decisions as things unfolded. I saw with my own eyes that the hospital wasn't following protocol. I knew this because they had already explained the protocol and we had to sign releases giving them permission explicitly for this particular treatment. I knew this. But when I saw them breaking that protocol I was too damned scared to say anything. I was too much of a coward to face my fear of confronting the staff to say anything and I __chose__ to stay quiet. Later, I had a second opportunity to speak up and I again chose not to. Then, when things had progressed too far, they believed his heart was beginning to fail and asked us if they should resuscitate, but that it might not do any good. My wife was too scared to answer so __I made the decision to let him go__. I made the decision to let my own child die.

I feel like the hospital metaphorically put a loaded gun to my child's head and I saw it happening and did absolutely nothing to stop it. I may not have pulled the trigger but I saw what was happening and my own cowardice stopped me from doing anything.

How do I not blame myself for this? How do I let go of feeling like I played a part in this when I made actual conscious decisions that lead up to my own child's death? I'm being told that PE is my best hope and chance of getting better but that I can't do it until I'm ready to stop blaming myself. But I have no fucking clue how to do that. So this is where the advice comes in. How have you guys gotten over feeling like it's your fault? What did you do to get you over that hump so you could start healing?

Thanks in advance for reading and any replies with help/advice you guys have."	[]	[{'start': 826, 'end': 913, 'span': 'Seven years ago my only child passed away.

I'm freaking out right now. My rabbit is sick, and we don't know what's wrong. She finally stabilised today, and the vet was frankly shocked that she survived. He's running some tests now to determine what caused this episode (GI stasis and hypothermia, in case you were wondering). Thing is, this is a huge trigger for me and I have no idea why. 

The things that happened to me when I was a child were physical in nature for the most part, the only ""traumatic"" event I can think of that involved a pet was when my mother accidentally reversed over our (very old and deaf) cat while I was in the car. It was upsetting certainly, but compared to the other things that happened it seems ""minor"".

We lost another rabbit about 6 months ago to a tumor on her heart, and that broke me. I had to take time off work (I still haven't gone back) and that episode finally pushed me to seek therapy. At the time, I saw it more as the straw that broke the camel's back, but now I'm wondering if maybe there's something more.

I fucking hate this all consuming anxiety. I can barely function. I can't eat, I barely sleep, I've had constant nightmares, and I've just burned through my anti-anxiety meds. I'm even doing the hyper-vigilance thing with my other pets now, analysing their every move for any signs of illness. I know intellectually that they're okay, but I can't stop freaking the fuck out about it. 

Worse still, my partner is dealing with their own anxiety so I can't lay this all on them either without making them feel awful.

Rereading this it looks like I've got some serious trigger bullshit going on here, but I have no idea what it could be.

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

62aa1fefabb116cb465a45fc	2166_ptsd	"Waking up at the same time every night (TW seeing death happen. Graphic detail.) I’m no stranger to C-PTSD. I was officially diagnosed in 2017 after major trauma I dealt with at the hands of a mental health facility. 

I know waking up myself and the whole household screaming in my sleep, hearing sounds and voices relating to my trauma, and sleeping with the lights on for years well. I was finding my symptoms easing and being easier to deal with in late 2019 thanks to extensive therapy and working through them one by one but then my Mom died on January 1st of this year right after midnight. 

It was the simple call and “we regret to inform you,” no. We had went to visit her in ICU. ICU had become a normal occurrence in the infections she kept having but she always bounced back. 

When we walked in, she didn’t seem any worse than the times before... and then a nurse pulled me to the side to tell me it was bad bad. 

I still didn’t believe it, but while we were there they said they were putting her on a ventilator, and I decided to stay the night. 

Due to my moms infection and my slight germaphobia, I didn’t feel comfortable holding her hand or being in cough range. Even before the ventilator, she couldn’t respond more than panicked eyes that never looked directly at me and hoarse “help me”’s between breaths. I couldn’t get her attention even when I did try to tell her it’d be okay and to comfort her. Seeing her like that was crushing me. I decided to let the nurses do their thing while I wished everyone on my social media a happy new year. 

The nurses came in and out to add meds and such to help her breathe, kicked me out to put the ventilator in, but when I was allowed back in they never were gone for more than 10 minutes. I watched my moms machine, and it didn’t stop beeping since we had gotten there but that was normal when o2 levels are below 90. 

She started calming down some so I laid down to sleep. I was checking my phone one last time for the night when a nurse came RUNNING in. 
The machine hadn’t made a different sound or anything but apparently my mother’s heart had stopped. 

Within seconds the room got filled with folks providing CPR. A doctor came in and told me to tell her if I wanted them to stop. 

5 minutes passed, then 7, then 10. It didn’t feel like I though. I’m just sitting there in shock and unsure what to do. The doctor informs me her ribs are broken and if she does suddenly make it she’s gonna be in a ton of pain but at this point we were just torturing her. 

Blood was in her breathing tube. Her eyes looked gone. I told them to stop. 

I remember feeling super numb and floaty. I hadn’t slept in months. My boyfriend wasn’t answering the phone and I didn’t know what the fuck to do but it didn’t matter because I couldn’t think. 

Eventually I just allowed the numb to take over. I had hoped that numb would stay for a bit but starting around February, I started waking up every night at 12:23 no matter when I go to sleep. 

I know why it’s happening, but at the same time, I just can’t get it under control. 

Once I’m awake I can’t go back to sleep until daylight and it’s getting real old. No matter what I take I’ll wake up. 

Luckily my job has been shut down over the Covid stuff, but I’m worried about when I do have to work again. 

Has anyone else dealt with this?

On Jan. 30, 2018 I became a survivor of murder-suicide.

Facts were written in the media, case files, autopsy reports and death certificates. They were illustrated with crime scene photos and national news headlines.

Breadcrumbs of truth built the narrative for me, never telling the full story.

There are 11 murder-suicides each week in the United States, often in military and veteran communities. Why aren’t we talking about this publicly beyond sensationalized headlines that don’t help solve the problem?

The lack of support, information, and humanization led me to believe nobody *should* be talking about it. I felt voiceless and carried significant guilt and shame because of the stigmatized circumstances.

I’m taking back the narrative. As a survivor of murder-suicide, I am more than a murderer’s daughter.

My writing will add to the national conversation on mental health and veteran post-traumatic stress disorder. I hope my story will educate the public and help survivors of this type of tragedy to know they are not alone; the shame is not theirs to carry as they navigate their complex journey.

If you are a survivor of murder-suicide, or know somebody who is looking for support, please consider following my blog here: [www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com](https://www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com). I am connecting with researchers and fellow survivors to reduce the stigma on this awful experience, and help other survivors.

So, this is a reallllyyyy long story, but about two years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy who I found out was lying to me and who I'm pretty certain was manipulating me. (Despite his mom and friend telling me he was manipulative and that I should stay away.) Anywho, he was very mentally ill and seeking counseling, but I think he should've gone to a residential treatment facility. Alas, he was in his twenties and no one could force him. 

Anyways, I have nightmares about seeing him now and I wake up feeling so panicked and anxious for a while. He would get into these extreme rages after fights with his mom, and he once told me he wanted to kill her. I was horrified, but he was acting very different than normal, so I talked him out of it. 

We eventually went our separate ways and he lives very far away from me, but I still fear he will find me and hurt me, tho he never made any kind of threat against or was even mean to me. But I don't trust him at all. He also has a relationship with a new girl (she looks similar to me and his past girls in several ways, creepy) and honestly just the thought of it makes me sick. 

Oh, and the story is worse, considering he went thru basically a psychotic break and for a couple of weeks I thought he would kill himself, but I won't get into it. 

I'm in a happy relationship now with a man that I trust very much and who is incredibly kind, so I know I am safe. I just hate that I still deal with these dreams and fears.

I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his ""voice"". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend ""Jay's"" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.

The next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with ""Jay"". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.

Back when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. 



I knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. 


Earlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a ""shooting in the woods"" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. 

And then this happened.

I'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.

I don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know."

62aa1fefabb116cb465a45fc	2434_ptsd	"(TW) A bad sexual experience when I was 18 still affects me, I’m not sure if I was traumatized Okay, I’m going to preface this by saying that I did have a moderately traumatic childhood, I want to contextualize things in hopes to give better insight. 
I grew up in a turbulent and dysfunctional environment, I was also tormented by my peers growing up and endured profound alienation and loneliness. My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I’ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they’d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn’t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn’t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. 

When I was 18 (I’m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.

On my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me. We met up and drove around, hung out at his place and divulged in deep conversations for hours on end. 

After a couple of times he became very flirtatious and made a pass at me. 
I was pretty sexually inexperienced and he knew that, in hindsight I feel as though  he fetishized my innocence (he casually) brought it up countless times. When we first started hooking  up , it was pretty vanilla and ..normal I guess.


Overtime he began to become really aggressive and rough , he was kind of coercive and disregarded some of my boundaries. He would choke me so hard to where I would run out of air and the next day my neck would be riddled with bruises (I was okay with choking but not that extreme). I have a visceral memory of how dark and sinister his eyes looked while he would do this. 

On one occasion he did something  I did NOT consent too and it really upset me, I consented you’re sex but not what he did in the midst of it(I don’t feel comfortable being less vague ) it wasn’t I’ve isolated thing, but during that instance I remember spacing out until it was over with..was paralyzed and couldn’t think. He took me home and gave the impression he was oblivious and things were fine ,  I didn’t tell him what I was feeling. I felt stupid because I am partially responsible for putting myself in a compromising position and allowing myself to be taken  advantage of, I also had such little value in myself that I didn’t want him to stop seeing me. After a while he ghosted me, and I was devastated. I was angry and felt used and beat myself up over it for a while. 

He also dated a string of girls around my age, I didn’t find that off until it was over though. 

I didn’t tell anyone about this, I didn’t want my parents to find out or to be judged but I feel like this was a tipping point into my descent of substance abuse and depression. 
There were so many other things that contributed 
To my depression manifesting and festering over time and this wasn’t the worst thing that happened to me per-say but it was the straw that broke the camels back. 

I haven’t had sex in 2 years  I don’t date and I wish that I could go back In time and stop everything from happening. I wish I could scrub it from my mind entirely but I can’t and I still have dreams about the whole ordeal. 


Any advice on how to open up about this to a therapist, I’ve always felt too embarrassed to. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to have or want s relationship and It sucks."

5f3d6ca05772161108bc0e2e	2288_ptsd	"Treatment Well after finishing 12 weeks of a trauma therapy program, I’m going to go away to “residential” treatment. I was like “wtf,” is this even voluntary? Turns out it is. I could have stayed home and continued trying to fix myself. I completed a trauma level 1 program and opted to go the intensive route by completing the next step the right way. I have to be away from everyone and can’t have electronics. I will miss you, Reddit! 
I finished the program I was in with many women who are vets or have husbands serving. I think this was the key for me to really accept my PTSD. I didn’t fully absorb it before seeing these women react to situations and explain their emotions the way I did. We’re not crazy. We aren’t “overly emotional.” You give an asthmatic an inhaler for a reason. You give someone with severe, chronic PTSD skills to avoid panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares for the same reason; in that regard, its all the same. Trauma itself is much like pain: you can’t compare it. It is what it is. When you’re stuck in fight or flight mode, you need to learn skills to turn it off. This is through DBT. I have been panic attack free for awhile now, have not had self harming thoughts, or any other “crazy” feeling that could potentially occur due to PTSD. It’s all brain damage.
Most trauma treatment is voluntary, and you need to find them on your own. I highly recommend each of you find a psychologist- not a “therapist” to treat PTSD. My trauma occurred in my childhood. My psychologist now treats adults, but many of us were abused as children. His background is working with dyfus cases and treating children. Get a good psychiatrist you can trust- I am on 6 medications: 2 for nightmares and sleep, 2 for anxiety, and 2 for depression. NO ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDS BECAUSE IM NOT CRAZY.
PTSD is brain damage, and that’s how it needs to be treated.
I’m extremely mistrusting of the system and had to do this all my way. My husband is a great support, and I know many of you don’t have the support you need. I’m praying for you.
I hit the lottery when I found my psychologist. He wanted me to face my trauma last year by doing this, and I couldn’t because I knew i wasn’t ready. 2 years after starting therapy, I had the courage to do this.
My point is; no matter what state or insurance you have, it’s your responsibility to take care of your mental health to the best of your ability and capacity. 
I wish you all the best as I say bye to Reddit and begin the next chapter in my journey. Going to the west coast VOLUNTARILY so I can leave behind some mistrust, anger, and worry and do what I need to do the right way - no visitors, no contact 30 days. Feels like jail for my broken mind 😩🤪😅🥰

I'm sorry if this is a long post, there's a lot of backstory and context

So, it's my first time posting, and I just wanted to share with everyone the progress I made last session

I have PTSD from sexual abuse doing my childhood, and only got to find out last year because somehow something unlocked the memories from my brain that were repressed all this time and I remembered it.

I started EMDR to treat it, and when I started I felt like I couldn't do much progress cause I thought ""Im already over it and I have come to accept it"" even though I was having severe symptoms.

A few months passed and I broke down cause I realized I haven't accepted it, and I have never let myself feel the pain, I was still in denail, but it wasn't really fully accepted yet, I started griefing but somehow I was unsure if I invented it myself, I have multiple mental illnesses, that are product of the trauma, and I have been diagnosed with PTSD by multiple professionals but I just wasn't sure if it was true, like I rationally knew the abuse happened and have multiple symptoms, but there was a part of me that couldn't be convinced that I didn't made up the memories and the trauma.

Every time during my sessions when the therapist asked me when picturing the memories what I felt I always said ""anger and disgust"", and then I got a block and couldn't picture the memories anymore.
My therapist explained that I couldn't see them anymore cause once agian it was too hard for me to remember, and that I didn't believed I didn't made it up cause it was still very hard for me to accept that the abuse actually happened to me.

Last week during session when we started I could picture the trauma agian and got really distressed, we stopped and my therapist asked me what we're my feelings, and this time, for the fist time I felt anxious and scared, then I finally told her, ""I didn't made it up, my grandfather did in fact abused me, it did happend to me"". For the first time I fully accepted it and finally believed myself that I didn't made it up as an excuse to my other disorders.

She got really happy and also did I, it was so wonderful to not doubt myself anymore, it was reliefing and she said that this was the biggest breakthrough we've done so far and that now things will get easier and better, I just wanted to share with all of you, it gets better, take care ❤️.

She had two children, a daughter my age and a son who was in middle/high school. The daughter was my best friend at the time and the son was mentally challenged. He would lure me into his room by playing the ""Barbie Girl"" song by Aqua, I loved Barbies. The mother would always make him take me to the bathroom, even though I knew where it was. He would touch me and force me to touch him. I still remember how cramped the space was and how he would stand in the stall with me while I went to the bathroom. I still remember how hot his penis always was. The babysitting stopped when I came home one day and told my mom that he had shoved his tongue in my mouth/down my throat. But neither of my parents knew the extent of the abuse until I was in middle school, half a state away.

Recently, I've come to the age where I should be getting a regular physical. The thought of opening my legs to anyone, let alone my female doctor, horrifies me to an extent I've never been frightened before. Even before she could explain anything, I was in tears and shaking uncontrollably. The speculum looks like a weapon to me. Even the thought of being in a hospital gown scares me. She says that I don't need to have one, but I want to have children and getting a physical is the first step to understanding my full health spectrum. I'm in therapy because I couldn't go through with the physical, and I still haven't been able to do it one year later. She won't put me out for it and only offers me ibuprofen and xanax.

Last night, even just thinking about the physical had me shaking and in tears. I curled up in a ball and closed my legs as tight as I could. Even now, typing this, I have my legs crossed tight. I think the son of my babysitter must have done more to me than just touching. I don't know how to cope with this. I'm still a virgin and have never had a real boyfriend. The last guy that tried to have sex with me was very insistent and I wasn't ready. He was disappointed and stopped talking to me when I pushed him away and accused him of only wanting me for sex. I want to have kids and I want to have sex, but I want to have them with someone I trust and love and who loves and trusts me back. I also have a horrible gag reflex and fear of blowjobs. I know that talking to my therapist is the best way to work through all of this but I have other issues that have taken precedence at the moment. I guess I just wanted to have the idea somewhere and vent a little. Thanks for allowing me to let this go into the void.

5f3d6ca05772161108bc0e2e	1964_ptsd	"Recently Diagnosed So yesterday I had my mental health feedback with the psychologist at my city’s youth wellness centre and I got diagnosed with two mental health disorders.

The first one which I was expecting (due to my background in psych) was Illness Anxiety Disorder which is what I’ve been diagnosed with. It means that I tend to think of the worse when it comes to any little physical symptom I have and it can panic attacks. 

Now this is where I was surprised with the second diagnosis. I was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which I did not expect at all. I was in literal shock and felt like, “wait, but I only had one traumatic experience in my life, how can I have PTSD” and I didn’t realize that all my intrusive memories, avoidance of areas, social events and certain types of people, hell my negative changes in my mood, behaviour and way of thinking is because of this.

Now, I’m not going to list my trauma because it’s NSFW, and I merely just wanna talk about my reaction to my diagnosis because I’m still in shock and processing it.

But I honestly thought I was depressed. Not traumatized. I honestly kept minimizing my pain because I believed that people have gone through worse things than me but for something that I have gone through to affect my behaviour and cognition to the point it affects my daily routine is still shocking.

I don’t know how to feel about this to be honest. I didn’t even expect this."

5f3d6ca05772161108bc0e2e	1986_ptsd	"Everything triggers flashbacks, crying every day I’m 23 years old, and last year in April my 15 year old brother hung himself in his closet. 
We were best friends, partners in crime. We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. 
I was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn’t feel like I was getting better. 
I was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn’t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. 
I saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I’m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. 
I’ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. 
My medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. 
It’s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can’t handle my grief, I can’t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It’s absolutely horrible. 
I’m a hairdresser and I’ll have clients say certain words to me like “hang” “closet” “died/death” “brother” or make jokes about suicide even though it’s completely out of context I’ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It’s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don’t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. 
I hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can’t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. 
It is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I’m not ready to explain to the people around me what I’m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. 
It’s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don’t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. 

I can’t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I’m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn’t like me. Advance on getting over that fear would be so appreciated because I KNOW I need some serious therapy right now and my family tells me all the time. Does anyone have any good skills in these areas? Please help me. I’m suffering and I know damn well I can’t go through the rest of my life like this. 

TLDR — My baby brother committed suicide last year, and I ended up developing PTSD from it; I have been having extreme flashbacks and my therapist stopped treating me due to my diagnosis.

I can hardly manage any exercise at all due to this but to have those two specifically repeatedly suggested and praised and healing when it's the opposite for me. I don't know how to convey it.

5cb4bee5ffdc1d0016bbd019	2180_ptsd	"""Oh hell no! It came back"" a mixture of fireworks and stress. (vent) This will be a brief account of the last few weeks and what it culminated in. Over the last couple of weeks, fireworks have been going off all over my part of town. Often, the people who are doing it set them off late at night 1 or 2 am.  My PTSD, after an incident with people throwing fireworks and a near riot, is triggered by fireworks, bright lights, loud sounds and people in a confined space. I have for the last two years kept this under wraps with a few problems along the way like zoning out or feeling rising panic in some situations, as well as some sensor issues.  


Either way, back to the fireworks in my town. With the fireworks at night, I have found that if I start my bed rutin again or get a specific fluffy blanket I can usually calm and soothe myself to sleep.  However a few days ago, just before New Year's eve as I was walking from the bus station after dropping my friends off, I noticed some kids running towards me. Thinking they were running to the bus I sidestepped out the way and kept going. Then it happened, I was close to coming round the corner and then ""bang"". A big flash of red light and sparks flew from around the corner. My first reaction was to stand still and as the last kid past me, I struggled not to grab onto him. My next reaction was to feel like crying. Which after a brief feeling of outer bodyness turned into a need for a smoke. I recently, and frustratingly, bought a packet of cigarets due to the bangs and the stress they were causing me. After that I then got back did the washing and tried to call the police non-emergency line to no avail, gave up and drank some whiskey. This obviously was a bad idea and just made me feel even worse. The follow on from that was to clean like a maniac.  


Roll on new year's eve and fireworks are everywhere, people on squares and roadsides. I was with my friend so it was a little better. At our party it seemed to miss a lot of the fireworks, We saw the new year in and crashed.  The day after new year's day, everything came crashing down. My reaction to stress was to just sleep and after I tried to get some work done I just broke down and smoked all my cigarettes. The stress and isolation this brought just hit me with a large hammer. Why was it like this? Who could I contact?. I tried contacting one of my friends and gave up. Then a feeling of needing to get out of this came about me and I got scared. I knew I had alcohol at home and that was a risk. So I ended up ringing my friend and ask them to be an accountablöity buddy for the night, as I was scared  I was going to go on a binge.   


Today, after writing this out I have eaten which was hard to do over the last few days and I have finished tidying. It feels like releasing some of this crap and meditating has helped.

Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching.  When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.

5cb4bee5ffdc1d0016bbd019	2430_ptsd	"Having a hard time opening up to loved ones TW for all of this (rape, assault)

I’m 20 years old, female. When I was freshly 16, I was raped during a party in a small apartment, with the door open, and nobody helped me. I began acting out and getting in a lot of trouble after this, ultimately landing myself in acute inpatient for suicidal thoughts. I wrote my parents a letter telling them what happened to me, and social workers had to come in the hospital and report it with me. They never, ever contacted me or my parents EVER again. That alone is its own damage. 
2 years later, freshly 18 now, I began working as a houseman in a hotel. This means I cleaned everything except for inside the actual rooms. Well, there was a man that would stay Monday-Thursday for his construction job. He took an interest in me quickly, asking my age, where I go to school, then progressing into telling me I have “beautiful bedroom eyes” and “pure ness in my smile” I knew he was up to something. He then began asking me which car is mine, when do I get off work, will my parents be waiting on me to come home from work tonight, etc. I began to be paranoid even when I left work, getting trapped in moments of my 16 year old self, thinking nobody cares what would happen to me, because after all, the police don’t care about me.  At one point he entered the lady’s restroom where I was cleaning, had me in a corner, touched my arm and asked how I like the new job. :( 
One day, and this is so hard for me to tell because it became a repressed memory until my second hospitalization in October 2019, I was vacuuming the second floor hallway. Humming to myself probably, at the very start of this floor, the door to my left opened quickly. An arm, with orange hair and freckles, oh my god this is it, an arm grabs me. It was the man. He held me just inside the room, my left foot in the doorway. He told me to look in his eyes, gripped my arm tighter, and held me there. I was thinking to myself that this is it, he has me. He could’ve done whatever he wanted. It felt like my eyes were looking into his for years, and his eyes, they were like... glass. Empty, yet fiery.  My mind made me see myself, naked, beaten, raped, and left all alone in the woods to rot. He let me go and I finished my shift. I was in a state of denial, showing up to my following shift in the morning. When I got to the second floor again, I actually passed out, and I’ve never passed out! I completely fell to the ground, it felt like I swallowed a rock. 
Long story, but my entire 2018 consisted of horrible paranoid thoughts and migraines, but I had forgotten this incident for a long time, so my therapist and I had a hard time getting it under control. Now that I remember, my life is bad. I have also borderline personality disorder that causes me MUCH distress on a daily basis, but now I’m miserable. I have flashbacks during the day time, I can’t even take the trash out alone. I’ve lost all my friends. My relationships are shallow and meaningless, except for my boyfriend. I never feel safe. I have gotten to the point of accusing my father of trying to rape me (absolutely delusional, he’s never touched me) and had similar accusations to my friends and even my boyfriend at some points. Sometimes, when the flashbacks are bad and I can’t afford to buy my medical marijuana, I get stuck in loops of seeing my dead and raped body again. It’s horrible. I’m scared to tell my family what happened because it seems like... nothing happened. Nothing happened but I spend everyday asking myself if this existence is even fucking worth it.

TLDR; I already told my family about a trauma, and now I feel this new trauma is not enough to trouble them over. Or trouble myself over anymore."

I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that ""traditional college experience."" Truth is, I really hate it. I was diagnosed with PTSD at the end of 2018, alongside depression and anxiety. My trauma happened in February of 2018, so it is pretty fresh and still hurts. It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. 

My other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the ""Traditional college experience"" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week. It might be a long shot that anyone has experience with this. Regardless, can anyone give me some help/advice/reassurance? I'm not sure what to do.

I have a lot of trauma. A very unstable upbringing and three separate accounts of sexual abuse, two of those instances were performed by family members when I was a child and the third when I was 18 years old. I have been working very hard in therapy (once a week for three years) and feel like I’ve finally broken really important ground on the unstable childhood aspect. I think that my body and my brain have made enough room for me to start really dealing with the sexual trauma in a big way. And it is ruining my life. 

I’ve found that my more recent symptoms with vivid flashbacks and memories that were foggy before is a VERY intense dizziness. It is completely debilitating. I cannot drive, leave the couch - anything. I feel like I’m going to be sick if I try. The dizziness has occurred before, but never like this. 

I need advice on how to bounce back. I’ve tried appealing the young parts by watching TV shows from my childhood (this usually works, but isn’t now). I’ve tried drinking water. I’ve tried grounding exercises. But I am still unable to move. Does anyone have any advice?

i still deal with PTSD like symptoms such as strong twitching when thinking about my past or very sad subjects. im especially sensitive to things like that. if im at work im distant from others and if left with time to wander in my thoughts, i will think about dark stuff and flinch very noticeably - and others might ask why i do that. it's embarrassing but at other times i feel completely okay, even happy, can function for days no problem. i even have the habit a bit contradictory to the sad thought flinch - just thinking of little jokes and i'll laugh out loud - and of course that's embarrassing to as i seem like a crazy person to my co-workers. i guess i have a strong pendulum of emotion and react strongly to it. other times its long bouts of apathy. 


so im thinking about getting therapy / help again. but even looking around on websites and thinking about getting that help upsets me. i flinch pretty hard but not even on certain hard memories, just vague memories of the multiple occasions when i had a bad time in my past. i think PTSD, if i really do have it, probably blurred my memory on certain bad things. i also can't find any good info on this stuff. i don't know if i should get therapy or not either - money is a problem for me and therapy brings out the worst emotions. i don't want to feel those bad emotions, its very painful.

5cb4bee5ffdc1d0016bbd019	2036_ptsd	"Could I have PTSD? Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.

So after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.

As I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.


So here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:

Some years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.

All this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.

Then after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.

Some time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.

Before all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.

Now after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. 

So my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?

650affc9502d6cbe607d5a7b	1664_ptsd	"Experiencing flashbacks and dissociation? Hi, my name is Liz and I'm a 30 year old woman with a lot of past trauma. Specifically, most of the trauma happened when I was a child living with parents who were abusive to one another and myself. I seem to be having flashbacks to things that have happened in my current relationship though. My partner likes to drink and I do not. I have no problem with anyone drinking around me, it's just that I don't find pleasure in it myself. He has acted in very scary and mean ways while drinking, and even though it has been over a year since he has done anything like this, I seem to be having issues. I lay in bed and sometimes have memories (that prior I didn't remember, or hadn't thought of in a long time) and they feel real. For example: he screamed in my face one time, and I had a memory of it the other night. I felt his voice causing my whole body to shake and rattle. I felt my life being possibly threatened. It took quite some time to shake the residual feelings and go to sleep. 

After experiencing the flashbacks, or experiencing something he has done, I tend to dissociate. At least I think it's dissociation. I actually welcome it and LIKE the feeling. I just kind of go away. I can't see what's in front of me or hear what people say. I go on autopilot or just stare into nothingness. It almost feels like maybe I'm going cross-eyed, lol. But no one has confirmed this for me. Although, as a child, my teachers would accuse me of ""daydreaming"" all the time. I would try to explain to my mom that I wasn't ""thinking"" of anything. I was just in a daze. She said, well whatever it is, just cut it out, lol. 

I like this feeling of being numb or calm and unaware. Is that unusual? Are these signs of PTSD? I really am not sure and just looking for some answers and possibly some people out there who are going through the same.  Most of the time I hear people describe dissociation as an unwanted or unpleasant thing. So, I'm a little confused as to why I welcome the sensation. (Most of the time, unless I'm trying to do something important)

I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I hope you are doing well during these difficult times.

650affc9502d6cbe607d5a7b	2333_ptsd	"Terrified of what a therapist would say to me about this all I'll leave this as a trigger warning for a few things




To keep this part quick and simple, my family life is terrible and quite terrifying, to say the least, and I'm sure this has played a very large part, but that's not quite what I'm wanting to bring up.
I don't want to call this PTSD, no, definitely not.
I feel as though this can never be on that ""level"" I suppose, in a way.
I know things like this can't be on a scale, but that's just what it feels like.
I feel like if I were to go to a therapist, I'll have my fears that this all was just me overreacting, confirmed, which isn't a bad thing you know, but just for this, I just don't know how I would react.
I'd probably feel dreadful for wasting their time, for one. 
All of this panicking and crap for what's deemed as something so small.
I don't want to call this abuse, or toxic. I can't do that because it doesn't feel like that, speaking from an emotional standpoint.
I guess I'll just say it was really bad.
Not so long ago, I broke up with a girl who i guess you could say wasn't the best.
She kind of treated me like crap, made me feel like everything was my fault.
Even looking back and knowing it wasn't, a part of me feels so guilty for something I know wasn't my doing[yet it still feels so].
She disregarded my feelings, then up and left for about three months, putting quite a bit in front of me, which I could understand at first.
You can't put everything on hold for one person, and I could understand that even at 13-14.(ive just turned 16 a few months ago)
It was online, so it's not like she could've drove near me and do anything, but that really didn't make me any less terrified everytime I saw messages of her being blatantly angry with me, being upset with soemthing I might've done wrong or said.
We never called much, which I suppose I'm thankful for, but the times we did, I guess it was okay.
I guess I was terrified of what my parents would think, given they weren't (still kind of aren't) the most supportive.
My father was upset when I came out, being that he couldn't quite accept that I'm gay.
She led me on though, and for a while.
She was really upset when I wouldn't just accept her confession and that she wanted to go out, so i guess I kind of forced myself to liking her just a bit.
It all kind of felt rushed, but I was truly in love with her, despite the fact that others would probably say it was just puppy love(I imagine for good reason).
She kind of made me think my friends were the bad ones, like she was in the right.
I gave her three chances, and I accepted her with no hesitation for every one of those.
I have flashbacks almost every day, I'm kind of terrified to do much or go anywhere near that reminds me of her.
I can't even say her name without breaking down.
I've had at least three panic attacks, one being in school to which the teacher had to escort me out and I had to go home.
This may be a bit disorganised, and I'm really sorry about that, but my brain is a bit jumbled and I guess this isn't the easiest to think and talk about.
This wouldn't be so hard if I didn't hear her, if I didn't see her in my head everytime.
The flashbacks aren't just flashbacks to me you know, they literally drag me in to a point at which I'm choking and trying to get out.
I tend to panic and not get ""out"" of it for a while, and I more often than not, dissociate from my body in a way so it seems.
I would go into depth a bit more, but I've been told that's what I do whenever I panic that way by an old therapist.
The memories aren't really in order, and I don't think I can remember specific things because they're going so fast, maybe?...
I don't think fast is the right word, but they're kind of just thrown at me all at once.
I can phsycially feel her, hear her sometimes, and being shizoafective doesn't help at all.
I'm so utterly frustrated at the fact that I'm unable to let go, but I don't think my family would deem it ""normal"" for me to say that there are memories holding me down or anything like that.
They wouldn't really understand, unfortunately.
I haven't told anyone about this but a friend who has been here from beginning to now with this whole ordeal, given my family's reaction won't be anywhere near supportive.
I'm going to a placement centre sometime soon, but I don't know when.
I'm terrified that I'm just overreacting, you know.
I'm terrified that a part of me just ""wants"" this in a way, like I deserve this.
Again, I really apologise for the mess, I'm not the most organised when it comes to my emotions and such.
She told me she was sorry and it was heavily implied that she, at the very least, attempted suicide.
How am I supposed to handle that?..
Everytime I think about it, I just think about the fact that this is just
It's nothing compared to something else so much worse.
She could've been here, you know?..
Phsycially been here, but she wasn't.
I know comparing isn't a thing of suggestion with something like this, but I have such a habit and compulsion to do exactly that.
I feel as though my problems and this is nothing whatsoever.
I feel pathetic for even being so distraught over it.
I'll probably delete this because I wouldn't want anyone finding this and making connections, if anyone I know happen to find this.
I really apologise for this though, I hope I'm not taking up anyone's important time."

In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. 

Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didn’t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned.

If I don’t take pills, I can’t sleep for more then 2 hours. Not good sleep, I dream of that accident. I see it while I’m awake. I am scared to hell to go back work in my field. It is not that I don’t want to work. I don’t want to do this.

But at the same time, I see so much people who get way more injured then me. And they are going back to what they were doing like it is nothing.

I’m so sorry if you’re happy, and I’m sorry if you’re excited for the future. I’m sorry if you’re so comfortable with who you share your life with, I’m sorry I allowed that. I’ve been carrying guilt for years that I granted him the freedom to do this to another individual, and that I was so scared to open up about what occurred four years ago. 

You’re going to find out soon, and you’re not going to believe it at first. You’re going to be told bluntly, and you will reject it. Perhaps you’ve already been told, by his friends that are no longer his friends for a reason that you should know by now. I couldn’t comprehend it either, not at first. I didn’t understand what information I had just been handed, what it meant and what it was doing to me. Four years later I am still processing what it was and who he is. It still weighs on me as heavy as it did that night, but in a different way.

I mourned my relationship first, I had succumbed to what I thought was love, but was ultimately masterful manipulation. He made it easy to attach myself to him with promises of an appealing future. He had a way of convincing me he was smarter than me, and everyone else. You’ll be okay if you stick with me, the rest of the world is toxic and confused. We’re okay if we just stay here. I love you because you’re practical, you’re not like any other girl I’ve dated. They’re all crazy, you’re sane. You’re grounded, and you pay half of the rent. 

He was secretive to start, a few early discrepancies regarding other girls online. Inexperienced me deemed this normal, we could moved passed all of that noise - what counted was where we ended up each night. He kept nude images of these girls on his phone, we were not off to a great start. But I was practical, I was different, and I made him feel smart. I existed to embellish him, an important role - and he knew it. I was his type; insecure and accustomed to abuse. This particular trauma, however, is not abuse. Though there was plenty, emotional and physical abuse. I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it. He shoved me into a wall when I announced his lack of masculinity too loudly. 

He worked in security at a ballet school, often overnight. Based on the mistrust that was instilled in me early on in our relationship, the overnight work worried me. Is he talking to girls? Is he sending them unsolicited dick pics? Probably. By this point he had convinced me it was in my head, and I was massively paranoid. I was turning into one of the girls he didn’t want to be around, someone insane and impractical. But I paid rent, and contributed towards the idea of a future. I was being molded into someone who would love him no matter what doubts I had. 

He had some performance issues come up at his job. I can’t remember what they were regarding, or if they were even real…But he lost his full time position. He maintained employment with the same company at a different location, part-time. We got by with savings and my serving job. I got a call one day from his manager, Patrick. They had originally tried to call him, and I was listed as his emergency contact. It was not the first time I had received a call from his work, so I didn’t think much of it. I was at work when he called so he left a voicemail - I listened to it on my way home from work. He spoke as if he were talking to him, instructing him to call him back - and that they had to cut into all of the lockers at his previous workplace. He listed off a few of the items found in the lockers and wanted to be sure that they were his, and make sure everything was accounted for. There was a laptop, and a safe box. 

I asked him about these items but he assured me they weren’t his. I let it go, as I had many things during our time together. He was picking up a few evening shifts where he could at this time, quite sporadically. He would leave around 2 or 4, and return around 10pm. I got cut from work when the dinner shift showed up, around 4:30. I left work, walked south on Bay Street, east on College, and hopped on the northbound train. I got home around 5:15pm. I unloaded, changed into sweats, the usual. Cleaning was pretty relaxing after a day in the service industry, so I went to grab some supplies under the kitchen sink cupboard. Our kitchen counters were L shaped, and I always thought it was weird that where the space under the cupboard should have ended, it extended passed where the wall above sat. This particular evening I noticed that this was not the case, and somehow the wall had moved forward. I was frightened, I was one of those people that ready creepy stories at night - you know the one where people discover there are people living in small spaces in their home. 

It wasn’t the wall, it was a piece of bristol board. It was relieving for a brief moment - but that relief was short lived. I removed that board and discovered a safe and a laptop. Since that moment I’ve really repressed what I found - through denial or embarrassment, I’ve somehow forgotten in detail what it was I had seen. I still don’t know what journey I set out to after that moment, but it wasn’t to deal with seeing those images. That was my second mistake. My first was my initial thought - the end of my four year relationship. Logic was not present, logic would have been to immediately call the police - instead of waiting for him to come home to confront him about it.* 

If he somehow sees this - he will frantically come up with something to tell you to convince you I am just some crazy ex-girlfriend out to get me for breaking up with me. Or perhaps he has already set something in place to manipulate you into believing that none of this is truth, and anything anyone ever says apart from him is a lie. When I left Toronto, he covered his tracks - and somehow convinced his family and our mutual friends that I was not to be trusted. He was fine, and merely unhappy in our relationship. He never got the help he claimed to seek, he paused his search for child pornography, but not for long. It’s never for very long. Damaged people don’t get better without proper treatment. 

I think about this every fucking day. It’s with me, for better or for worse. I think about the children who attended and lived at the ballet school that he worked at - it’s such a privilege for them to be there, a dream. I think about the children that were trafficked and exploited - contributing to his sick obsession. I think about the women who are trafficked in Southern Ontario. I think about his other ex-girlfriend who also knew about this. I think about his family who are under his false influence. But most of all, I think of you.

It feels debilitating, i worry whenever the radio plays in public because if it plays i will have a panic attack, it is horrible. 
My boyfriend now is the most caring and sweet guy and he is fully aware of the situation and the song, and he has seen the reaction i have to the song.

Recently though, i have found myself randomly thinking of the song and it gets stuck in my head - causing me to panic and get extremely anxious.

The worst part of the story is that now she’s fine and I’m struggling with PTSD, panic disorder and depression. I’ve been secretly ashamed of how ”easily” I got fucked up so bad.

6659a0cba146414f09ff470b	2372_ptsd	"Sudden realization has shook me as a person (note: I know diagnosis posts are not allowed. I am not requesting that. I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent/ramble/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)

I had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. 

I've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. 

Nope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. 

And then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then ""wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?"" 

And then the floodgates started to open. 

*  ""Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable""      
* ""Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.""      
* ""I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me. All two of the physical fights I have been in, have been with him when he was in the house and I snapped after he wouldn't leave despite me begging mom to have him leave""      
* ""What are the other symptoms of ptsd? (googles) ... disturbed sleep? ..."" (i am a violent sleeper. i dont put sheets on anymore as they 100% always are ripped off as i thrash in my sleep""     
* ""and... shouting in your sleep? ......"" (no conscious memory, but apparently every night i shout out things. my mom doesnt mention it much anymore unless it was a bad night, but whenever i share a hotel with someone I wake up to ""why were you shouting ""stop go away stop"" at 3 AM?"")           
* ""what else cou- nightmares too?"" (never related to trauma in a way i can discern, but have nightmares that wake me up screaming in about 1/3 sleeps)             
* ""exaggerated startle response? Does that mean what I think? ... Yes. ... fuck..."" (its not quite as severe anymore but i used to invariably freak out if someone touched me without me seeing it. My dad(never hit me, never abused me, was the chill parent) used to poke me in the car at random, just jokingly. I would flinch and recoil every time. Eventually I got to a point where I would sit pushed against the passenger side door to try and get away from it. He asked me at the time why I flinched and got scared, he never hit me. I didnt know why I did that but I couldnt stop. Now I dont do well with people touching me at random, surprising noises, loud bangs, sirens and fire alarms)   

It was like I was looking at a connect the dots, and the dots were all in a straight line in numerical order. I got deeply confused. Why hadn't I ever talked to my psychiatrists about this? Why didn't I realize I have flashbacks weekly or more? Why didn't I realize hearing aggressive shouting is very prone to do this, even from strangers in public, or in film/tv? Why didn't I realize my reaction to the memory or presence of my moms abuser far exceeds what is normal? Why did I not connect my hatred of his face, Heineken, the smell of spilled beer, or his cologne with this? How did I never admit this? Any of this? Why did I always deny I had trauma issues or dodge the question so deftly, all the while completely unconscious of what I was dodging? What the fuck do I do now? 

I feel like I wasn't hurt badly enough. I wasn't the direct target of any of his violence until I was an adult. It wasn't sexual or combat related. It didn't ruin my life(depression did that for me) like my friend, who I knew disassociates for hours and wakes up multiple times nightly from the nightmares. I feel guilty for even considering it, but I detect too many characteristics that line up for me to ignore it. I'm making an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I've been seeing psychiatrists for 9 years by now and I've never done this. 

My sense of self and my understanding of my mental health has been destroyed. I feel like I was assembling a jigsaw puzzle of myself, was mostly done, and perhaps 40% of the puzzle just got torn off, mixed up, and the pieces thrown across the floor. I've always felt that if nothing else, I knew what happens to my brain. I thought it has been the same for years now. That there wasn't more to discover, just need to work more therapy and cope better. But there's been a giant red neon sign saying ""THESE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS YOU DOLT"" here the whole time and I've been blind to it. What else could I have missed? How deep does this trauma stuff run? How am I supposed to self evaluate when I can apparently never be objective about these things? What use is talking about ones symptoms if I managed to perfectly lie to myself and to my doctors and therapists for all of these years?

It's so plainly obvious, I think I must have subconsciously been refusing to accept it. To protect.. something. That's why I think I was able to take off the blinders about this when I was uninhibited through the drugs I took to calm down. Its my only thought I've managed to come up with regarding why I never saw the plainly obvious truth, and instead unconsciously denied and avoided, with expert skill, connecting the symptoms to trauma. Even the flashbacks. I always just thought I was being dramatic and emotional. I never had a thought about them beyond ""oh just ignore it"". Even though I knew what PTSD commonly presents as. Even though I didn't think I was hiding anything or that I would hide anything like this. 

I'm talking to my psychiatrist soon. I don't look forward to it at all. I have a feeling it will be awful trying to say any of this. I don't even know what's next. I am not able to reduce my exposure to my triggers. I can't control him. My mom thinks I should like him and has never understood how upset I get. Even when I (of all people, never hurt a fly, never wanted to fight anyone, ever) have been so upset by his presence, combined with hearing his inescapable voice in my bedroom, that I attacked him. Two different times. I can't even type this post without crying from this. Talking. Ugh. :(

Sorry for this huge wall of text. I'm just. My brain feels like scrambled eggs. So many questions. Feel so lost about who/what I am as a person and what my mental illness means and how they affect me. It's seemingly all gone out the window and I'm put back at the start. Need to start working on writing stuff down for my appointment so I can't conveniently forget to mention it.

Hey, I'm 16 and have been dealing with PTSD since 2014 and just recently relived a very similar event and caused me to lose all my progress. Feeling lost and have no clue what to do anymore.

Back in 2014 on christmas eve I saw a man get shot and killed while shopping for a ring for my mother. I was about 11 or 12 at the time and just didn't really know how to cope or understand it so I blocked it out until around 2017 when I accepted the fact that I did/do have PTSD and tried to acknowledge and work with it more. Before then I had been diagnosed with PTSD twice but chose to ignore it, even though I would constantly have nightmares and dealt with pretty bad insomnia along with paranoia. 

I'm currently in a tiny RV park in the fucking desert and just recently had to listen to a guy getting shot to death two RVs down from my own. It destroyed any progress I had previously made and I don't even know where to go from here anymore. Ever since then I've been waking up at 2-3am because of nightmares, I constantly feel so fucking numb and on edge, it's fucking terrible. His RV is still right there and everyday I look out the window and just see it there. I feel guilty for being so affected by it because my dad saw the body and is holding it together, I can't imagine how the victim's family feels.

I can't even remember how I really started to recover from the first event, I understand that the recent event is still extremely fresh but I just hate that I have to do this all over again. Life will be life, though. Shit happens and people are still just as cruel and senseless as they've always been.
 There's many more aspects to the murder that I'm scared to open up about that are also causing me issues but all I can say is that the victim won't get justice, the system in the tiny town I'm at is fucked and corrupted.

6659a0cba146414f09ff470b	2480_ptsd	"NSFW: Diagnosed with PTSD. Root trauma from five years ago. I had a group of friends since 2004, and remained friends with them up until 2014 when I finally cut communications with them. They were a very toxic group of racist, sexist, and narcissistic people. The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. 

1. The ""leader"" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like ""You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?"". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending ""laugh"" like ""Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha."" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.
2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.
3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.
4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like ""go kill yourself no one loves you""
5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.
6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life. He was the only one I kept in more recent contact, but I noticed some of his personality traits were very similar to the group.  He would do the same mocking laugh the leader did, the same type of criticism that the leader's favorite and the white supremecist did. And at a recent party, I found out he was trying to hit on girlfriends of my friends, and made a lot of people uncomfortable. After realizing all this, I realized he is just as bad as that old group and I cut him off.

Over 5 years have passed since then, and I still think about this. I feel like I wasted so much of my potential and energy during college and feel this is part of why I'm struggling so much in the present. I think hanging out with the ""best friend"" in recent years triggered it even more, and I've been stuck in a rut for nearly a year since then.

I don't know how to find peace with this."

I know I can’t *technically* have PTSD unless you’re still displaying symptoms 1 month post-trauma, but  having a really hard time coping with it all. I know I can’t think about all the ‘what if’s’ but it’s so fucking hard not to..

My life was changed the morning of Wednesday April 10th, 2019. I am not the same person I was prior to the explosion, and it’s so fucking sad/scary/idek how to really describe it.. I was kind of a mess of a person before everything happened. Super fucking anxious and the weirdest ambivert. I avoided eye contact and got spooked easily and idk man people just make me nervous and it gets even worse in social settings. I’ve been on SSRIs for years and have seen multiple therapists and have honestly just been dealing with the highs and lows of mental illness. I’m just a research technician in an academic lab, enjoy my quiet work days and just keep to myself, while helping my bosses and post-docs with whatever’s going on that week. 

I’ll try to keep it short, but there was a natural gas explosion directly across the street from our vivarium right after my boss and I finished an experiment. As soon as he opened the door, jokingly said ‘Hmm it smells like gas. Best walk briskly so we don’t get blown up!’ I saw the construction workers across the street crowded around where I occasionally park when running late. I have a HORRIBLE sense of smell, so I was taking in the air, trying to remember what natural gas smelled like. Continuing down the sidewalk, I remember saying, ‘good thing you’re here because you know I can’t smell, I wouldn’t have had a clue!’ 

There were 2 seconds left on the crosswalk; knowing he’s a stickler with the rules I quickly paused as I watched my boss step into the road, speed walking through the white lines of the intersection. As soon as we crossed the street.. BOOM!!! 

It was almost an out of body experience, the whole thing really. The shock wave from the explosion pushed us down the sidewalk, I felt it go through my body and down the sidewalk in front of me. All of the windows outside the building next to us instantaneously shattered, raining down on us and into our eyes.. I remember looking at my boss as he screamed at me to run. 

My ears.. it was like a tornado had just ripped through my head.. then then the pounding and ringing started. I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn’t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming ‘WHAT THE FUCK’ at each other out of shock.

People starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating ‘don’t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.’ I remember the confused look on their faces..

It’s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I’m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me. If we had finished our experiment a minute later, or stayed at the crosswalk, or happened to walk at a slower pace.. it’s so fucking terrifying. I’m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. 

Begging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they’re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it’s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...

It’s only been 4 days, but it feels like it’s been an eternity. I didn’t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it’s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...

I do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. 


But at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen? It’s all so surreal and yes I’m extremely thankful to be alive, but the survivors guilt immediately crept in. I’m a trained BLS instructor, and I just ran.. I understand there was nothing I could do to save anyone, but I still feel so much guilt and shame.. 

I just needed to get it all out. Advice on moving forward is welcome/appreciated.

6659a0cba146414f09ff470b	2529_ptsd	"PTSD, or am I just over reacting? This might be triggering.

This is my first time posting here. I never really considered the possibility that I might have PTSD until very recently. I'm currently 31...when I was 19, I entered into my first real relationship. It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much. The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.

After, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be ""getting him excited"" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong... Basically, it was my fault. I lived with guilt, shame, and just overall disgust for a really long time. 

Ever since then, I have not been the same person. I lost trust in people....I can't enjoy sex....I'm afraid to date and fall in love....I'm afraid of men touching me.... I just avoid relationships and love all together. 

And that was just the first relationship. I don't even want to get into the second relationship, but he sexually violated me too. He purposely tampered with a condom to get me pregnant to keep me from transferring away to college. He thought that I'd decide to keep his baby and stay local with him. I aborted it and moved away of course. That was when I was maybe 22 or 23. That was the last relationship. I've been avoiding dating because I'm afraid of history repeating itself. I've been single ever since and honestly, I'm just lonely and depressed. I never spoke to a doctor about any of this. I don't know what I'd be diagnosed with but I'm afraid. 

Fast forward to now, there's a good person in my life who likes me. I think he's interested in me....I like him too but I'm still afraid. I don't know what to do or how to behave...I don't know what a good/healthy relationship is supposed to feel like. I'm just nervous all the time and its involuntary...I can't control how I feel. The new person said that I'm hard to read. Like, he doesn't know how I feel about physical touch... I'm sure he can tell that I'm nervous. I just don't want him to think that I'm not interested in him, or that I'm disgusted of him because that's not true. 

For a long time, I'd zone out...get lost in my thoughts. Oh, and nightmares. I'd have random nightmares of being attacked, violated, raped, assaulted, or just chased. Over the years I've been able to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, and that I shouldn't feel guilty or shameful. I tried practicing self love for a long time and I think it helped. I feel somewhat normal but I never really learned how to cope.

5ca0b46e8265280015164984	1526_counseling	I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. Divorce can be so disruptive in a child's life.I'd really need a lot more information about your situation before I'd feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions. There are so many variables, and not knowing the whole story, any advice could possibly make your situation worse.I do see some positives, though. One, you say you have a therapist. That's great! I hope you're able to talk to them about this soon. Still, they can't give you legal advice, and a lot of this situation may be dictated by the law. What your therapist can help with, though, is dealing with whatever situation you have to follow by law. If you can't change the situation, you at least need to learn how to cope with it better. Two, you're 17. When you're 18, you're legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place. Honestly, teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements. Since you didn't specify more on the situation, I have no idea what your specific situation is. Were your parents ever married? Are they separated or divorced? Was there ever a court hearing for custody? Not all couples have an official court order arrangement. All families are different, too. Was there abuse between your parents? Towards you by one of them? Does either of them have addiction issues, major health or mental health issues, or anything like that? You mentioned that you want to live with your mom, but didn't say why. Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom? Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one, or is there something else going on? This isn't a decision that should be placed entirely on you, and it also isn't a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input. But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you. Whatever you do, hang in there! 18 will be here before you know it. Focus on that. Freedom. College. Plan for your future that YOU control, and focus on making it the best it can be. Do not let the anxiety and depression cloud your thoughts and make you do something irreversible.	[]	[{'start': 50, 'end': 57, 'span': 'Divorce', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
5ca0b46e8265280015164984	2184_ptsd	"15 years ago today, and it feels like it could genuinely happen again at any moment TW home invasion. TW gun violence.

&amp;#x200B;

Today it is 15 years since the event my family called The Incident. When I was 16, we went through a home-invasion in the middle of the night, in which I and my parents were shot. My parents and brother were also beaten. Though we all survived (by mere heartbeats, and with some permanent injuries), the level of violence and disregard for human life we experienced is grotesque.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in South Africa. Today, I board with my parents because they need the financial support, and because I frankly don't think it is safe to leave them alone in the old house. Yes, we still live in the same place. This time of the year is always the worst. July (midwinter here) gets freezing cold, just like that night I spent lying on the concrete in a pool of my own frigid blood, convinced that I was dying. We cannot go to bed until at least after midnight. We listen for the slightest sounds and stare out of the windows at shadows in the blackness.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are well into their 70s, and my father was disabled by the attack. They are struggling to live on a puny pension  (equivalent to about $70 a month) and my rent. I cannot get them to a safer place. I feel trapped here, playing the one younger stronger man in the household whose presence can hopefully deter an attack.

&amp;#x200B;

The usual July crime-wave is sweeping our area again. Yesterday a next-door-neighbour's house was broken into and ransacked. There is a small minority of people in this country who want White people dead. A month ago a young couple was shot to death in cold blood in a racist attack a couple of blocks away from me when their car ran out of fuel. They were executed, and the car was torched. These incidents constantly remind us of the hatred we tasted on that night. My nightmares of being shot are increasing in frequency, and last night I dreamt a man was slicing into my chest from all angles with a knife, in exactly the place where I was operated on after being shot.

5ca0b46e8265280015164984	2457_ptsd	"Please help me understand Hi everyone,

I’m having some difficulty understanding what’s going on in my head at the moment. I think I may have PTSD, at least, I appear to meet the DSM 5 criteria for it. The thing is that even the thought of PTSD had never popped into my head before a couple nights ago.

I was watching a cop drama where the main character had to go to a therapist for an evaluation. All of a sudden, BAM, that sounds a lot like me.

So here’s my story.

Last year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed. I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can’t and even if I could I probably wouldn’t share). Unfortunately, she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn’t save her. I had to relay all this whilst it was happening to my dad and my brother who were back in our home country. 

They were able to come out the next day luckily but I was alone all night.

Ever since then I’ve thought that I was just grieving normally for my mother. I do go to a therapist about it once a week. Whenever I talk to people about what happened they always say “it must have been so traumatic” but I myself have never used that word to describe it, not even in my own thoughts.

Now though, I can’t stop thinking that this may actually be affecting me. Actually, I knew how badly I was being affected but I just thought that it was part of the grieving process. I called a friend tonight and told her what I was thinking and she told me that she’s suspected it for months! She didn’t know how to tell me what she thought. I’m not mad or upset at her or anything but I am a bit shocked that someone could come to that conclusion so long before I even thought about it! 

I’m not self diagnosing but I would like to know for certain if it is PTSD or not. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and am planning to ask her.

Did any of you have this BAM realisation? How did you go about things afterwards?

Thank you for reading"	[]	[{'start': 767, 'end': 827, 'span': 'she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn’t save her.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

So, I've been dating a guy for 9 months. The first month was like a fairytale, he behaved good and I thought that he is a nice guy. But a month later he was in a car accident and it was his fault. He and his friend were almost dead. After a month in coma, he survived and there was nothing much changed in his behaviour towards me. He couldn't walk, use his hands either. I was next to him, but all of a sudden, he started abusing me, verbally. As a result of his abuse and the anxiety caused by that car accident I lost 11 kg (which is much because I am now 43kg, I was 40 when I was with him and with anorexia). In may, he raped me. He hit me, he used to lock me in his apartment after work and beat me. In june, he told me that I should leave my house. My parents were hitting me too... I didn't know what to do, so I left my house and this was my biggest mistake. I was with him 6 days. I lost kilos, he argued with me. On the sixth day, I told him that I wanted to go home. He started screaming at me, he broke my phone and threw me out the staircase in his house, almost breaking my leg. I started hitting him, and then he kicked me really hard in my arm, while he was aiming at my head....

I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes.  However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust.  My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again.  During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with.  But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child. 
   The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her.  He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away).  He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too.  He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since.  Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can’t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual.  Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time.  He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything.  He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time.  He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him.  He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.

My mom committed suicide. Do not pity her. She did this specifically to screw with me, that's how vindictive she was after years of physical and then more years after that of emotional and verbal abuse. I took it and did it proudly because it protected my little brother and I would do it again 50 times over. When my mom went absolutely insane a couple years before her death, I took care of everything, she was in jail, I visited her I would say every week except missing when I was too sick with migraines to drive or with bad roads. Anytime I missed I could expect a letter about how much she hated me. After she was divorced I stored all her things in the basement. I let her have unlimited access, she stole from me. She liked to torture me over suicide with multiple failed attempts and asking if I had her stepladder only to after me giving it to her have her text me about how she was about to kill herself, knowing I would be there because it was my duty. Her last day alive, she asked for access to her things, said that was fine but I was at work so it would probably have to wait for the weekend, she proceeded to tell me how awful a daughter I was, deserving of hell, how much she hated me etc. I told her (finally) to get over herself, she hung herself that night while I was searching for her. 


After, I thought I had to be the matriarch. I had to be strong for everyone, including my brother. So at 22 I planned my first funeral 7 days after my 22nd birthday and 7 days before Christmas. While everyone was shopping for gifts I was shopping for an appropriate turtle neck to cover signs of her death. I hated her more than I thought I could hate anyone and it hurt. It still hurts but 5 years later Im thankful I dont have an abuser anymore. Im working on being ok with being happy she is dead, that she doesnt deserve anything just for the title of ""mom"" and that I dont have to keep her crap or her ashes out of duty. I owe her nothing. 


You know what, tonight Im going to go get some of her favorite tequila, empty it any way I want, because I am not her and I dont hurt people when I drink and throw some ashes in there.

5ca0b46e8265280015164984	1744_ptsd	"Got triggered by the news and can't stop being depressed since (sexual assault) Not sure this is the right place to talk about this, I've never really used reddit before. Hopefully someone can help or at least understand what I'm struggling with.
I've been through major trauma 8 years ago, as I was walking home from school a man attacked me. He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.
He eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.
What followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. 
I've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.
My family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). 
I couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.

I kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost. I couldn't hold memories for a while and if you ask me about my last year in high school it's pretty confusing, I just remember parts and not in order. Depression, anxiety, fear or strangers, panic attacks and dissociation would come and go. 
Sometimes I'd just not feel anything, and sometimes I'd be angry at people for not understanding me.
I started doing therapy and slowly healing but still found it hard to deal with my emotions.

Eventually, I went to this Buddhist temple and started meditating, which really helped me and brought me back to reality. I stopped having panick attacks and was able to not think about it so much.
Going to college also helped, cause it felt like a new stage of life and I quit therapy because I felt no need to keep going.

Now, I've been doing pretty well in my life and most of the time don't even think about what happened. But the other day I read on the news about a 3 year old who was sexually abused, she was found with her diaper full of blood. Just typing this makes my eyes well up.
I can't stop thinking about that, about how fucked up the world is, and keep having flashbacks of what happened to me. It's making me depressed, affecting my relationships, my sex life and daily life.
I'm living far from my family, and I don't wanna tell them what's going on because they will just feel upset and powerless.
I try to forgive myself for not doing anything like running or kicking him, or just paying more attention because I didn't even see him approach me.. 
I guess now I'm just having a mix of emotions, I don't wanna live in the past but I'm not feeling connected to the present no matter how hard I try.

I feel very lonely because the people who love me can't really understand my feelings and I know they hurt too, but in a different way. I feel helpless.
I'm not even sure this is just PTSD or something else, if there is anything I can or should do...

Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity?  Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you."

really well. I get panic attacks sometimes at night still, but it’s no longer every single night, and I can get on the tube, stay at peoples houses etc and although I still get a little freaked out it’s definitely far more controllable than it was. Overall I’m happy with how well I’m doing. 

One thing I struggle with though is my anger. I have a follow up appointment with a therapist on March 3rd, which is 3 months after I was discharged as I no longer am any risk to myself (yay!) so I’ll talk to him about it, but I just wanted to post about it here.

Sometimes I just think about my situation, I had a good few male friends who decided to side with my friend who assaulted me, which is a pattern of how all of them have treated women. I didn’t realise how they treated the females in their lives until I put all of these events together and realised. They aren’t nice people, and sometimes that just makes me so angry because they’re all just going to live their lives genuinely convinced that turning against a victim of sexual assault and covering it up was something that was justified because of their own personal issues. It makes me angry to the point of tears and I just want to be able to keep it under control, but im not sure how.

I’ve been told this anger is normal, but I haven’t ever had to deal with it because before this i was super non confrontational and calm so it’d be nice to hear some tips, if anyone has any."	[]	[{'start': 804, 'end': 830, 'span': 'my friend who assaulted me', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I didn't consent but at the time I felt like since he was my boyfriend it was okay. I've come to realize that it wasn't okay and I was violated. 
I have been having horrible nightmares of the incident, of him committing the act in another way, of him being in my life, of everyone dismissing that he was abusive because they liked him (which happened irl.) When I see someone with a patchy beard like him, curly hair like him or a car like him, my heart stops. I cry all the time when I even think of a physical relationship.

It was recommended that I do EDMR but I read that EDMR has you recall the events and I’m worried that if I purposely recall the events that I’ll kill myself. Everyone tells me how much EDMR helped lessen the severity of their PTSD but it doesn’t work immediately, right? So after that first session when I’ve just recalled everything I’d be extremely at risk, right? But on the other hand if I keep avoiding this treatment then the PTSD will never stop.

I don’t have any friends or family nearby who can babysit me. I’m in the US so I don’t get time off work and I can’t afford hospitalization. I’m worried that if I bring up this concern that I’ll be involuntarily committed. 

Not to mention that part of my PTSD comes with a complete distrust of hospitals, doctors, nurses, all of it. I can only trust hard data from actual test results which has already led to a statistically unwarranted biopsy that I needed to get or else I’d lose my mind but who knew you had to be awake for biopsies?! They messed up the procedure and I had to hear the whole conversation that basically went “oops we need to get another doctor in here to fix this” and I could feel all the blood running down my ribs and it’s like, what the actual fuck doctors truly are idiots. If I didn’t have so much experience cutting I’m sure the incision thing would have f’d me up too. The lump was benign.

The PTSD isn’t too bad if I just avoid everything but mornings are rough from nightmares and trying to reconcile my reality again.

60f68b570ae2316894fb0a51	2434_ptsd	"(TW) A bad sexual experience when I was 18 still affects me, I’m not sure if I was traumatized Okay, I’m going to preface this by saying that I did have a moderately traumatic childhood, I want to contextualize things in hopes to give better insight. 
I grew up in a turbulent and dysfunctional environment, I was also tormented by my peers growing up and endured profound alienation and loneliness. My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I’ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they’d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn’t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn’t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. 

When I was 18 (I’m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.

On my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me. We met up and drove around, hung out at his place and divulged in deep conversations for hours on end. 

After a couple of times he became very flirtatious and made a pass at me. 
I was pretty sexually inexperienced and he knew that, in hindsight I feel as though  he fetishized my innocence (he casually) brought it up countless times. When we first started hooking  up , it was pretty vanilla and ..normal I guess.


Overtime he began to become really aggressive and rough , he was kind of coercive and disregarded some of my boundaries. He would choke me so hard to where I would run out of air and the next day my neck would be riddled with bruises (I was okay with choking but not that extreme). I have a visceral memory of how dark and sinister his eyes looked while he would do this. 

On one occasion he did something  I did NOT consent too and it really upset me, I consented you’re sex but not what he did in the midst of it(I don’t feel comfortable being less vague ) it wasn’t I’ve isolated thing, but during that instance I remember spacing out until it was over with..was paralyzed and couldn’t think. He took me home and gave the impression he was oblivious and things were fine ,  I didn’t tell him what I was feeling. I felt stupid because I am partially responsible for putting myself in a compromising position and allowing myself to be taken  advantage of, I also had such little value in myself that I didn’t want him to stop seeing me. After a while he ghosted me, and I was devastated. I was angry and felt used and beat myself up over it for a while. 

He also dated a string of girls around my age, I didn’t find that off until it was over though. 

I didn’t tell anyone about this, I didn’t want my parents to find out or to be judged but I feel like this was a tipping point into my descent of substance abuse and depression. 
There were so many other things that contributed 
To my depression manifesting and festering over time and this wasn’t the worst thing that happened to me per-say but it was the straw that broke the camels back. 

I haven’t had sex in 2 years  I don’t date and I wish that I could go back In time and stop everything from happening. I wish I could scrub it from my mind entirely but I can’t and I still have dreams about the whole ordeal. 


Any advice on how to open up about this to a therapist, I’ve always felt too embarrassed to. I’m afraid I’ll never be able to have or want s relationship and It sucks."

60f68b570ae2316894fb0a51	2036_ptsd	"Could I have PTSD? Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.

So after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.

As I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.


So here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:

Some years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.

All this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.

Then after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.

Some time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.

Before all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.

Now after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. 

So my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?

I never told my parents (that I remember, it happened when I was 5-6 and my parents have always treated me like a dramatic liar so maybe I did tell them and forgot)

Last year (I was 25 or 26) my mother told me that when I was a child I used to be happy and curious and full of life, and that it suddenly changed ""for no reason"". I have no memories of ever having been anything other than a sad, sometimes angry child. She can be quite abusive emotionally so I'm not really sure what she wanted me to take away from that, it felt a little accusatory like she believes 5 year-old-me decided to become bitter just to flex on her.

It reminded me of when I was 13 and I went to a doctor for my insomnia. After talking with her and testing a few things she wanted to talk to my parents so they came with me to the next appointment. he told them that there seemed to be no physical problem but from our conversation she could tell that I probably needed therapy. My father basically told her that I was a dramatic idiot who made things up for attention and we left.

Now the trauma is resurfacing, new memories are coming and I can barely function. Not to mention the added trauma of having grown up without effective coping mechanisms and the abusive relationship I got into and stayed into because I didn't know I was a human being who deserved to be treated as such. I'm so angry and I can't stop thinking about where I would be now if they had allowed me to get help 14 years ago, or better yet 22 years ago when they noticed something had drastically changed.

so i’ve opened up to my best friend about a lot over the years, and she always seemed pretty understanding of my trauma and everything. but in the past few months it really seems like she’s either forgotten that i went through severe trauma or just thinks it’s not that big a deal and i don’t really have ptsd. i first noticed it when we ran into my abuser and she seemed to warn me at first, but then told me to “stop being such a little bitch” when i started having a panic attack and wanted to leave the store. this just really got to me because i know she has been in almost the exact same situation and i did whatever i could to help her and get her out of there, but when it’s me i need to get over it so she can keep shopping for candy. something like this happened again when she tried to pressure me into going to a concert of someone who’s music severely triggers me and i straight out told her “i can’t do that it would severely trigger my ptsd”, but then she spent 10 minutes afterward trying to convince me to go because it’s her favorite singer and she doesn’t want to go alone. i just feel like she’s being completely selfish and expecting me to compromise my mental health so that she can have fun. i’m at the point where i just want to cut her off but i feel like i can’t do that without expressing my feelings at least once so here we are i guess. idk if i’ll tell her any of this because i’m really not looking to have a fight or talk shit out, at this point it’s pretty obvious to me that she doesn’t really respect me and repeatedly ignores one of my biggest struggles in life. i just can’t have a friend who i’m scared to hang out with because i think they’ll try and force me to stay in triggering situations and i definitely can’t have a friend who tells me to get over it after telling them everything i’ve been through."

She had two children, a daughter my age and a son who was in middle/high school. The daughter was my best friend at the time and the son was mentally challenged. He would lure me into his room by playing the ""Barbie Girl"" song by Aqua, I loved Barbies. The mother would always make him take me to the bathroom, even though I knew where it was. He would touch me and force me to touch him. I still remember how cramped the space was and how he would stand in the stall with me while I went to the bathroom. I still remember how hot his penis always was. The babysitting stopped when I came home one day and told my mom that he had shoved his tongue in my mouth/down my throat. But neither of my parents knew the extent of the abuse until I was in middle school, half a state away.

Recently, I've come to the age where I should be getting a regular physical. The thought of opening my legs to anyone, let alone my female doctor, horrifies me to an extent I've never been frightened before. Even before she could explain anything, I was in tears and shaking uncontrollably. The speculum looks like a weapon to me. Even the thought of being in a hospital gown scares me. She says that I don't need to have one, but I want to have children and getting a physical is the first step to understanding my full health spectrum. I'm in therapy because I couldn't go through with the physical, and I still haven't been able to do it one year later. She won't put me out for it and only offers me ibuprofen and xanax.

Last night, even just thinking about the physical had me shaking and in tears. I curled up in a ball and closed my legs as tight as I could. Even now, typing this, I have my legs crossed tight. I think the son of my babysitter must have done more to me than just touching. I don't know how to cope with this. I'm still a virgin and have never had a real boyfriend. The last guy that tried to have sex with me was very insistent and I wasn't ready. He was disappointed and stopped talking to me when I pushed him away and accused him of only wanting me for sex. I want to have kids and I want to have sex, but I want to have them with someone I trust and love and who loves and trusts me back. I also have a horrible gag reflex and fear of blowjobs. I know that talking to my therapist is the best way to work through all of this but I have other issues that have taken precedence at the moment.

My trauma comes from someone close to me attempting suicide, blaming it on me, and then continously blaming his suicidal feelings on me and saying he was thinking of killing himself and only telling me that and guilt tripping me when I tried to call him out on it.

My symptoms aren't severe, however, I've found myself avoiding the places where the catalyst for all of this happened, and I've had strange instances where I've had nightmares involving the catalyst playing out wordlessly, then turning into a fantasy situation of me running away. I can talk about it, but I will only talk about it if I'm the one who is in charge of the conversation.

But the worst that's happened is when I walked past that spot, as I need to to get home, I don't remember what happened except for a few splashes, which I remember as the guy who traumatised me. When I looked in car windows for my reflection, or thought, all I could hear were the words he said and all I could see was his reflection, and I could only picture myself as him.

My therapist said that it happens to a lot of people and that it's nothing to get caught up in, but should I push the possibility of maybe being a bit more traumatised than I've let on? I've only told her about the catalyst, and not everything about the catalyst."

I was in a horrible car crash, probably the worst you could get in and walk away from just to give some description. 

It was on the 19th of November. My 14 year old sister had emergency surgery on her intestine. My dad got banged and bruised badly and still feels it a bit. I felt only a little sore, but I can’t get it out of my head. It’s like an ongoing battle. At first, I thought of the crash itself, then I thought about other crashes, then I thought about scenarios not even related to cars (examples would be: what if I randomly lost the ability to use my legs and fell and busted my teeth out? Or What if the entire world collapses?). I get very nervous when others drive, I can’t help but think of how close we are to the other cars and how fast we are coming up to a red light. I end up pinching myself or doing this weird slurping noise with my mouth. 

The images have gotten better, though if anxious they could get bad.

I had managed to drive and pass my drivers test with an 84. Haven’t driven on the road since I took the test, only an empty parking lot and I felt fine.

Yesterday, my dad surprised me with a 2019 civic (he wanted to get something with high safety ratings)  and today he wants me to drive 5 minutes up the road to my job with him in the car. I’m trying to think like “I pay the insurance, it’s a smaller car than my dad’s, I like the way it drives, very good safety ratings, I drove from Kilgore through Dallas for hours so I can do this” basically to hype myself up. My dad does not want to enable my behavior because he knows it can get worse with time.

Anyways, I’m just trying to get some advice. Please help, I’m really tired of being this anxious all the time.

5f2acd4b53b8533a53c7bc89	2494_ptsd	"Unresolved Childhood PTSD from a near-death experience Hi there,

So this might be a bit of lengthy ramble, but bear with me. As a kid I used to love horse riding, so so much. I went to a prestigious equestrian school twice a week and did everything from hacking, to showjumping, to novice dressage. I got decent enough that I was really comfortable in the saddle. I loved going cantering because of the thrill, and I had confidence dealing with horses that spooked or acted difficult.

However, one day when I was twelve I fell from horse during a showjumping event. It was a horse hadn't ridden much and wasn't used to its mannerisms. I later discovered I'd broken my coccyx (tailbone) and was in pain for weeks afterwards but because I immediately got back on the horse after the fall and continued to ride for bit, I wasn't too shaken up about it.

About a month later, my parents were looking into buying a horse for me and we thought we'd finally found a good beginner horse. The owners seemed to think this horse was a good match, however, upon riding the horse I discovered that it was extremely flighty. It didn't listen to me at all and would just bolt off in random directions at a full gallop no matter how hard I tried to pull it back. At this point, I started to panic. I didn't like feeling like I wasn't in control of the animal. Eventually it threw me off, hard. I was okay, but determined to see if I could control this horse, I got on again. This was a mistake. The second time it threw me off at a full gallop (around 60km/h) and I landed on my head. I had a bad concussion and couldn't see properly. I also had severe neckpain similar to a whiplash-type injury. I was also very very traumatised by what had happened. I felt paralysed by fear.

After recovering from my physical injuries, I attempted to resume riding lessons but this failed. I couldn't be atop a horse for more than five minutes without breaking down in tears. Every moment I spent on horseback was pure terror, even with sound horses I'd known for years. Nothing seemed to help. My instructor began to get very frustrated with me, and this made me hate myself even more. Eventually my mum sent me to therapy where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Though the therapy was useful and I found myself unwilling to get on a horse again. My experienced had permanently turned me off horses.

So now I'm in my twenties, and considering revisiting the possibility of riding in a controlled environment with very sound horses. Although I don't think I still have PTSD (in that I no longer have nightmares or flashbacks) I am still suffering from a kind of trauma that I wish to heal. On the one hand I'm terrified of getting on a horse again, on the other hand I don't think there's any other way to put this behind me. What should I do?

TL;DR: Had PTSD from falling off a horse and now almost a decade later I'm considering riding again."	[]	"[{'start': 526, 'end': 728, 'span': ""I fell from horse during a showjumping event.

5f2acd4b53b8533a53c7bc89	2571_ptsd	"A lot of things I don't understand that haunt me every single day... when I was 19 I fell in love with a guy who I had no idea was on meth and he got me started on it. I was on paxil at the same time. I instantly became addicted and a friend who hung out with us then says she remembers I was constantly ill and sleeping and that the guy was giving me pills all the time, she said he told me they'd help me feel better but now I think it may have been something to keep me doped up so he could bring people into the house, I have a memory of him bringing a friend and the friend was smoking heroin and I was too out of it to care at the time. I lost the apartment I was living in due to not paying rent and I ended up with a friend of his that lived in the complex and was also a tweaker and much older than me. This is where it got very bad, he was very sadistic and verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. He told me he was intentionally trying to make me go crazy, and he would just stand there and smile and taunt me when he got me to the point of crying. He talked about ways to kill me, and weird things like splitting my mind and making me reborn and being one of the ""elite"" by being tortured. Just really insane and confusing and he kept me in a constant state of anxiety to the point where I would have panic attacks when he wasn't home, especially after I found him hiding in the pantry when I thought he had left... he was physically abusive as well but it went deeper than the ""normal"" abuse because he would have a totally different voice, different face everything when he would talk about that weird stuff it literally scared me to my core because it was like being talked to by a demon... and he made me feel so dehumanized and worthless, he told me there were all these things wrong with me and I developed a fear of going outside which lead to me being trapped in the apartment with him for 7 months. I believe he drugged me as well as revenge for having him put in jail but that is a whole other long and horrible story. All of this happened in a short period of time. 

My memory is really messed up when it comes to all of that. I don't know exactly when it began, and there are huge chunks of time missing. I actually had a point where I just ""woke up"" but I was sitting in my bed, I didn't remember ANYTHING for several minutes and even as things came back to me, I had this horrible weird feeling like my name and my room were not mine. I didn't know what I was doing before that and my bed and the furniture were moved and I still don't remember moving anything. I have never understood that but when this happened I returned to the abusive guy (I was all alone, as an addict he was the ONLY person who still talked to me and at that point I was convinced that I was crazy and none of the things he did happened) and he acted all emotional and told me some weird stuff about how it finally happened and that ""Caeley #1"" has died and I was now ""Caeley #2"". It made me feel more alone and terrified and I now wonder about the possibility of having DID (I had traumatic things happen as a child) or if it's part of PTSD and depersonalization/derealization disorder I've been diagnosed with. 

Another thing I wonder about is why I am so emotionally detached from my memories. I remember it like it happened to someone else and I was watching, not like it happened to me. It makes me wonder if I even have PTSD at all. I only hear about people with PTSD being fearful and crying and everything but I am not like that, yet it still affects me and my life in other ways. Until recently (I think having a baby has changed it) I was unable to cry. I talk about it constantly, I think about it constantly, but it's the same memories over and over and I feel nothing when I think about them, just disturbed by the lack of feeling. I feel like not feeling anything makes it even harder to move past it... it's like I'm stuck. Like I blocked out the emotions then when they got too horrible to deal with and then I just stayed like that. I cry about other things, I feel love and everything but I'm totally detached from the memories. I factually know how I felt then. I know I was in absolute despair and so much pain but like someone else TOLD me how they felt. 

When I talk about this stuff, I do not feel any anxiety at all, but my back tightens up and I begin shaking and getting cold, every time. When I'm talking about it out loud, if I go on too long the tightness in my back spreads through my body and makes it hard for me to breathe and I have to stop talking. Once I stop talking about it, it goes away. It has made it difficult for me to explain everything to a therapist. It's very weird and I'm serious when I say I do not feel the anxiety whatsoever when I talk about it... it's just my body reacting that way. When I was typing what happened, I got those physical symptoms and when I started typing this, it faded away. Is it still PTSD if I am emotionally detached from the memories? Is there a type of therapist or someone that can help me connect to those memories and move past it? I was seeing a counselor in my home town but I got married and moved, and she wasn't helping any way because she didn't understand what I meant when I told her about the detachment. I just really need peace, and to move on. I feel like I'm just trapped in these memories until I feel like they were real... as weird as I know that sounds. I hope someone out there understands.  This drives my husband crazy and he doesn't know what to do :("	[]	[{'start': 427, 'end': 521, 'span': 'I think it may have been something to keep me doped up so he could bring people into the house', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.

This is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):

A couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.

Then, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to ""listen to her point of view because she had listened to me."" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our ""conversation."" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.

At some point in this ""conversation"" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say ""No"" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said ""nice talking to you guys."" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.

In the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way ""there"".  

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole ""me"" in ways I have never experienced before. In any case, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support anyone might be able to offer."

Some of them have turned into physical fights,well most of them...and I always see all of it!and I have seen my mom get pushed and her finger get snapped/broken by her bf.she obviously has to fight back for self defence so she does..but he try’s to convince her to give him another chance and that he will change.he says that every single time and yet he still haven’t changed.I even told my mom that...they suffer from alcohol education and my mom thinks that’s the only way she can fall asleep.and some times she gets black out drunk and gets mad at me easy and when I say something that makes her upset... she takes it out on me and if not me her bf mostly her bf tho.. but some fight have scared me half to death bc I thought it was gonna end up in death. I thought one of them was gonna get killed.And if they r fighting downstairs I can hear them hitting each other if it’s physical or if they r going at each other or push each other and it makes a loud noise, like a bang on the ground or something.
But the things I’m experiencing (the after effects) they don’t know about...
Let me explain.
So I have bad anxiety(I haven’t rly been diagnosed with it but my mom know I have it and it’s rly bad to the point where I have anxiety attacks) but I always get triggered when I hear a big stomp upstairs, I always think it’s them fighting again and I get rly scared, but when I go up it’s just my siblings playing around,and I have to try and clap down.
(Loud bangs,slap sounds ,yells,other noises)scare me anxiety kicks in right away. Also sometimes I wake up and I think they are fighting again but I go down and they are sleeping and it’s just the tv,but it sounded like they are fighting.so I Can’t rly go back to sleep easy. Or if they are talking loud r sometimes just talking Normally and I’m upstairs in my room it’s sound like they are arguing and my anxiety get triggered and I feel like I want to cry,even when my mom is talking on the phone she kinda talks loud a lot bc I think she is losing hearing a little,so she talks a little louder than needed and it triggers me bc I keep thinking I hear them arguing but it’s just them talking normally.
I have watched this YouTube video and there where parents arguing in it and I immediately started crying bc it gave me some kinda flash back ig and it sounded exactly like there fighting. Sometimes I can’t sleep especially when they argue. And when I’m class the topic of abuse or any kind of toxic family topic come up I have to leave the class and clam down. It also doesn’t help that my neighbour has bad anxiety and screams at night sometimes and I wake up rly scared bc I think my they are fighting. I don’t know exactly what to call it bc I don’t want to diagnose my self but I think it could be ptsd and yes it trauma I have gone through other things in my life as in seeing someone get stabbed but I don’t worry about those as much because I can’t remember them as much as what I am going threw rn... if u read this that is my story and thanks for taking the time to see what’s happening this is my first time posting on here pls don’t judge me &lt;3"	[]	[{'start': 972, 'end': 1043, 'span': 'have seen my mom get pushed and her finger get snapped/broken by her bf', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I have been diagnosed with anxiety, DID, and depression. 
I have been avoiding water for years. I grew up swimming regularly, but it's been six years since I did, and ten years since I stopped regularly going. 

I've had episodes for a while now, on and off. Bad nightmares. Visceral nightmares. I'd go into detail but I'm trying not to trigger anyone.

Then I started getting flashbacks. My sister used to attack me. She used to choke me, drown me, and physically attack me. My mother assaulted me a few times when I was very little, and gave me a really bad scare when I was a young teen. My father would go on rampages that I was always terrified would escalate to violence but rarely did. 

Two weeks ago, I had... an episode. Something I haven't had in that severity since 2008. My fiancee made a comment like my father would have made, before he would force an intense cleaning episode where he screamed at me for an hour while I cleaned as fast as possible while crying. I don't fully remember all of what happened, but I threw money at her, told her I was a worthless piece of shit, did all of the chores I could manage (made myself sick while doing so) and then climbed under the bed to cry. 

It was... intense. She and I made a plan for what to do if it were to happen again, but it's scary to me that it happened, so I finally bit the bullet and am getting a consultation with a therapist that specializes in CBT and PTSD. I wanted to share that with someone, since I rarely let myself dwell on this, and it's a big step."	[]	[{'start': 568, 'end': 653, 'span': 'My sister used to attack me.

5f2acd4b53b8533a53c7bc89	1401_ptsd	"I think I have an episode of PTSD. Help is appreciated. Hello.
I live in a very unsafe country. I grew accustomed somehow to the hazardous risk of my daily life (due to rampant deliquency) and fortunately, due to my residence in an upscale neighborhood, I haven't been really that exposed to the real face of danger.
Nonetheless, tonight, while scrolling down the timeline on Twitter, I came across this gory video of a young man (way too young, a teenager) been brutally beheaded after what looks like a horribly agonizing execution.
It seems it was the by-product of mafia wars but it occured in my home country, fortunately, far away from the capitol city.
However, the video shocked me so much that I can't really think of other things now. I'm really paranoid now that someone could break into my house and subject me to such a dreadful death. I'm paranoid about the domestic employee (from a poor side of the city) to gang up with others to assault on me in order to steal from me or something like that. It got to the point that I felt like throwing up at least a good half an hour after watching the video.

I have never considered myself sensitive to this kind of material. Actually I had watched several of them in the past but this one really hit home. 

I believe the paranoid thoughts (which I never had) and feeling unsafe for my dog and myself (due to a good part of the population being deprived of proper food and healthcare) are an episode of PTSD.

I want to thank all of the police officers, especially those fighting organized-crime for the daunting risk they take on our behalf. I believe that for the first time ever I understand how they expose their relatives and families and I really want to express my gratitude.

THank you very much for reading this and any help is appreciated."	[]	[{'start': 406, 'end': 482, 'span': 'gory video of a young man (way too young, a teenager) been brutally beheaded', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

In virtual reality exposure therapy, the person is immersed in a computer-created virtual environment. While initially developed for advanced game play, it was quickly realized that the technology could also be used therapeutically.  The first study with ten veterans demonstrated that this therapy was effective in symptom improvement in all participants. This success was considered so significant that after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York’s World Trade Center, burn victims suffering from PTSD were treated using virtual reality exposure techniques. The outcomes for this treatment situation was also extremely successful. 

To date, virtual reality exposure therapy for PTSD has primarily been used with Vietnam War veterans so the virtual setting includes such imagery as helicopters and jungles. Research has shown that this type of therapy helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in these veterans. A few subsequent studies conducted with small numbers of Iraq and Afghanistan War vets found that virtual reality based therapy was also helpful in reducing symptoms in these former soldiers. 

[This article](https://medium.com/swlh/the-only-way-out-is-through-using-virtual-reality-for-ptsd-in-veterans-a0a3a0b1b3db?source=friends_link&amp;sk=67afc5dbc04e6a71afec35e744d68eb1) discussed an amazing personal experience working on an inpatient PTSD unit at the VA Hospital in New Orleans.

I repressed most of my childhood and I like it that way, but I didn't realize I was missing adult years. Anyone else lose large amounts of time as an adult? I'm not sure how to explain this. I'll start by saying I moved out right at 18, but ages 19-21 have always been hard to remember. I'm 37. Before now, I could tell an occasional story about those years but I couldn't ever get a timeline to make sense for me and never wanted to delve too deep into it. Mostly I think my memory loss is a protective measure and I appreciate and enjoy it. 

All of a sudden, out if the blue, it hit me like a ton of bricks and the full extent of my repression was glaringly apparent. It was to the point where up until recently, the information about where I thought lived during part of that time would have even been wrong. Now I'm being flooded with memories of a time I now know I didn't want to remember. I don't want them. 

It also makes me question my reality. For example: A couple years ago something happened at a bar where I was sexually assaulted. I always thought I was roofied because that time is just gone. I don't know what happened, just that I was missing for a while after going outside, and I got out of someone's grip pulling my arm really hard in the alley behind the bar. I was covered in bruises and could barely walk for days afterwards. Talking it over with some friends, I'm not sure I'm missing enough time to have been drugged, and no idea what happened in that alley.

i still deal with PTSD like symptoms such as strong twitching when thinking about my past or very sad subjects. im especially sensitive to things like that. if im at work im distant from others and if left with time to wander in my thoughts, i will think about dark stuff and flinch very noticeably - and others might ask why i do that. it's embarrassing but at other times i feel completely okay, even happy, can function for days no problem. i even have the habit a bit contradictory to the sad thought flinch - just thinking of little jokes and i'll laugh out loud - and of course that's embarrassing to as i seem like a crazy person to my co-workers. i guess i have a strong pendulum of emotion and react strongly to it. other times its long bouts of apathy. 


so im thinking about getting therapy / help again. but even looking around on websites and thinking about getting that help upsets me. i flinch pretty hard but not even on certain hard memories, just vague memories of the multiple occasions when i had a bad time in my past. i think PTSD, if i really do have it, probably blurred my memory on certain bad things. i also can't find any good info on this stuff. i don't know if i should get therapy or not either - money is a problem for me and therapy brings out the worst emotions. i don't want to feel those bad emotions, its very painful.

On Jan. 30, 2018 I became a survivor of murder-suicide.

Facts were written in the media, case files, autopsy reports and death certificates. They were illustrated with crime scene photos and national news headlines.

Breadcrumbs of truth built the narrative for me, never telling the full story.

There are 11 murder-suicides each week in the United States, often in military and veteran communities. Why aren’t we talking about this publicly beyond sensationalized headlines that don’t help solve the problem?

The lack of support, information, and humanization led me to believe nobody *should* be talking about it. I felt voiceless and carried significant guilt and shame because of the stigmatized circumstances.

I’m taking back the narrative. As a survivor of murder-suicide, I am more than a murderer’s daughter.

My writing will add to the national conversation on mental health and veteran post-traumatic stress disorder. I hope my story will educate the public and help survivors of this type of tragedy to know they are not alone; the shame is not theirs to carry as they navigate their complex journey.

If you are a survivor of murder-suicide, or know somebody who is looking for support, please consider following my blog here: [www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com](https://www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com). I am connecting with researchers and fellow survivors to reduce the stigma on this awful experience, and help other survivors.

We got into some heated banter and I took more meds (accidentally 1 over the daily max..I'm okay I think?) And a manager came out of course. I explained all of this, and manager did not previously know of my condition or any others. He seemed understanding, but I've seen fake understanding too much so I don't know. I was already waiting to go home so I clocked out.

I smacked my head against my car window a bit, it's been quite some time since I've self harmed like that. I screamed for unknown minutes in my car before peeling out in a panic. I'm pretty sure people saw me speed off, but I don't think anyone saw me hit my head. I've no idea how loud I screamed, or if anyone was out to hear at the time.

The only good thing about that night was person B, a good friend and confidant, messaged me to let me know people said A deserved it and I won't get in trouble.

I'm afraid to go back. I'm afraid to be near *anyone* there, for anyone to mention it, for anyone to hate me, let alone A. I'm afraid to lose another job to panic despite B saying it'll be fine. I'm afraid of more head bruises every time I have a severe panic attack, or something worse of it over time.

The good news is I'm already socially awkward and do not smile much, so if everything else remains the same, nobody will have to know how the aftermath feels."

It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. I don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I don't know if he's evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest. A good therapist can support you in these goals.

616c380ec7e2787b3631ac40	1524_ptsd	"PTSD from forced sex work A bit of background here - I (29 F) was heavily involved in the drug scene back in my early twenties. Prior to that, in high school, I was very promiscuous (possibly as a result of taking medication meant for depression while actually being bipolar, perhaps sending me into a mania).

In my drug phase, there were lots of times I’d have sex for drugs. Sometimes I wouldn’t expect it - thinking that I could just pay the guy for my drugs like a normal transaction, but they ended up not wanting the money and I’d give in. 

the climax of it all happened when I was desperately looking for a fix and this guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help. I got in the car (I know, stupid as hell) and he ended up getting me a handful of pills. I didn’t know what they were, but I downed all of them. I passed out and then when I woke up, we were hundreds of miles away from where we originally met and he proceeds to explain to me that I’m “going to be working for him now”. He was a pimp. 

I spent the next few weeks in that situation - he took my cell phone, kept me drugged up, woke me up at 8am everyday to start working until the late hours of night. He’d yell at me if I had any bruises from someone being too rough with me. 

I had tried to kill my self then, but it didn’t work and woke up to him screaming at me about it.

The only way I was able to contact anyone was when I had developed an infection in my arm from IV drug use and he finally (after days of this) agreed to take me to the ER. I called my family from there and thankfully he agreed to just drop me off at the airport where they would pick me up.

I’ve talked about this many times in counseling, but it’s always been like I was talking about the weather. No emotion behind it, just nonchalantly telling the story.  

It wasn’t until very recently that I thought about the whole situation and realized that I had been kidnapped. That yes, I was looking for drugs and that was bad, but I was kidnapped and taken captive and used.

Since this realization, I’ve been having flashbacks, especially during sex. And having sex is a whole different can of worms for me - lots of times, my body doesn’t “feel” anything. It’s like I’m still in prostitution mode, where I act like I’m enjoying it but really can’t wait for it to be over. The only way I can get off is by imagining my partner having sex with other people - it’s like I can’t allow myself and my own body to experience pleasure. Imagining things like that make me feel like a creep and it takes
something that’s supposed to be intimate and skews it into this fucked up thing.


Last night, I felt it came to a head. I was having sex with my boyfriend and just began having flashbacks of my time as a prostitute - seeing images of guys putting money on the table, disassociating from my body and I then felt this sensation of such anger that I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted to bit my boyfriend across the face, scratch him, grab his face hard. I feel so terrible about it. I started crying and then of course that ruined the moment and the poor guy had no idea what was going through my head.

He knows some of what I’ve been through, but there’s so much he doesn’t know and doesn’t want to know. I don’t blame him. 


I want to enjoy sex again. I’m seeing a therapist and am on medication for bipolar, but this shit just haunts me. I can’t tell if I actually enjoy sex or just default to prostitute mode where i make all the sounds and motions of enjoying something, like I’m acting and playing the part. 

Does anyone else have similar stories that they can offer advice about? I’m in such a low spot. I’ve been contemplating suicide for feeling like such a burden.

tw: SA, controlling relationship, stalking, drugged

\------

\------

\------

PLEASE be warned i explain the source of my trauma here and i dont want anyone to be triggered.

&amp;#x200B;

i've recently been diagnosed with what my psychiatrist calls ""late-onset PTSD"", which i did not know was a thing that could happen. it stems from a pattern of episodes from when i was younger where my first serious boyfriend repeatedly drugged and raped me without my knowledge (until one day i wasn't ""out"" when he did it and tried to break it off with him soon thereafter). he then stalked and harassed me for about a year and a half after i broke it off with him. obviously the experience was upsetting and awful but i seemed to be okay for a few years after it happened. or at least i thought i was? 

&amp;#x200B;

but within the last several years i've had several people tell me that i seem like i've changed - i get extremely uncomfortable in big crowds (like at a concert) and i never used to feel that way, i obsessively check to make sure my door is locked, i feel the need to keep a weapon in my room even though i've never felt that way before, and i constantly fear that someone will break into my house (something that he would try to do when he was stalking me). there are other things but those are the big ones. i will be honest, i found out a few years ago that he moved out of state and i frequently check to make sure he is still far away from me, and i feel a lot of shame about that. i thought i was just having really, really bad anxiety related to the high pressure from school and work, and i've even been told that these periods of hypervigilance might be due to misdiagnosed bipolar II, but my doctor believes i have PTSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

i am in the medical field and my father has PTSD - i thought i understood this condition very well. but i guess i don't. so i am here to ask if anyone else has had a similar experience - a ""late-onset"" of PTSD - and how you dealt with it after years of thinking you had everything under control. i feel very lost, angry, confused, scared. it is hard for me to be intimate with other people in so many ways and i feel like i am losing my friends because of what i am going through. i am trying to find a therapist but they are all very expensive even with insurance, and i am on medication management (third round of combo antipsychotics and antidepressants, the last two didnt work, meds kind of help but not really). i don't know what to do anymore, so please, if you had a similar experience... can you share how you dealt with it? this is so exhausting."

hi, im 14 y/o and ive just realised my sister's boyfriend has been grooming me. ive talked to some people on r/SuicideWatch and r/survivorsofabuse and they were all very kind and helpful and i appreciate the time they took to warn me, a lot.

long story short, I met my sister's boyfriend when i was about 10-11. hes probably 30 right now and my sister is turning 30 soon. he has been touching me inappropriately for a long time now and it was until recently that i figured out this was wrong. he seemed like such a cool and nice guy to whom i could talk about videogames and tv shows with.

will this leave a permanent mark on me? i don't want to develop ptsd, i want to live a normal life. a few years ago when i started researching more about mental health and i came across ptsd it seemed like such a serious thing to me, which i guess it is, but i never thought id get to the point of thinking im at risk. i understand you guys can't diagnose me and im ok with that. i just want to compare my experiences to someone who has gone through the same things.

somehow this is all my fault. i did this to myself. i think it was like 2 years ago when i told him the tv in my living room had some porn channels in it. he didn't believe me so he started searching for them until he found one. we ended up watching porn together, another time i woke up before him and saw him stroking himself (he probably thought i was asleep), today he asked me if id wear lingerie after touching me on my thighs, waist and resting his head on my shoulder while playing a sexual hentai videogame. i can't help but think im the cause of this. im a teen, sexual thoughts do cross my mind but for some reason i think im the one who kickstarted the situation im in for even daring to think about anything sexual. ive never been so ashamed of myself.

can i live a normal life after this? i feel like im overreacting to this even though ive been told my reaction is perfectly normal. i wish i could forget all of this. i don't even feel like a normal person anymore, everything feels like a bad dream that im going to wake up from any minute now, the world doesn't even look real."

I’ve had my fair share of rough relationships, sure, who hasn’t? But the last few years has been beyond bad. Like ending a 10 year relationship, losing a job I loved bc of my mental health, trying to move on with someone else and dealing with mental torture that led to a suicide attempt bad. I feel so stupid and pathetic even typing this. I mean people have been through so much worse. Yeah I was sexually abused as a child but that was forever ago and I was never physically abused in my relationships. But on top of depression, anxiety, and avoidant personality disorder, I’ve also just been diagnosed with PTSD stemming from the last couple years. Maybe this is considered complex-PTSD and should be posted there instead? Sorry. 

It felt dumb to me hearing that. I know it’s possible. I guess I’m just in denial. But then I think about it. We didn’t even have a long relationship. 9 months. That’s nothing. But the last 3 months he inflicted more damage than I’d known in 10 years. I haven’t seen or spoken to him since my suicide attempt in September 2018. I’ve sought help. I’m on meds again and in therapy. I’m better than I used to be. Then today I got a message from his gf. There’s a whole backstory to her but it’s honestly just too complicated to explain right now.

Like I was about to pass out. (Panic attack, I know) I could see him again perfectly. In my face screaming. I could hear him. Feel his skin. Smell him. Everything. I was watching a movie with my kids (they’re 13 and 11) so I calmly got up and went outside and just completely broke down.

We were walking on a large piece of machinery when the grating broke and he fell from in front of me 40' to the ground. I ran for help and was first on scene. 

I took 2 months off after that and tried to cope on my own for a month which failed miserably but after that I started therapy which started helping. I ran out of money about 2 months in as work safe hadn't started sending me cheques yet so I tried to go back to work. I managed to work a couple of days a week for a few weeks until one day I was asked to do a job at heights. I took one look down the ladder I was supposed to go down and instantly had a panic attack. I went home that day and haven't been back to work since

I've spent the last year working with an occupational therapist to do exposure therapy for the crippling fear of heights I developed and a counselor weekly for all the other horrible things I've been feeling

Tomorrow I go back to a work site for the first time since my panic attack and I'm scared. It's not the site of the accident, thankfully I never have to go back there again, but it's the same industry all the same. I'm only going for exposure therapy purposes so I'll be there for 2 hours tomorrow.

 I know I'm going to be safe but I also know I'm going to have an increase in all my symptoms. Conquering my fear of heights has been the most challenging experience of my life. Exposing myself to a fear over and over left me raw and filled with anxiety. 

I just had a few weeks break over Christmas and I finally feel like I'm managing my symptoms. I'm terrified of the flashbacks, anxiety, anger, irritability and all the other things I know that are going to get bad again until I master this fear as well. I'm scared of the looks my coworkers in this macho industry are going to give me and the gossip about me that's going to happen for being gone so long and for needing to do therapy at the workplace. I know I shouldn't feel this way but I'm deeply embarrassed to be doing exposure therapy at work.

616c380ec7e2787b3631ac40	2485_ptsd	"Want to Share a bit of my Story (TW: sexual abuse) So right now I'm going through a formal process of bringing ti light some sexual harassment I've suffered, and it's triggered me badly regarding the sexual abuse I endured as a very young adult. I have rarely spoken about it since it happened. I was disssauded from being public about it, and I now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. 

Because being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. Now I'm realizing I want to be more open, but I thought the Internet is a good place to start. Part of my issue with sharing is that I can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although I logically know that of course people have. 

This story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile:

Well I began being groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17. I was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so I was the perfect target  At age 18 he started with the sexual advances and I was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. 

He was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was I ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. His wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and I had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. 

And meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). 

In the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.

There were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.

 While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. 

This man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. I never got to complete my university degree because I was trapped under him when I should have been there. Also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now I have several quite severe chronic health conditions.

 I completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. Because I can't work, I can't afford proper health care or therapy. I have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and I don't think I'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. 

I don't live with a victim mentality but I think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me.

Thank you for reading my account because I need to get it out."

I was diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, Depression etc, etc after I came out of a coma from a failed suicide attempt in 2014. Many things/instances led me down the path I am currently on... childhood abuse (physical, sexual, mental) onto a lifetime of abuses (again physical, sexual, mental) and other tragedies mixed in like the death of my daughter...

Well, onto my current issue.. I had deactivated Facebook when I got out of the hospital. Besides that my memory was mush, people on that account had known what was occurring, contributed to or even blamed me for ""letting myself be tortured "". So it was wise to end communication....

I recently went back onto that account to ask for help. I had created a gofundme account as living on disability sucks, and I needed a little help to start earning my own money again. (I have a separate Facebook I just opened 7mo ago for family only and have been fine with that).

So with getting back on this old account, I was reading comments like ""if there is anything I can do to help"", so I thought I would give it a try... while trying to ignore the post from the woman who had an affair with my husband calling me a ""dear friend"" while I was in a coma and could not lose my ever loving mind on her.

You can guess where this is going... I am back to being ANGRY, HURT, BETRAYED , and a very unhealthy dose of self hatred /loathing constantly. These are people who knew what was going on, the pain I was in and still in and are seriously responding with things like ""glad things are going good for you"".

I am accustomed to not being heard when I speak, cry or beg for mercy... why was I such a fool to tell these people I am still suffering? Why did I try for help? Why did I think they cared? Is my brain so muddled that I convinced myself I mattered to these people? 

And last but not least... why do people honestly wonder why I don't leave the house or interact with people IRL?

He groomed me from a teenager mental health fourn and he was 18. He visited me on his way to a Europe vacation and gave me my first kiss, I wanted to wait to kiss and he just forced it. He wanted a BJ so bad but I said no and he was so mad. We saw a play and he was just grumpy and mean. I went to visit him in his state and I loved his family but he would demand BJs. He asked if he needed to get condoms but I said I didnt want to have sex. I was on my period too so I think its why he didnt do more to me. I always wanted to go to Sedona and Lowell Observatory and he took me there on our trip but he locked me in the hotel room, we never went to the observatory or even Lowell. He made me grind/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said ""but think about how id feel"" and pushed me down. He grinded into me and I felt himself kinda push in trough my underwear and I felt scared. I went home and we broke up a few months later after he moved to Germany and I just set my relationship as with someone else to get him to leave me cause I kept trying but hed make me feel bad ( I was 18 and dumb...) 

I only told my twin but never my mom. She would NEVER understand.  I had another abusive bf this year (23 years old) and he was VERY misogynist. Like an incel. He hid it and it came out later on. He knew of my PTSD and all his rape jokes made me freak out and cry. He said the last time we fooled around he would cover my mouth and ignore me saying no and I freaked out idk why hed say that and I left a few weeks later. 

I now am seeing a new guy, but hes 100% diff than anyone. We were bffs. Hes sensitive, kind, funny, sweet, very dorky and very loving in his heart. He feels like the boy me. He is very sexually intelligent and patient. After my trauma at 18 I decided I want to wait till marriage so I never ever have to have sex with someone who I wouldn't regret. After my incel ex I feel it even more the way he changed and warped. My current bf knows this he knows everything and he is fine with it. His last ex they never had sex for their whole 5 years and he said he has dated many virgins and waited till they were ready. All his close friends say he truly is a great man. Hes a unicorn haha. 

I really want to fool around with him more but I am very scared Ill freak out. I cant masturbate without him and I feel like a WHORE doing it alone cause of my past. I just want to be normal. I want to just have happy sexual experiences with my bf. I know he can give me them the way he is but Im scared ill make them bad. I just want to be normal. Therapy is so slow and its such few and far between where I make milestones in anything at all!! How does this go away?! I manage my OCD, my anxiety is improving but PTSD never goes away. I hate it. I want to cry. I was only 18 why did me make me do all that stuff. I didnt want too. I feel like a disguting slut I want to punch my legs till they are black and blue. I hate myself for what I let happen to me and the fear it makes me have. My partner gets concerned to trigger me, hes very slow and patient when we discuss sex. Being a virgin I ask him questions and he never laughs at me like other people do he just explains stuff kindly and sweetly. No pressure no meanness. I feel like a dirty mean bad person. I want to talk to him but hes also stressed at work today and I feel so mean. My therapist is on vacation cause of Jewish holidays :(  idk..

Idk....i just want it to go away already its been TOO MANY YEARS!!"

My LTR recently ended (~6 weeks ago) and I have been seeking treatment for what I thought was depression. I (f/26) had been very depressed throughout my LTR with my ex (m/26), but had never really gained much from the therapists that I had seen in the past. After the break up, I began to seek help, but this time was more vocal about the treatment I was receiving. The therapist I have been seeing post break up has been incredible, and I think my life is about to be on a major upswing. Today he identified that I have PTSD (verbal/physical abuse in childhood) and that there are ways to treat this. For once in my life I feel like there is hope.

5d29941a20c98f0017b6b85e	1480_ptsd	"Has AE been sexually solicited by a married man, then accused by him? I was sexually solicited by a married man in my church, then he accused me of soliciting him.  I don't know how many people he told, but I was told I could no longer go to church (unless I went before 6 elders to confess 'my' sin.)  I feel ashamed already, but also, if I talk about what he did, then I get him in trouble also, so I don't quite get what to do there.  You guys, any ideas?  

He implied to me early on that he was suicidal, that I should keep the relationship secret, (I felt almost threatened),  I still felt horribly guilty, that I was going to go to hell, and I still feel that way, even though I try to trust in Jesus to forgive all my sins.  But I have yet to accuse him to anyone, it's like I am still protecting him, when I really would like my name back, etc.  

I isolate myself in my small community.  I don't want to hurt his wife, or take his job away, or his family, or his reputation, even though he has taken my reputation for no reason, my name, and made me feel like garbage, and completely valueless.  Like I have no voice.  Like I do not matter. 

What would you do?  It's actually even more complicated, I'm just writing the bare outline here.  Every day, I make a decision to protect him, even though he has given me nothing but enduring and ongoing pain.  I don't want to see him hurt.  But at some point I deserve to have a life, and have my name cleared, at least half of it.  I don't want to treat him like he has treated me.  but doing nothing does not feel right either.  I don't want to be vengeful.  

Any thoughts?  Two of my brothers even made me feel guiltier than I already did.  ""Gee, like next time I feel like shit, I'll just call you guys, (my brothers) because I know you'll make me feel worse, not be kind in my confession. ""  

I was also doing informal counseling with this guy,  I had already had cPTSD from prior physical and sexual abuse in my life.  Thanks for your responses.  I am really interested in any practical or kind ideas, even for him.  Is there anything simple I could do, that would gently clear my name?  Or is it just going to get worse?  I also happen to know that there are leadership in that church who have had affairs, and done unethical business deals, cheating their partners.  Yet they go unscathed.  

It's a little late tonight, and it's Christmas Day tomorrow, so I might not check this real quickly, but I will eventually.  Thank you.  The emotional part of this is hard, I became attached to him, yet afraid of him and his helpers.  I may have to just become really objective about this, while doing what I can to respond kindly.

I then got a series of texts from her saying how much I need to talk to her, my biological mom, etc. It freaked me out and I've been getting night terrors since, and since I have been stalked in the past I keep having this nagging feeling that my estranged family are going to show up on my doorstep.

5d29941a20c98f0017b6b85e	2114_ptsd	"Please help me figure out what's happening/Vent (TW - Suicide attempt mention, panic attack). I've been dealing with depression and generalized anxiety for over three years, so my life has been colourfully scattered with panic attacks and random depressive episodes. I worked really hard to ignore them and wait to seek treatment until I was an adult, as I was afraid that I was faking my symptoms and didn't have a problem because it was just ""teenager hormones"". I also have never been great at taking care of myself. When I entered college this year I was walking in, completely in denial about my issues and unprepared to take care of myself. 


It took me only a week to have a melt down lmao. I had the worst panic attack of my life, I couldn't see and couldn't move and thought I was having a seizure. I quickly figured out that this wasn't working and sought a doctor who I later realized was not-great for treatment, who prescribed me Zoloft and Zopiclone, sleeping pills that I had previously had an addiction problem with. The Wednesday of my second week I immediately attempted suicide, had breakdowns every time I was left alone, downed pills like it was candy and was thankfully admitted to the hospital on Friday. There were so many fucking awful things I went through that week and I was out of control, and the suicide attempt scared the shit out of me. My therapist later told me the doctors theorized that my history of depression + my bad reaction to the Zoloft had led to my situation. I spent a week in a child psychiatric unit and dropped out of my college. There's so many other things I could talk about but this post is already long enough and that's not what this post is about.


I'm terrified of what happened to me. I'm in a really great environment right now— I have an amazing support system, am able to stay in a lovely home with understanding parents who want the best for me. It's been almost two months now since the whole ordeal and I'm in recovery from my depression, seeing therapists and have a new doctor. I feel better. But I can't shake the experience and it keeps popping up.


The college I was at has offered me guaranteed admission into the winter semester, but I can't go back. When I returned to the college a couple days after I left the hospital I was fine, but I couldn't enter the bathroom I had a panic attack in. I was also roommates with a lifelong best friend of mine during this whole ordeal who I am no longer friends with because of how she dealt with everything. I can't stand the thought of going back to the college, the one I walked around in a drug-fuelled stupor and the one that contains an ex-childhood friend who dealt with my episode in the worst possible way. I'm also intensely afraid of going back to the way I used to be. I've never been one that's been afraid of the future, like going to college— these things have always excited me. But now things like school, work, living with roommates/independently; they scare the shit out of me. I have hazy memories of suffering from depression at night whilst pushing myself through shifts at work in the day or at school and I don't want to go through that again. I'm afraid to live with others and cause them problems again with my issues. Maybe I'm just being lazy, but the idea of going back to things like that stresses me out and has caused panic attacks. At the moment I am slated to get a job in the next week so I can work until January, then live with a friend in the city until summer, but the more I move closer to it the more I want to stay home until the next fall semester. I'm just scared of taking on responsibilities and putting myself through stress again, and letting others down. 


I was actually supposed to move in with a friend right away and went to live at her apartment for a trial week, and I wanted to leave after about three days and go home. I also slept in her bunk bed last Thursday night and woke up in the middle of the night, and thought for a moment I was back in my old college dorm (I slept in a bunk bed there too), remembered everything I went through and had a panic attack. 


Other mini-things like listening to old music I listened to, feeling anxiety/stress, having people ask me if I'm okay, deadlines etc. all are very likely to make me cry or get really pissed off and afraid. I constantly feel guilty asking things from anyone and I'm so vulnerable to stress that even the tiniest little things get me on edge and cause extreme reactions. I'm also having a big problem with memory since it is one of the side-effects of abusing Zopiclone; so much so that I barely remember my life before now and if I do I am not emotionally connected to them (I feel like a completely different person now, so doing stuff the ""old me"" does also makes me panic). 


Sorry this is so long, I suppose this was sort of a vent as well, but I'm just really scared. I don't know if it's just a natural reaction to this sort of experience, it's PTSD, or it's just me being lazy? I'm saving this post so I can talk to my therapist about it but I just wanted the opinions of others. Is it possible to get PTSD from a suicide attempt/my experiences? Or does this just sound like a natural reaction, and if so— how long does this last?


The more things move the more I want them to slow down, and everyone in my life is trying their best to accommodate me so I feel bad asking them to do it even more. If I need to push through and do it, I want to try my best; but I don't want to push myself too hard and risk anything like this happening again.

5d29941a20c98f0017b6b85e	1561_ptsd	"PTSD from another’s experience Trigger warning for sexual content, BDSM, similarities with pedophilia, mention of parental abuse, mention of suicide

To give a little background, I (23F) was abused my by dad for the first 6 years of my life, physically and verbally. A family member mentioned something about possible sexual abuse, but this topic is very avoided by our family, so it’s never discussed. 

My older brother (29) was seriously affected by the abuse he endured, and now has his own set of struggles and problems he faces as an adult. This includes uncontrollable anger, violence to his girlfriend, screaming, throwing things (anything from a mug to a dinner chair) around when things don’t go his way, threatening suicide, and more. I lived with him and my mom for a few years like this and this caused me to be very sensitive to noise, particularly made by men. I don’t live with them anymore. I have been afraid and wary of men for my whole life, and part of me wants to keep it that way for my safety even though I know it causes me a lot of pain in my every day of life.

Without getting too into details, my long distance girlfriend (22) visited a BDSM dungeon to learn what it was about and instantly had a 70 year old man infatuated with her. He invited her to his house to teach her, and I strongly discouraged her from going. After an impact play session at the dungeon and some time, she asked me if she could go to his house for more sessions because he wanted it so badly. We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. 

This man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn’t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He’d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.

One of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend’s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. 

He continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me. I already had an extreme aversion to the idea of sex with men, especially old men, and I couldn’t handle that. I messaged my girlfriend that night that I wouldn’t be able to watch any more of their sessions.

Some time passed, she had one or two more sessions with him (I tried to think about it as little as possible while it was going on so I wasn’t keeping count), and my girlfriend moved for school in early fall. After a while, I believed that he was in the past and wouldn’t be a problem again. Eventually, my girlfriend and I discussed this and she realized how creepy this situation actually was, and she felt extremely uncomfortable with how familiar this old man was with her body. We agreed that we shouldn’t have contact with him anymore and she told him this politely in a text. We tried to move on together and leave this in the past.

And then he posted photos of her body on a BDSM website without her consent. She asked him to take it down, he refused. After a whole night of pleading him to take it down, we reported it and it disappeared. A couple days later, he posted it again. She got in contact with the dungeon she met him at, which he was actually longterm volunteer for, and they were able to get the photo down and promised my girlfriend they’d keep an eye on his profile and that they’d deal with his situation with the dungeon.

TLDR: Creepy 70 year old man consistently pushes my girlfriend’s and my boundaries during BDSM impact play session and then posts photos of my gf’s body in retaliation of my gf telling him she doesn’t want him in her life anymore.

Now I have an extreme on-sight reaction to any old man even slightly similar to this man. I feel like I’m going to collapse and cry and freak out the second I visually process an old man. The biggest problem is that I work at a drugstore and there are LOTS of old men who use the store. I’m terrified of them and I don’t know how long I can handle these extreme responses I have to seeing them. Nearly of my trauma related reactions have funneled into this and it’s more extreme than anything I’ve experienced before.

Thankfully, I will be started EMDR therapy soon, and I really really hope to see improvement one day. I think I might need to quit my job. I feel like I’m going to die when I have to ring up an old man, I can barely speak to them and I can’t look them in the eyes. I’ve cried throughout typing this and I am so scared about going back to work every single day.

Does it make sense that my triggers and reactions changed so much just by this situation I didn’t even experience firsthand?"

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.

This is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):

A couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.

Then, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to ""listen to her point of view because she had listened to me."" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our ""conversation."" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.

At some point in this ""conversation"" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say ""No"" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said ""nice talking to you guys."" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.

In the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way ""there"".  

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole ""me"" in ways I have never experienced before. In any case, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support anyone might be able to offer."

5d29941a20c98f0017b6b85e	2607_ptsd	"Dizziness - anyone else? How to help? Hi there, I’m not sure if the “advice” tag means I’ll be giving advice or asking for it, but I’m definitely looking for it. 

I have a lot of trauma. A very unstable upbringing and three separate accounts of sexual abuse, two of those instances were performed by family members when I was a child and the third when I was 18 years old. I have been working very hard in therapy (once a week for three years) and feel like I’ve finally broken really important ground on the unstable childhood aspect. I think that my body and my brain have made enough room for me to start really dealing with the sexual trauma in a big way. And it is ruining my life. 

I’ve found that my more recent symptoms with vivid flashbacks and memories that were foggy before is a VERY intense dizziness. It is completely debilitating.

I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that ""traditional college experience."" Truth is, I really hate it. I was diagnosed with PTSD at the end of 2018, alongside depression and anxiety. My trauma happened in February of 2018, so it is pretty fresh and still hurts. It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. 

My other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the ""Traditional college experience"" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week. It might be a long shot that anyone has experience with this. Regardless, can anyone give me some help/advice/reassurance? I'm not sure what to do.

5d29941a20c98f0017b6b85e	1583_ptsd	"PTSD from boyfriend of 5 years almost dying... It’s kind of hard for me to find anyone to talk to besides my therapist about this, because I don’t know if it’s the same feelings as when someone goes through this and their loved one actually does pass. 

A brief summary of what happened: The day after Thanksgiving I ended up convincing my boyfriend to go to the urgent care for a pain in his side that he’d been feeling for a few weeks but had gotten to the point where he was having pain with every breath he took. We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn’t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He’s not able to workout because he’s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. 

I was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.

I feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn’t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he’s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It’s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...

Not to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing. It’s just so much to deal with all at once and I just feel so alone like no one else can understand what I’m going through."

I was in a car accident over a year ago where my car was t-boned at an intersection. I broke my pelvis in four places, a rib, and had a brain bleed. The most significant, long lasting affect of the accident is the ptsd I have now. I have road rage, and at almost every intersection I pass it’s very scary for me and I often will cry out. I feel pathetic because I’m 26 years old and even with friends in the car with me I’ll cry out in fear uncontrollably. Most of the time in the car I’m a little on edge but am fine, but when crossing intersections or if I feel another driver is acting recklessly near me I’ll get very upset. 
I have this one very weird thing happen to me when I am sitting at a red light. It happens sometimes but yesterday was the most severe, as I happened to get stopped on a red light at the same intersection where the accident was, it’s in a town over from where I live now and I avoid the area so I am not over there much.
Anyways so when I am sitting at the red light, I start to feel very woozy, and I start to feel like I’m leaving my body or losing control of my body. I can’t tell if I’m passing out or what exactly is happening but it’s frightening and I’m afraid I’ll lose consciousness. I’ll usually try to shake my head and kind of wake myself up or open a window, and by the time the light turns green and I can go again then it will pass and it will go away. Sometimes when I stop the car on red the episode will start where I feel like the car is still moving even though it’s not and I’ll press extra hard on the brake and realize I’m not actually moving, then the sickness/pass out feeling starts.

Throwaway account because my boyfriend follows me .

Hello, I’m not exactly sure this will be beneficial for me but I  need to try I guess . From the age of 5 till the time I was 13 my cousin would  touch me and his sister. Fingering us “playing doctor” telling us that since it hurt it was our fault and something was wrong with us. See my cousin was caught with his sister but since I was so embarrassed I never said a things leading to her getting the help and therapy she needed while I dwelled with this self hatred for allowing it to continue so long.  I finally snapped and was hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I opened up to the psychiatrist as much as I felt comfortable doing. Which wasn’t much. Anyway I bounced between plenty of  therapists before giving up on therapy all together I’ve never really learned a good way to cope. (I had my first thoughts of self harm again recently and that’s scary to me I don’t want to fall back down that path) 
I recently got into a new relationship and I’ve never had a problem with this until recently. My mind likes to play this game where it twists the truth and so it has lead to a trust issue between me and my boyfriend. Which led to the flash backs returning, and it’s at very hard times like when we’re going to get intimate break down and start crying. Which makes me feel like complete shit as my boyfriend doesn’t deserve it.  he’s very patient and understands since I opened up to him about what happened. He stops right away to make sure I’m ok I just don’t feel like it’s fair to him (or myself)  Anyway I guess what I’m asking is how do I go about releasing this pent up trauma and how do I help myself cope?"

""OH."" 

I was processed out of the United States Navy, 13 years ago, on a medical discharge. 

***Honorable Discharge: but cannot reenlist*** 

I felt like a failure. 
Like a loser. 
Like I was weak and inadequate. 
I felt as though I had let my family down, disgraced them even... 

I had mental instability that I had not yet found a clear, succinct reason for. I had anger, bitterness, resentment, distrust, anxiety, depression, and so much more. 

I was overwhelmed and undiagnosed. 

Over the course of the next 7 years; I was misdiagnosed: 
-bipolar (manic-depressive)
-borderline personality disorder 
-acute generalized depression 
-chronic depression  
-obsessive compulsive disorder 
-panic disorder 
-generalized anxiety disorder 

 I was prescribed a few different medications to treat these misdiagnosed conditions.

SURPRISE! Nothing worked. 
Well... Paxil worked, but I felt lifeless... 
Zombie-ish, even. 

I myself had never even considered PTSD as a diagnosis, because: 

1) I, like so many people, thought PTSD was something WAR vets got. 
2) I'm neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist; so, I blindly figured my case was cut and dry amd that if I was diagnosed with something -- it was what I actually suffered from. 

Never in a million years would I have guessed that so many mental illnesses, developmental disorders,  (and learning disabled even) had various overlapping symptoms, that made it quite difficult for even the most knowledgeable Mental Health physicians to properly diagnose. 

Then I saw an article on Facebook about victims (I prefer the term SURVIVORS) of sexual assault/ trauma having PTSD. 

This was my AH HAH moment, and I felt giddy with anticipation of possibly being properly diagnosed; once and for all. 

I repeatedly mentioned to my Dr. ALL of the symptoms I had been experiencing, and also made a point to express concern that I might have PTSD, while trying to remain respectful of my Doctor's advice and years of study and experience in the field. 

It took a couple years BUT I was tentatively diagnosed with PTSD and my meds were replaced with an antipsychotic and a sleeping pill. 

This latest change in medicine seemed to work on my most worrisome symptoms -- HOWEVER, one of the meds made my face, arms, and hands constantly tingle while the drug was still in my system. 
Which, btw, made it difficult if not impossible to fall asleep. 

I once again went back to the Dr., my antipsychotic was changed, and I was also given an antihistamine that was supposed to help me fall asleep faster. 

The hope was to get me to fall asleep, stay asleep, and NOT have night terrors. 

While falling asleep was easier now, staying asleep was NOT, because the dreams persisted. 

I've since then added an indica/sativa marijuana blend to my medicine regime, to help with sleep. 

Some nights, I forget to smoke, and I have terrible night terrors. 

Other nights; I smoke and feel okay. On those nights, I sleep deeper and less fitfully; HOWEVER, I still have weird dreams. 

Smoking MJ has reduced the incidences of me waking up screaming and/ or crying, and shaking. 

There are still nights where I end up waking up from the vivid horrors in my dreams, and stay up, with all the lights on. 

I'm a work in progress. "	[]	[{'start': 1432, 'end': 1518, 'span': '-I was stalked and harrassed for 3 years by a fellow shipmate, then I was raped by him', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
5e5bbb34e3df7d39cb0ca426	1740_ptsd	"Am I overreacting? I was diagnosed with PTSD after leaving an abusive marriage. I feel pretty good most of the time, but still have triggers. I feel like my relationship with my boyfriend is strained at times because of my triggers/responses even though I’ve tried to explain it to him. 

For example, he sometimes reaches out and touches me while he’s talking (like when he’s making a point). Last week, I shrunk back from his touch and he looked at me like I was the Antichrist. I told him that I don’t like to be poked or touched unexpectedly, but he still didn’t seem to understand. This has nothing to do with him and it’s a reflexive response for me. 

One major trigger for me is violence, screaming etc. in movies...especially in the evening or near bed time because I have nightmares. I’ve left the room before and gone to watch TV in the bedroom when he and my daughter were watching a scary movie and there was no issue. I’ve told him many times that movies can be triggering for me. Last night, a movie came on where a woman was getting ready for a bed and a man in a mask was lurking outside. The music got ominous and I knew I had to get out of there FAST. I quickly went to the other room and turned the TV on to drown it out. I could feel my heart racing and my breath quickening just imagining what was happening on that TV in the other room. If he wanted to watch that movie, I was ok with it, I just couldn’t be in that room. He came in and told me we needed to have a conversation about communication and how those situations could be better handled in the future. I told him that I left the room quickly because I knew something was coming and didn’t want to see/hear it since it was close to bed time. I said it had nothing to do with him and I wasn’t angry or anything. He continued to try to have a conversation about communication with me in that moment. I resented it. I feel like I did what I needed to in that moment to feel safe, and because it made him slightly uncomfortable, he was forcing me into a conversation I didn’t want to have. He implied that I wasn’t an adult.

I have been suicidal at a number of points in my life, am an alcoholic and have done a lot of shitty things over the years to deal with my trauma. I’m now almost 4 months sober and am really trying to be better. Leaving the room felt like the right thing to do in the moment and was a lot better strategy than things I have done in the past. I can’t always articulate how I feel and I don’t always want to. I don’t want to always have to explain why I need to leave the room.

(Is it even possible that I kinda have that since I was a toddler? Because I had the symptoms since I can think.)

So first I really thought: wow, now I know why I'm such a fuck up and now I can do the real therapy and be normal for once normal.

Boy, I was wrong. The time in the clinic were the worst. The clinic is specifically for PTSD sufferers. And yeah, I like to talk,and I talked to many people. Most people didn't say anything about their trauma and what they suffer from and I think that's the right thing to do in such a setting, I think it was even the rule. But you know how it is, some people told me the worst you can imagine. Told me what happened to them. How they suffer. How they hallucinate. Basically told me their life is an ongoing terror. All I was answering was like: oh I'm so sorry. I didn't have it so bad.

(Before I went to this clinic I was in a general hospital, there they told me to NEVER talk about my trauma until I'm in the PTSD clinic.)

When I finally had my trauma therapy session. I told her everything but I didn't feel it. It was like I don't care. I apologized and said I am wrong here.

I still am sure I do not have PTSD. A new therapist even told me laughing in my face I don't have it. I don't have vivid flashbacks. All I have is this mental void I get suck in. In this dark hole, where I can't get out. And nightmares.


It really gave me a form of relief when I first heard my diagnosis, like I know what I have to deal with now. But now I'm... just existing. I don't have something to fight, just myself.

I am really open about not having PTSD, I don't get mad if you tell me you don't think I have this, actually I feel like an imposter and I am angry at myself that I post here and take the support away from real PTSD survivors."

TW: rape, sexual abuse

\-A little over 2 years ago, my ex raped me. There had been about a year of sexual abuse leading up to the rape. The manipulation and gaslighting and little things like forced kisses and groping fucked me up just as much as the actual rape.

\-A few weeks later, I met my current BF and fiancee. I truly believed he saved me from further abuse. He helped me cut my ex out of my life.

\-My BF is my ex's uncle (though they are the same age, they're family), but they are not in contact with each other and don't interact with each other's immediate family frequently.

\-I have had a lot of trouble trusting people after my abuse, My friendships are mostly people who my BF is friends with, people who he trusts I believe are safe to be around and I am more comfortable around them.

\-My BF's two close friends are dating each other. They have been together for years. I thought they were in love. They are extremely good friends with my BF, and I liked them and was very interested in being close to them as well.

**THE INCIDEN**T: My BF's good friends were apart for a few days. One of them told my BF he cheated on his partner with My abusive ex. My ex has told their friends that He raped them. 

I am in absolute shambles. I have spent years avoiding contact with my ex. Now not only have my friend destroyed his relationship to ""have sex"" with him, but I believe my ex was raped by him. I have to cut off a friend who I tried so hard to warm up to and put myself out of my comfort zone to interact with because I discover he is a PoS. And now my rapist is coming to me wanting help after they have been raped. The poor partner who has had their relationship destroyed is coming to me for help. I believe my ex is going to tell their family about what happened, which includes me since I am engaged to their uncle. 

It has never crossed my mind to blame somebody for being assaulted, and I am not blaming my ex, but I really disgusting, horrible, ugly part of me can't help but be glad that they can experience all the hurt they caused me."

It feels like I'm going crazy.  I know that being victimized once comes with a whole lot of other risk factors including repeated victimization and childhood abuse but I thought it was just that one thing. Realizing that I grew up in a toxic household and that a significant portion of my relationships have been, at best shitty, at worst abusive is tearing me apart. I thought I was just a normal, anxious, person. Could I really have been this in denial until my 20s?

Hello everyone, I'm new to this subreddit so I don't know what terms are used here or about tws or anything. Long story short, my abuser choked me during consensual-ish sex once but since he abused me so many times I can never separate the choking sensation from the trauma and everytime my partner touches my neck or accidentally puts pressure on it I panic. Lately I've been having neck muscles issues so I feel a lot of tension around my neck area and it's an instant trigger, specially when my partner makes me look at her or really any forced movement (like turning my head or sth, nothing more than that). She knows about everything but she doesn't know about the choking and I'm too embarassed to tell her because there's nothing either of us can do that I know of? I also feel like I'm exaggerating bc someone literally tried to actually choke her once and I don't want to trigger her and I feel like my trauma is Nothing compared to that. Anyways, advice?? how do i stop feeling like anything near my neck is him? I'm not in therapy but I'm on meds.

My mental health has also been really good recently and I haven't needed to use any of the following safety nets for a few weeks. But that doesn't stop me from stressing out.

I live in the UK. My parents are a major support system for me but they live in Spain. In the past when I've been really unwell they've gotten the first flight out and been at my side within 24 hours. Obviously right now if I was to become unwell there's absolutely nothing they can do. 

When I get paranoid or hallucinate I tend to go to the drs, not to see the doc but the receptionists will let me sit in a room with some water and help me calm and ground myself. All our drs surgeries are closed unless a doctor has specifically asked you to come in. When I get unwell I am a danger to myself and others, so losing this safe space is very scary.

All my mental health appointments have been cancelled. I was due to have a CPA (annual review with all the people involved in my care) next Monday and I see my care coordinator every two weeks. None of this is happening.

I understand why all these measures are in place and I know how important they are but I'm just feeling very alone and overwhelmed right now.

I ended up leaving that job shortly after I got divorced and I have a great new job that is way lower stress/anxiety/trauma.

I have talked about this to my old therapist and I am finding a new therapist (just changed over insurance due getting a new job). I don't know what to do about this.

He ended his life by placing trash bags around his head and securing them tightly. We believe he may have also used some medicine or alcohol to make him drowsy but we are still awaiting toxicology results. By the time we got there the bags were removed from his body but layed beside him. Initially seeing him helped calm my mind. I had created a much more gruesome picture in my head and truly he looked very peaceful like he was just taking a nap on his bed. We also found his cellphone, he made a playlist on YouTube titled ""the end"" and it was the last thing he listened to. The playlist contained only songs from Weezer, which happened to be one of my favorite bands. 

I was sitting downstairs in their living room when the staff from the funeral home came to collect him. The thing that broke me, was hearing them zip up his body. I guess at that point it became real to me. Seeing him at his viewing also ruined me. He looked nothing like himself. He was caked with so much makeup but I could still see the bruising. 

Since then, I cant sleep a full 8 hours. I think the most I've gotten in one night straight was 4 hours. I wake up continuously, often laying awake until my alarm goes off for work. When I do sleep, I'm often having nightmares.  I dreamed last night my son was dead. The night before that my cousin died all over again. 

During the day and at work, I'm exhausted, snippy, overeating or not eating at all. I have crying spells daily, the simplest things remind me of everything. I cant take out the trash anymore. It upsets me too much. I cant listen to Weezer anymore. I went to their concert last summer with my husband which happened to be his first concert. That is no longer a happy memory for me. I often get flashbacks seeing his body.

I explained this to my sister and she suggested it may be beyond grief, it may be PTSD. I have been going to therapy, and my next appointment is in Thursday. Any thoughts?

5e5bbb34e3df7d39cb0ca426	1617_counseling	"Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isn't it? Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger. You were betrayed by two people close to you.  That's a complex injury.  I don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life.  Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity.  I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again.  Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers.  If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while.  So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy.  Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like ""She doesn't regret the affair"" (you don't know that), ""She doesn't deserve happiness"" (that would be a harsh judgement), or ""She doesn't care that I'm hurt"" (again, there's no evidence of that).  Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her.  When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself ""What evidence supports that thought as truth?"" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile. A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here.  It doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge.  Forgiveness is not about saying that something was ""okay"".  It's about saying ""It happened.  I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time"".  Forgiveness is putting it down.  She. . .  (trust me this is true). . . she carries her own burden of shame for what she did.  For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden.  It only adds to yours.  Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? You're hurt.  Validate that hurt.  Honour that hurt."

Iam 24 years old and for more than a decade iam suffering. My current situation is really difficult. This year i wanted to go to university again, but my medical condition is a living hell. My problem is my body is 24/7 in an ""emergency situation"". That means it feels to me like my own body is a prison/enemy to me. I can barely breathe, i dont sleep well (for years) and my stomach is so hard to the point i feel emotionless. It feels to me this is taking 80% of my energy. Over the year  ""being depressed"" became the new normal for me.

The relationship to my parents is really difficult. I experienced a lot of abuses. Want some examples?
- At age 7 i was trying to sleep in a room with my brother in the evening. I was scared of ""monsters"" under the bed, so i asked my little brother if he could come to sleep beside me (children), so i dont need to be scared anymore. A few moments later my fundamental religious father came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground. Then he started to beat my little childrens body with his foot. My stomach hurt was hit by his foot. 1 Minute later my mum came to him, but she just observed and didnt do anything. Then it began to hurt so much, i was thinking i would die. So i crawled on my knees to my mothers feet and told her  ""mommy please tell him to stop"". But he kept going by this time punching me in the face, so blood came out of my nose. As he noticed the blood, he grabbed me by my t-shirt and pulled me like a dog to the bathroom, where he forced me to wash my blood. I was so little i couldnt reach the water so he gave me something to stand above. While cleaning the blood i was crying and most importantly my body was vibrating enormously.

- At age 8 i should take my little brother to play with my friend outdoors. Like most children i wanted to play with my own friends and don't want to ( Alone the fact letting a 5years and 8 years old playing for several hours alone on the street is crazy). Then my father saw me coming down the street and asked where i was, i said ""i was on the playground"". As he knew i didnt take my brother with me, he was so aggressive i got scared of him. I literally was so scared i began to run away from him. I ran the street down and now comes the crazy thing. He began to run wild after me and i screamed as loud as a i could ""HELP"", but nobody noticed. As i couldnt run anymore, i instinctively put my hands before my face, in fear he would punch me in the face. 

-At Age 6 i behave badly in the opinion of my parents and they scared to beat me, so i left the building block and waited infront of the bus stop for several hours in the cold. I Brief the whole time and each time a bus come by (every 20 minutes) i started to control it, so no stranger noticed me. Every two minutes i looked to the door, to look if they let me in again.

- At age 16 i was really hungry and cooked a little meal for myself. My father told me i should share it with my brother. I told him no, there is enough left he can cook for himself, he is old enough. He was so angry he took my plate with the food on it and threw it in front of me into the garbage. Then he became more aggressive and and destroyed the plate with a spoon in front my eyes and forced me to clean everything up. At this time school already was really hard for me emotional, so i cried silently desperate while cleaning everything.

- One day at age 15 or so he came in a aggressive mood in my childrens room ( dont remember why), we had a discussion and then began to threat me by coming really near to me, holding his fingers between his teeths saying ""iam craazy""."

5e4bc0c29b9a2e01310c6506	2430_ptsd	"Having a hard time opening up to loved ones TW for all of this (rape, assault)

I’m 20 years old, female. When I was freshly 16, I was raped during a party in a small apartment, with the door open, and nobody helped me. I began acting out and getting in a lot of trouble after this, ultimately landing myself in acute inpatient for suicidal thoughts. I wrote my parents a letter telling them what happened to me, and social workers had to come in the hospital and report it with me. They never, ever contacted me or my parents EVER again. That alone is its own damage. 
2 years later, freshly 18 now, I began working as a houseman in a hotel. This means I cleaned everything except for inside the actual rooms. Well, there was a man that would stay Monday-Thursday for his construction job. He took an interest in me quickly, asking my age, where I go to school, then progressing into telling me I have “beautiful bedroom eyes” and “pure ness in my smile” I knew he was up to something. He then began asking me which car is mine, when do I get off work, will my parents be waiting on me to come home from work tonight, etc. I began to be paranoid even when I left work, getting trapped in moments of my 16 year old self, thinking nobody cares what would happen to me, because after all, the police don’t care about me.  At one point he entered the lady’s restroom where I was cleaning, had me in a corner, touched my arm and asked how I like the new job. :( 
One day, and this is so hard for me to tell because it became a repressed memory until my second hospitalization in October 2019, I was vacuuming the second floor hallway. Humming to myself probably, at the very start of this floor, the door to my left opened quickly. An arm, with orange hair and freckles, oh my god this is it, an arm grabs me. It was the man. He held me just inside the room, my left foot in the doorway. He told me to look in his eyes, gripped my arm tighter, and held me there. I was thinking to myself that this is it, he has me. He could’ve done whatever he wanted. It felt like my eyes were looking into his for years, and his eyes, they were like... glass. Empty, yet fiery.  My mind made me see myself, naked, beaten, raped, and left all alone in the woods to rot. He let me go and I finished my shift. I was in a state of denial, showing up to my following shift in the morning. When I got to the second floor again, I actually passed out, and I’ve never passed out! I completely fell to the ground, it felt like I swallowed a rock. 
Long story, but my entire 2018 consisted of horrible paranoid thoughts and migraines, but I had forgotten this incident for a long time, so my therapist and I had a hard time getting it under control. Now that I remember, my life is bad. I have also borderline personality disorder that causes me MUCH distress on a daily basis, but now I’m miserable. I have flashbacks during the day time, I can’t even take the trash out alone. I’ve lost all my friends. My relationships are shallow and meaningless, except for my boyfriend. I never feel safe. I have gotten to the point of accusing my father of trying to rape me (absolutely delusional, he’s never touched me) and had similar accusations to my friends and even my boyfriend at some points. Sometimes, when the flashbacks are bad and I can’t afford to buy my medical marijuana, I get stuck in loops of seeing my dead and raped body again. It’s horrible. I’m scared to tell my family what happened because it seems like... nothing happened. Nothing happened but I spend everyday asking myself if this existence is even fucking worth it.

It seems like no matter how “ok” I feel during the day, my body just resorts back into that place of being attacked and feeling so confused and heartbroken as I was the night it happened. I’ve tried non habit forming sleep aides and I really don’t want to get a prescription bc honestly I can’t trust myself with one yet. I just want someone to tell me this will all go away on its own and I can forget my abuser ever existed but I have a haunting feeling it’s not easy ☹️ I can’t seem to find peace til the sun comes up and as a mom of two this is seriously starting to catch up to me.

although im still on the younger side, i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse just everything in which i am grateful for because it has made me very tough and able to relate with others.. i was dead sure i could handle anything but this . this has turned my world upside downn. it happened last july and i am much better mentally now but i still struggle with ptsd and triggers... i met this kid wonderful heart but misguided (not an addict)  and still has that feeling of invincibility..anyways we were in my room and the first incident we were on my bed and he was holding himself up on top of me kissing me and then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless . ill admit my first reaction was wrong, i was scared, and didnt realize his breathing and heart were stopping i was just shaking him yelling his name.. luckily he popped up and was like what happened wherr am i.. but quickly fell back into his high .. i knew from there something wasnt right so i was on high alert  (he had apparently taken stuff before he got to my house that i was guessing but wasnt sure).. after that he  snorted one in front of me i begged him to stop but he wouldnt and i couldnt force him to stop in that mindset he had . he then went in to use my bathroom (separate toilet room from shower area) and i was like okay ill just keep calling his name to make sure hes okay.. ( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right¿ but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone ""stops breathing"" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn .."

651ac44e976df13fd9976888	2656_ptsd	"When you have PTSD how much of bein in fight or flight is legitimate or an excuse? My girlfriend has had PTSD since she was a teenager and has come a long way in her mental and emotional health. I try my best to understand and be supportive. It can be hard to always understand though. We have excellent communication and openly talk about mistakes we make and when we feel hurt by each other. It seems she often pins her mistakes on being in 'fight or flight mode'. There are a lot of circumstances where this is understandable and having been raised by a verbally abusive dad I can relate to an extent. However, it's hard to understand when a simple question, or text message, awkward situation sends her into fight or flight. 

I can't help but wonder how much of what is triggering is legitimate and if she's using fight or flight as an excuse for her behavior. This is difficult because of the level of maturity we strive to have in our relationship. On my end, it feels like she thinks that every mistake she makes must be because she's in fight or flight. Some of the situations sound like things that I and others have a hard time with too, but learn to recognize and deal with. It feels like she's not trying to overcome her difficulties by handicapping herself with fight or flight and other PTSD related issues. 

I really want to understand and help her. If PTSD is simply that difficult to deal with I want to know so that I can understand her perspective better and be patient. But if this is a crutch she's leaning on too much, I want to help her take steps to empower herself and move forward with her life and healing. 

My question is, does having PTSD send you into fight or flight over little things frequently? If so, how have you found is the best way to heal from that response? What do you recommend I do to better support my girlfriend? 

Edit: the bein in the title should be being. 

Edit 2: Thank you all for your input. It's helpful to see more perspectives and how you each deal with your PTSD. Thank you for sharing. From what you've said it looks like PTSD can trigger fight or flight frequently from what may seem to be little things. I want to clarify, I made this post because I want to do my best to be supportive for her. I'm committed to helping her with her mental and emotional health goals however I can. I'm going to do my best to talk to her about her triggers and just listen as much as I can. Thank you again for the suggestions. I hope you all continue to heal and have the support you need from loved ones. :)"	[]	[{'start': 540, 'end': 603, 'span': 'been raised by a verbally abusive dad I can relate to an extent', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
651ac44e976df13fd9976888	1634_ptsd	"Not sure if PTSD, but having nightmares two years later... Throwaway account. 

So, this is a reallllyyyy long story, but about two years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy who I found out was lying to me and who I'm pretty certain was manipulating me. (Despite his mom and friend telling me he was manipulative and that I should stay away.) Anywho, he was very mentally ill and seeking counseling, but I think he should've gone to a residential treatment facility. Alas, he was in his twenties and no one could force him. 

Anyways, I have nightmares about seeing him now and I wake up feeling so panicked and anxious for a while. He would get into these extreme rages after fights with his mom, and he once told me he wanted to kill her. I was horrified, but he was acting very different than normal, so I talked him out of it. 

We eventually went our separate ways and he lives very far away from me, but I still fear he will find me and hurt me, tho he never made any kind of threat against or was even mean to me. But I don't trust him at all. He also has a relationship with a new girl (she looks similar to me and his past girls in several ways, creepy) and honestly just the thought of it makes me sick. 

Oh, and the story is worse, considering he went thru basically a psychotic break and for a couple of weeks I thought he would kill himself, but I won't get into it. 

I'm in a happy relationship now with a man that I trust very much and who is incredibly kind, so I know I am safe. I just hate that I still deal with these dreams and fears. I honestly don't want to talk to a counselor about it because it's not even a situation I like to talk about with close friends. It makes me feel that horrified inside."

651ac44e976df13fd9976888	2473_ptsd	"How to balance managing triggers/stimuli and living a normal life Hey everyone how's it going this is my first post. In fact I only registered to make this post.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think a lot about PTSD until a year or two ago when I just sorta got hit full force with something I didn't understand. As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything. That worked okay for a few years, although I was really struggling mentally during that time, but then the wheels just came off at some point where I was too messed up in the brain to operate normally in society.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get these nightmares that were so bad that they wanted to use me as an experiment for a new drug that's being trialed for use by the U.S. Military. I forget what it's called but essentially it's this blood pressure medication, but when you take it you never dream again for the rest of your life. I mean these nightmares were so insane I actually thought I might be possessed by a demon and considered seeking help from a priest.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get this anxiety that got so bad that I could not turn my back to someone or all this other weird shit. I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from. It was like I was being poisoned surreptitiously or something. I thought I was a tough guy but this was like physiological in nature. It made me so sick sometimes that I'd puke for days and not be able to sleep and I'd get dehydrated and have to go to the ER and get saline and a MRI.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I went to some therapist because I thought I had an anxiety disorder or something, but they were like no you got PTSD. I didn't believe it at the time, I was like ""yeah right"", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood/brain/skull/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

I got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.

&amp;#x200B;

They operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.

&amp;#x200B;

They forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some ""creative"" interrogation or whatever) they never recover. This is a concept I'm only becoming aware of now.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is with triggers. In fact, it got so bad that I had to quit my job six months ago and I've been out of work since then and barely left my house in all that time in order to avoid triggers/stimuli. Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say ""hands kill"" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people. If I trust someone enough to tell them what I've just posted here they see me as broken and crazy and want nothing to do with me. So it's kind of a lose-lose situation and I've been on my own with this for about 13 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't stay in my house forever and never go outside again so what can I do to bring myself back into the fold when I hit one of those triggers? Even when I'm doped up on tranquilizers it doesn't always fully stop the rush of memories and sensations that come flooding into my soul. I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up cowarding out numerous times but now we're actually getting into it and attempting to work through it. Logically, I know that my abuser (ex gf) will not come back and I will never see her again and know that what happened, unfortunately happened, but it is not happening /now/. Even though I know this, it doesn't help.

I cannot physically speak about it. No matter how long I sit there going through the events in my head -- I can never speak about it. Writing is fine. But I cannot speak like something is holding my mouth shut. This is causing some issues with getting things out there for therapy...

[Some background: I was raped numerous times, have gotten blackout drunk to the point I couldn't move and just lay there to try and be okay with the sexual advances, guilted, emotionally and mentally abused, manipulated, was made into the abuser somehow, etc.
This happened right after high school with an older woman (I am FTM) around 4 to 5 years ago now. I still have nightmares about being raped again or her coming back. I cannot go to some places without a panic attack happening or being extremely uncomfortable. I cannot say her name.]

When bringing it up or talking about it, I disassociate intensely and just forget what I say, forget what happened, and don't remember what happened in therapy once I come back.
I've planned on writing about events that I can remember and giving them to my therapist to read.

But is there a way or does anyone have experience or advice in keeping yourself grounded through it? Disassociating throughout my session is not helping but I can't find a way to stay."

651ac44e976df13fd9976888	2481_ptsd	*nsfw?* Attempted suicide for the 20 something time last week. Therapist said there’s a high chance I will end up dead by my own hand. I (26f) don’t want to go into a lot of detail because I’m still processing everything. I had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. Last Wednesday I drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. They took me to the nearest hospital where I actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me. I’ve literally lost count of how many attempts I’ve made, but I know it’s in the 20 range. Most of them occurred in a 3 month period about 5 years ago, but my first attempt was at 13. My therapist (who I switched to about 6 months ago as my last therapist was useless) told me very bluntly that if I don’t get my shit together that I will die by my own hand before I die of old age. She said people like me often don’t make it. She also said my parents expect that I will die from suicide. It shook me to my core. It was my first attempt in over 4 years and it was different than the others. This attempt terrified me. I don’t remember much of it. It’s like a few days later I woke up from horrible nightmare thinking what the fuck have I done. I don’t want to die. I don’t want my ex to have this much control over me years after I broke up with him. Has anyone told you anything similar? How did you cope? Maybe if I just hide in bed the rest of my life I’ll live to be 80. She said I can do it, but I need to realize the harsh truth of the matter that I have already beat the odds too many times. I feel unfixable. Will I be broken forever? Will I live until I’m 80? I really hope so, but now I’m not so sure. Attempting suicide became a coping mechanism for me years ago but I thought after a year and a half of therapy I could go the rest of my life without an attempt. I don’t know what I’m looking for, any help I guess.

In February 2019 my therapist diagnosed me with PTSD due to a sexually abusive, manipulative, compulsive liar relationship I was in in 2010. It was short, but very intense and I did not go to therapy properly for it til this past November. (2018) 2018 I was in a serious relationship for the first time since that abusive relationship and so some of the things that trigger me would not have come up until then because they are related to being in an intimate relationship. 

This relationship was so good and I was so excited because I felt like I learned that I could love and trust. Then for some reason, it started to become rocky and this is when my episodes really ramped up. I did not truly understand that I was having flashbacks until after it was all over but essentially this SO told me that ""whatever I was doing"" to address my PTSD wasn't working and that I had ""lost the ability"" to control my emotions and I was not as resilient as I used to be. I would get so mad and upset and irrational and he would too. After my worst flashback he did not speak to me for 2 weeks - because he needed space. (I don't blame him, but it was excruciating and I felt so much shame because I was reeling from the trigger) After the 2 weeks he broke up with me.

This all cut me to my core. Now, 7 months later, I'm finally coming out of the haze of sadness from that relationship ending. I'm in grad school for Social Work, I have my own apartment, I have two jobs and an internship. I'm doing what I wanted to do!! But I still am feeling so dejected and also really struggling to make friends because I'm nearly 30 and it's hard to make new friends but also I'm realizing, because I'm afraid to get close to people in case I have a trigger moment and they can't take it. 

I don't know if anyone has any thoughts but I just feel really small and alone and I have appreciated reading your posts so I thought I would reach out.

Peace and comfort to you. &lt;3"	[]	[{'start': 306, 'end': 366, 'span': 'sexually abusive, manipulative, compulsive liar relationship', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
651ac44e976df13fd9976888	2352_ptsd	"Triggered by my boyfriend, I don't know how to move forward * TRIGGER WARNING * 


So I have been dating this guy for a few months, and things have moved quite quickly for us. I took the step to be up front about my PTSD and trauma and triggers, and he was extremely positive and helpful! He has always been supportive. 
However, about a week ago, I was at his house, and my mind was absolutely locked onto thoughts involving a recent trauma, I was raped in the spring, and he knew this. I was pacing and out of focus and trying to work through it, and I told him that's what was on my mind.

He continually asked if I was okay, but would interrupt me if I spoke with asking, that was the first sign he really wasn't paying attention (I didn't want extra attention but in case something happened he would at least know which trauma it related to). He then proposed to help me, I said I didn't think there was anything he could do at this moment, and he replied with ""We could have sex, that takes your mind off things!"" 

I was shocked, but also so deep in my mind I didn't react right away. He assumed I did not hear him, so he suggested it again, and I told him now isn't the time. He then started playfully grabbing me and saying he was going to make me feel good, asking for sex, and I was IMMEDIATELY covered in this layer of disgust and discomfort, I felt like gagging. I quickly pulled away and yelled NO, and he then made a 'pouty' face and then turned away from me. 

I was shaking for about five minutes, unable to move, and felt so dirty and ashamed. 
I got up to leave (I was going to leave around this time anyway), and was very quiet when leaving. He gave me a hug, and squeezed me super tight, which made me yell STOP, and rush out the door. 

I have barely spoken to him, and I did get the courage to tell him (through text unfortunately) exactly what happened. He apologized profusely, admitted he should have paid more attention, etc.

But now my issue is, I feel gross even if he messages me. I haven't been able to respond to him. He keeps telling me about his days and then ending with ""oh sorry, I always make it about me,"" and I know him well enough to know he is not intending that statement in a passive aggressive manner, that's just his way of saying he feels he made another mistake through a text.

I feel so guilty because every strong feeling I had for him immediately vanished, I don't want to hurt him, and (selfishly) I don't want to be so alone again. But now he reminds me of the assault in the spring, I dont know how to move forward or mend this situation. 

Sorry for the long post, it's my first one and I felt context was necessary, any advice would be helpful. "	[]	[{'start': 447, 'end': 472, 'span': 'I was raped in the spring', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
651ac44e976df13fd9976888	2689_ptsd	"Six-hour lasting flashback I have to go through a medical procedure later today. In preparation for the procedure, I had to take some medications that give me back side effects. 
I’ve had to go through the same procedure a few years ago, while I was still in an abusive relationship. My tormentor ex used the side effects of the medications in order to torture me even more than usual.
So yesterday I had to take those medications and go through the side effects again. Little did I know, that as soon as the side effects began, they brought with them a massive flashback, that lasted for the duration of the effect of the meds, which was about 6 hours. 
I’ve tried different relaxation techniques, used my MMJ, had great support from my fiancée and even tried to take sedatives but NOTHING WORKED. I eventually fell asleep exhausted, into a restless sleep filled with nightmares.

2016: The hellhouse explodes in the middle of the night while I'm inside, catches fire, and burns down. No insurance. Bunch of animals die. Sad. Those were basically my only friends. I run away in the middle of the night and don't tell my family. Got 850 miles away. Drove from South Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, to Eastern Nebraska in two days. Stayed in my car. Stayed on the couch of someone I only knew from the internet. Rented a room in a house with strange guys from craigslist. Got screwed out of that and given the wrong date for move out. Had to leave asap. Rented a room in another house sight unseen. Hoarder lady. Cat shit in a room. No cat. Doors don't lock on the house. Random people show up and drop things off for my landlady. I have no idea who they are, they just walk in and leave shit. Can't find/afford anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

2017: Finally manage enough money for an apartment. Worked 6 days a week. Worked sick. Get apartment. Calm down. Have safe/private space. Hate Nebraska though. Feel anxious. Tornadoes in the summer. Hail every spring. Ice/snow in winter. Icy roads I'm not used to driving on. Scared of the environment all the time. Car engine dies that fall. Sink my savings into having to buy another car off craigslist. Can't afford to be without a car. Had gotten a better paying job at a call center during this year, but still struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

2018: Start trying to recover savings. That fall apartment building gets struck by lightning while I'm inside. Lightning. It also burns down. Insurance doesn't cover everything. Now in debt. God is pursuing me with fire. Reality isn't real. I am destined to die. I am being pursued. Something is after me. Why is this happening again? Brain goes to space world. Resume brief homelessness and stress of recovering after fire #2. Red cross offers no help to even transport me anywhere because I have 2 dogs. My phone is in the burned building. I have no family or friends nearby. I don't even have shoes on. Mental state falls apart. Can't take time off work long due to money. Cause problems with boss/at work due to emotional instability/unwillingness to take a schedule change. Boss says I should bring him a doctors note saying I have problems after I oversleep one day due to having a panic attack the night prior. Ignores that he gets medical insurance in this company and I don't. Tells me he thought he had been very lenient by letting me have 5 days off after the fire. Never get doctor's note. Live in fear.

&amp;#x200B;

2019: A chaotic mess. I want to leave Nebraska so bad. I am scared all the time. I am scared every time it rains/storms. I am scared every time a machine in the wall hums weirdly. I am scared when I hear sirens or alarms and sometimes mistake phone rings and stuff for them. I hallucinate smoke when I walk into rooms sometimes. I am scared when I have to drive, and terrified when it is in snow. I am scared of my bosses. I am scared of losing my job. I am scared of calling in when flashbacks and panic attacks interrupt sleep. I am scared of becoming homeless again. I am scared of wasting time feeling miserable only to die before anything gets better. I am indignant and frustrated that I cannot motivate myself to try any harder to get out of here. I am angry I do not have any parents to fall back on or ask for help or money. I am angry there is no way for me to easily get to Oregon. I am angry I feel as tired as I do and people are still mean. I am angry my job doesn't give me insurance. I am angry I make too much for assistance despite how like a stupid feral child I am, but seemingly not enough to afford consistent care. Don't want to do call center work but don't know what else to do that I can survive on. Want a hug from someone safe and somewhere to sleep."

651ac44e976df13fd9976888	2599_ptsd	"The moment that changed me and my thought process for the rest of my life Stay in my room until work, either sleeping the whole time or manic af from lack of sleep and minimal drug use. Not good i know but i have to start being honest at least w myself. 
I found this year that i enjoy dulling down my reality instead of facing problems. 

 Drugs make me feel something, while dulling down the pain
I don't want to escape as much as i want to numb my thoughts from hurting myself. When my thoughts become verbal my moods lash out on others and it makes me hate my existence that much more. 
Which triggers a wave of suicidal thoughts, self doubt, and a can't do attitude. 
I just give up
I am sick and tired of holding the weight of these ideations within the thin barriers of my skull, im growing old and tierd.
When it started, i thought i brought these thoughts into my head, and i would feel shame for it. For why am i doing this to myself?
6 years later its gotten progressively worse, i quit drinking and began a regaulr pill regimen  (also smoking marajuana) to keep myself balanced, or calm. I was less on edge, found a bit of happiness within myself and my creative side and began to feel human again. 
Now the flip side to that is the rap sheet of side effects that come along with these pills.
Stabalize your mind, sacrifice your body.
It's taking a chance everytime, adverse reactions and misdiagnosis over those 6 years didn't help. By the timei was aged 25 i had been on or around 25 different pills and different combinations within of those pills. 
By the end of my 6 years medication tweaking process, and 3 misdiagnosis, 6 hospitalizations, and pretty much a team of specialists, and a dozen doctors,  along w a cat scan of my brain in 2014.
It took hell of a toll on my body, and brain functions. My liver an kidneys wont last forever..
The runaround, a serious uphill battle im still pushing through..learning a lot about my mind and mostly thought process.
Why am i so mean to myself? 

 and as of today my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder bi polar type, i struggle with anxiety (mostly social) and frequent panic attacks (which can be triggered by the way someone i know looks me wrong) me being called sensitive would be a huge understatement. Around the time of my first hospitalization in 2009 i witnessed my friend and roommate at the time get beat within an inch from his life with brass knuckles to the face. 
I remember nothing past the porch where he laid still, getting beat on our own front lawn repeatedly. 
My mind permanently blocked that from me.Next time i have a memory from that moment im looking over him-- laying in the blood soaked grass, in total shock. His face was a blood puddle, in panic mode i went and scooped him from his back to his feet. At that second i embraced his tall frail figure as his wounds dripped down onto my suicidal tendencies shirt (oh the irony)  my arms wrapped all the way around his body, for i just wanted him to feel safty or comfort. Grabbing him by the hand i guidedus to a safer space indoors.
Around me was a blur, friends and neighbors scolded me, for ""he could have a neck or back injury! Leave him laying!"" 
I was not only in shock, but also processing a violent and traumatic event that changed my life forever. 
I was scared, he was petrified. 
I told all the neighbors and by standers basically to fuck off and
As for my friend- now gushing blood from his cuts, eye sockets, mouth and nose. 
just like a skipping cd in your old walkman, he was stuck in a constant shuddering loop fearing for his life. 
""They're going to come back and kill me""
Over and over and over and over..
Once into our house i lead him into the bathroom, swiftly locking the door behind.
""Call 911, they're going to come back and kill me"" again and again as he ran water over his face, pressing his broken bone structure completely flat, blood pouring from all parts of his kind and beautiful face. 
He couldn't feel it, he could barely process what had happened, for it happened so fast. 
I watched him try to
Rinse all the blood away only more would streamout.&amp;Panic struck, the ambulance was now on its way but inwas starting to expierence by first delusion. 
After that summer i didn't see my friend again until 10 years later. 
What i said to him was, i have been through so much since then that stemmed from that dark moment in our past, struggled with literal demons inside my head, woken up to images of corpses laying in my bed. 
But i will never know how you managed to stay so strong, so beautiful, and so kind even after something so awful could happen. 
I have no idea how he did it i said, how he pulled through and came out on top.
Dude, he could have been beat to death if someone hadn't stepped in. 

One of the moments that shaped me, made me grow and helped me learn so much about myself id never had gotten the chance to if our paths may not have crossed. 
Cos i usually think ""man, i wonder what life would've became if these blips in time hadn't happened at all?""
Maybe id have some sort of success, or maybe just no chronic disorder that effects almost every aspect of my life in some sort of way. Im unsure, always wonder, then feel weak minded.
Soon after we went through this i found myself laying on my bare bed, last nights last breath escapingaway as the mourning sun crept through the crack in the window where the card board had shifted.
I stayed home all alone with my thoughts that night. 
Not knowing how many sleepless nights, and waking nightmares mixed with violent hallucinations id have ahead of me. 
The mind is a very fragile thing, science knows little about mental illness as it is-so to see me, 4 or 5 days later after that night, days became weeks then into one bad blurred summer.
To explain it all in full detail wouldn't make any sense whatsoever -but i basically looked like your local circle k crack head on no sleep talking to the air. 
Sad thing is, mental illness and drug addiction look a whole lot alike. 
Your brain looses one to many days of sleep then all the sudden i think im related to  Egyptian gods, and my brother is a cannabal living on an ancient Indian burial ground, and theres a government drone disguised as a house fly watching me.
The house was alive, and teeth snapped my feet at every step.
The windows were breathing. I sawa glimpse of a body on the stain in the laundry room, had conversations with hairless rats and sat in a chair crafted from hitlers bones.
I could feel the chill air pass, i felt negative spirits, saw shadow people while christmas carolers sang outside my door.
None of this was real, this was just a snipit of the things i've seen and heard but told they weren't really there. 
I was awake, yet dreaming in gruesome splashes and disorganized thoughts. 
I was alive to exist. 
I felt pain all over.
Once admited i was so unrulyi wasn't able to be near any other patients at least half a day to a day. I spent that time in the yellow hallway in the nude and a pair of flats, pissing on myself while flooding my room. 
When they brought my food, i ripped my name badge from the tray. I ate my name for dinner, refused the meal, kicking it across the hallway.
Water began to trickle out of my room, and by the time they asked me to get dressed they saw..
I shoved all the sheets, blankets and my clothes into the toilet, and sink only to keep them running and flushing til someone decided to check on my crazy naked ass.
I just didnt want to be alone.
So i made sure they had to keep me close, and segregating an unstable lil girl who wants to die and has no clue what reality is anymore is inhumane. 
I spent the next 3 weeks there making no damn sence, i was completely detached from reality coloring with crayons, banging my head inbetween the door way and the wall. 
It hurt everywhere in a different way, but they couldnt make it stop so i would hurt myself. 
I hadn't showered in over a week, 2 nurses insisted on helping me bathe. 
Once in the water all i could do was scream, cry and fight them.
I was 20.
Life hit different for me young, and life got in the way of a lot of things but it humbled m

651ac44e976df13fd9976888	1436_ptsd	"Hands On Again 3 or 4 months ago my boyfriend put his hands on me.  6 months pregnant and this guy had my face to the ground with his hand around neck leaving pretty red marks on dark skin.  As soon as he let me go I scoured away like a hurt puppy and started having a panic attack.  At least I think that’s what it was.  I found it hard to breath.  Each breathe was hard to catch and felt like my first after deep sea diving.  I was shaking, scared to believe this guy just hurt me.

Today that ‘panic’ feeling came back.  What started as a back and forth argument turned into him ‘playing around’ with me.  Him behind me, covered my mouth and nose and just pulled my face back and my neck was straining.  I panicked because I’m 35 weeks now and the baby started tightening in my belly.  I couldn’t really breath.  I tried pulling his hands back away from my mouth to tell him to stop but his weight pushed me down into the couch making things harder.  By the time I got him to let go he started to pat my back as I gasped for air like the first night.  He asked me if I was ok..  I was shaking and I just repeated the same words as I did before, “please just get away from me”.  

I think that was a ptsd moment - I don’t know.  But since then I can’t even stand to be in the same room as him.  He says he was playing around but I know that wasn’t a game.  I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.  That was the scariest part.  It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion. 

I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know.  But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change."

I got into a really bad accident about 9 years ago, and after nearly causing another accident a few days later after swerving when I saw an oncoming car I gave up driving. For about 2 years I could hardly get into a car without panicing. However, 9 years later, I have no problem getting into a car however I cannot fathom driving. Bad drivers still give me scares, but thats normal I'm sure. Most of my anxiety now comes from lack of self-confidence in driving, and imagining things like people running stop signs (someone ran a stop sign and hit me going 50 over the speed limit) at intersections. The inability to drive has deeply impacted my life and I would really like to get over the overwhelming anxiety that has limited me, so any advice or suggestions are welcome. For what its worth, anxiety has impacted me greatly in other aspects of life but this specific problem is rooted in a tramautic event.

651ac44e976df13fd9976888	1707_ptsd	"Therapist Delaying PE This is going to be part rant/venting, part advice. I know it's long winded so I understand if people don't manage to get through it. Today was the first time I put this in words and finally explained it to my wife and now I don't know where to go from here.

So, I'm currently in therapy for PTSD as well as other things. Over the last year I've worked through DBT skills group to help me learn new coping skills in preparation for PE. But now that I've completed group and it's time to start PE my therapist thinks I'm not ready. She doesn't think that I've stopped blaming myself and that PE right now will only make things worse for me. I don't know what to do with that information because I don't know how to stop blaming myself.

A little background, I'll put as much as my brain will let me. Seven years ago my only child passed away. His death was in part due to hospital error. I know you're probably thinking ""That sounds like the hospital's fault not yours."" but hear me out. There was a sequence of events that lead to his death, and in this sequence of events there were times I could have done something and didn't. I made several conscious decisions as things unfolded. I saw with my own eyes that the hospital wasn't following protocol. I knew this because they had already explained the protocol and we had to sign releases giving them permission explicitly for this particular treatment. I knew this. But when I saw them breaking that protocol I was too damned scared to say anything. I was too much of a coward to face my fear of confronting the staff to say anything and I __chose__ to stay quiet. Later, I had a second opportunity to speak up and I again chose not to. Then, when things had progressed too far, they believed his heart was beginning to fail and asked us if they should resuscitate, but that it might not do any good. My wife was too scared to answer so __I made the decision to let him go__. I made the decision to let my own child die.

I feel like the hospital metaphorically put a loaded gun to my child's head and I saw it happening and did absolutely nothing to stop it. I may not have pulled the trigger but I saw what was happening and my own cowardice stopped me from doing anything.

How do I not blame myself for this? How do I let go of feeling like I played a part in this when I made actual conscious decisions that lead up to my own child's death? I'm being told that PE is my best hope and chance of getting better but that I can't do it until I'm ready to stop blaming myself. But I have no fucking clue how to do that.

I have a “friend” who is essentially a pathological liar and has a history of doing unscrupulous things, and I kept forgiving them in the past, but I was thinking I was ready to stop having that kind of unnecessary bs in my life and just stop contact with them, since it wasn’t doing anything good for my life and could honestly be dangerous since they have a history of suing people, making false accusations, etc.

But I heard on a post online that “withholding contact as punishment” is a form of abuse, and I do not know if this applies here. And if I claim that I cut off contact because they are not good for me, does that mean I am blaming the victim? I have been abused in childhood but I also dealt with my abuse in all the wrong ways, and I became abusive myself (not to this person) in the past.

So I think watching a crime show today where a woman was sexually harassed and not taken seriously, then hurt badly, triggered me? I am pretty sure it was mostly due to my own trauma including being sexually assaulted and then the DA office not taking me seriously at all is why I got kinda upset. And I will admit, I haven't worked much on that trauma since I'm also bipolar and those symptoms often take precedence over my PTSD. 

But it's been a few hours since the show and now I'm jumpy as *hell*. My poor nephew thinks I'm mad at him for making noise and potentially waking up his baby sister, but I am just startled as fuck when he is making loud noises unintentionally. I hope this goes away soon, I hate feeling so tense when I have no real reason to be. I just needed to get this out of my system. Thank you anyone who reads this."

First, it was all from how traumatic everything was when I saw my dad die and then when some things happened with my ex boyfriend. I'm now married and my husband doesn't believe that PTSD is a real thing. My mother in law just thinks I'm being dramatic about all of it. Last night, I had some bad nightmares and this morning, my husband woke me up by grabbing my arm and getting in my face (new anxiety meds put me in a deep sleep). I told him to get off of me and to stop touching me multiple times and he still kept doing it. It triggered everything and just made me freak out. I ran to the bathroom to be alone but he followed me and banged on the bathroom door calling my name which made everything even more worse. When I managed to get out to take some anxiety meds, he still got in my face and would not leave me alone and eventually ended up throwing my phone at me hard and calling his mom to tell her everything. As usual, he response was that I'm being dramatic and overreacting. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the nightmares and my husband and his family not understanding what I'm going through.im tired of constantly being told I'm being dramatic.  I see a psychiatrist for meds and am waiting to see a counselor for therapy. I just feel like giving up and dying sometimes because of all of this.

I'm freaking out right now. My rabbit is sick, and we don't know what's wrong. She finally stabilised today, and the vet was frankly shocked that she survived. He's running some tests now to determine what caused this episode (GI stasis and hypothermia, in case you were wondering). Thing is, this is a huge trigger for me and I have no idea why. 

The things that happened to me when I was a child were physical in nature for the most part, the only ""traumatic"" event I can think of that involved a pet was when my mother accidentally reversed over our (very old and deaf) cat while I was in the car. It was upsetting certainly, but compared to the other things that happened it seems ""minor"".

We lost another rabbit about 6 months ago to a tumor on her heart, and that broke me. I had to take time off work (I still haven't gone back) and that episode finally pushed me to seek therapy. At the time, I saw it more as the straw that broke the camel's back, but now I'm wondering if maybe there's something more.

I fucking hate this all consuming anxiety. I can barely function. I can't eat, I barely sleep, I've had constant nightmares, and I've just burned through my anti-anxiety meds. I'm even doing the hyper-vigilance thing with my other pets now, analysing their every move for any signs of illness. I know intellectually that they're okay, but I can't stop freaking the fuck out about it. 

Worse still, my partner is dealing with their own anxiety so I can't lay this all on them either without making them feel awful.

Rereading this it looks like I've got some serious trigger bullshit going on here, but I have no idea what it could be.

I'm just ranting at this point, but it feels a little better to have it written down. If you're reading, then thank you for your time."

65b94a06b8cd4e11cd4bdc16	2306_ptsd	"Guilt for Having PTSD Hi. I just joined this community because I was feeling alone in my mental struggle.

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD but I feel extremely guilty saying I have it. Mainly, because when I read the things most people who have PTSD have gone through, I feel like I don’t deserve to have it. You are all so strong and amazing and I don’t think I could have survived or functioned through even half of the stuff you guys have.

The reason I have PTSD is because I experienced loss and change and ups and downs very quickly and simultaneously all at once and I think the whiplash is getting me. But, mostly, I was in a very toxic job and I had two bosses that just sucked the life out of me. They teased me for having anxiety and tried to ruin my chances of ever being hired anywhere else. They were controlling and condescending and two faced and I got to a point where I could barely walk in the work building without thinking I was having a heart attack.

I’m finally out of that job and on to better things, but the PTSD still gets me. I still get really really angry out of nowhere. I cry uncontrollably for what feels like no reason. I remember all the things that were said to me by my previous bosses and I swear it feels like I’m reliving it all over again. I can’t make it go away.

I’m sorry I’m posting this. I feel weak and dumb for saying it on a forum where, like I said, so many people have it a million times worse. I feel pathetic that just a little job situation has given me diagnosed PTSD ... and I haven’t been in war or gone through abuse ... like how can I even have the right to say that??? I wish I was stronger mentally. I wish I wasn’t frail and scared and pathetic ... and I wish my body and mind didn’t see all this as traumatic to me. I’m mad tonight ... and I feel like my mental progress is like taking 5 steps forward and 7 steps back. And I don’t know ... I’m  just inspired by so many of you sharing your experiences. Thank you for this forum and I’m sorry that I hardly have any right to be in it."

Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another.  That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed.  The next two days were a repetition of the first day.  On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house.  I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple.  It was very hard for us.  His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had.  I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home.  There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot.  Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month.  After that, it was a downward spiral.  We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families.  We kept having the famous ""you're doing it wrong—do it this way"" argument.  After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started.  One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me.  I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one.  He told me to let him leave or he would hit me.  He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it.  He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me.  I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now.  I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children.  We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly.  He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change.

5cdd4d70982cbb001a587b0f	2534_ptsd	"My toxic relationship with my dad is still affecting me As a young girl, my father was always hard on me... a little more than my brother. Always strict with my grades (understandable), but he also had a control problem. He always had to control everything relating to my family, even controlled my mother to the point where she wasn’t allowed to spend any money from her own paycheck or wear any makeup to work. He was also emotionally &amp; mentally abusive to her, and emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive to my brother &amp; I on a daily basis (again, I always got it more than him). 

When I was a sophomore in high school, I was 5’5” and a healthy 135-140 lbs. I was a small in tops and about a 6 in jeans, so I was never really considered fat or even overweight, just healthy. During this year, my dad became weirdly obsessed with my weight. He would force me to run and do at home exercises daily, he would also weigh me about once a week. Now, don’t get me wrong, I feel like if I were the slightest bit overweight/unhealthy then maybe he could of approached differently, like suggesting to eat better or maybe join him in some of his workouts. But no, I wasn’t overweight and he FORCED me to workout. By my senior year of high school his obsession grew even grater. He was weighing me every morning and making me do more intense workouts to lose weight. I ended up weighing 117 lbs by the middle of my senior year. I was so skinny that I looked unhealthy, my collarbones would pop out. I wouldn’t eat much around friends because I was afraid that if I did eat like a normal person, I’d gain weight so I just told my friends excuses like I wasn’t hungry or I had already eaten earlier. They would always tell me that I was too skinny and if everything was okay with me. I would end up telling my parents and my dad would respond with “they say that because they are jealous.” 

If I didn’t weigh 117 lbs every morning- for example, if I weighted the SLIGHTEST bit over 117, like 117.4 lbs then he’d take my phone away for the day, it would also cause him to get mad at me for gaining an extra 0.4 lbs which would usually end up in a verbal fight and then him hitting me (at 18 years old- and even though I was technically 18 he still controlled everything in my life... my phone, the money that I made at my part time jobs, my car).  I would only get my phone/car/friend privileges back if I weighed 117 lbs the next day. Weeks would go by and I would be stuck at 118-119 lbs, and even though I was doing all the workouts he made me do and barely eating, my weight would fluctuate, especially during my time of the month. So I would go weeks without my phone even though I was driving from school to work/cheerleading practice, so if something were to happen while I was driving I had no way of calling for help. 

I remember not having a phone to take pictures with my friends on graduation day because I weighed the slightest bit over 117. This obsession continued into my freshman year of college when he forced me to live at home and commute to still have every bit of control over me. So, it was another year of weighing me every morning, physical &amp; emotional abuse if I didn’t weigh what he wanted me to. I remember one day weighing 120 lbs and he looked at me like he was disgusted by the 3 pounds I had gained and called me fat, and would point out and say that my legs were already bigger from the day before even though I physically still looked the same, but my weight would change because, like I said, it is normal for your weight to fluctuate a couple of pounds. This minor change in weight could be cause by lots of things like retaining water. This continued up until the July before I started my sophomore year of college. 

That July, he was mandated to leave my house because him and my mom were fighting and he hit her in the face and she told me to call the police, so I did. When he was getting escorted out by the police, I remember him turning to me and saying “you’re the devil. I hate you.” But what else was I going to do? He literally HIT my mom in the face, let alone the lifetime of physical abuse he caused to my brother and I. Fast forward 4 years.... I live with my mom, and my dad and I have a rocky relationship. I love him because he’s my dad. I know he’s always wanted the best for me but due to his narcissistic and controlling ways, he’s had an awful way of showing it. I suffer from diagnosed anxiety, depression and PTSD from my childhood up until my early adult years. He still hasn’t apologized for anything that he’s done, nor realizes that he’s the main reason I have those disorders. I’ve tried to tell him repeatedly that what he did and what he continues to do is not right (no physical abuse anymore, just emotional and mental), including making me feel guilty for things or bad about myself. He also blames everyone else for getting arrested the day he hit my mother. I don’t know what else to do to help him change or to at least recognize what he’s been doing has truly damaged me. Every time I notice that he’s trying to be a better person and try to mend the relationship with me, a fight happens and the unhealthy cycle starts again."

5b30dd61e223e800012bd935	2176_ptsd	"Emotional abuse during marriage I’ve been divorced now for three years. I was married for five to a man who was emotionally abusive, and I caught him cheating on me three different times, with men and women, using the internet. Each time it happened it was like hell breaking loose inside of me. Once was bad enough, then two more times on top of it. The most damning part was he pretended to care about our family and about me and presented this image to the world as the greatest guy and everyone loved him but behind my back and everyone’s back he did these horrible things like he was two people. I once caught him on social media impersonating a high school girl trying to get pictures but he destroyed the evidence before I could call the police. 

Now I am in a relationship with a man who is actually a good man but it’s like I can’t shut this part of my brain off that associates social media, technology, things of this nature, where my boyfriend is concerned, as perceived threats. When I don’t manage myself manually through the use of CBT and DBT from therapy, my brain is on autopilot in hypervigilance....anything associated with social media (which is how I found him three times) it’s like at certain times usually when I’m ill or tired or stressed it’s like I feel this vein of anxiety open up in me and out it comes...all the feelings that I felt that night, the other night, the night after, of the horror and despair of seeing him doing awful things behind my back. And I have to scan and stalk and research deeply into my boyfriend’s social media to try to quiet this desperation that’s roaring inside of me to find anything. It’s like I wish I could say I did it to self-sooth but the truth is really I do it to self-protect. If I go searching for it and find it, then it won’t hurt as bad. If I mistrust ahead of time and I make a discovery then I beat the terror and despair. The vein of anxiety only gets worse. And suddenly I see things that aren’t even there. A liked photo of a female must represent....so much. And I’ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can’t breathe I’m shaking I’m numb. And he is there just reminding me, gently... this isn’t happening right now. This is your past, this isn’t our present. I’ve never lied to you. I’ve always kept my promises to you. I love you. 

And it is true. I’m so ashamed of what my brain does when a trigger happens. The feelings emotional and physical all come back. It’s like I’m in a nightmare but I’m awake. I’m fighting ghosts of the past and metaphorically swinging at the man who loves me, trying to hit my ex husband (metaphorically). 

I’ve been working on this, been using my skills, and I’m not as reactive as I used to be. I can know what is and isn’t real like I can step out of the experience.  I can quietly articulate what I’m feeling. I can peacefully communicate my way through it with my boyfriend.

But the behavior of feeling the trigger, feeling the vein open, and feeling like I did the nights I first saw something suspicious and then going right into the compulsive activities of searching, searching, searching, searching, like I did after all the times, until in the past I found what would destroy me three times over and over and in the present where I’m finding nothing but yet making something out of it anyway, as if I’m on autopilot as if I’m awake in a nightmare as if  I’m reliving it all over again, and yet as if my brain is doing all this so I can “conquer” this thing.

5b30dd61e223e800012bd935	2214_ptsd	"How do you know if it’s PTSD? Hi guys, I don’t know who else to ask.

I won’t go into tons of details about what happened with me, but someone very very close to me almost died, nearly a year ago now. It was a very stressful situation and I was critical in saving their life, and I was very close to the situation as it developed (if you need more elaboration I can try).

Afterwards I didn’t immediately go to therapy; it was at least a couple months. I was dependent on my mom to make the appointment and I wasn’t insistent enough; I didn’t actually feel like it was necessary at the time.

I posted on another sub the other day about how my sex life had been really affected by this, and I mentioned other things, that I got panic attacks when I never did before, insomnia (or, alternatively, relentless fatigue), and very moderate depression. I had, and still have, in some areas, pretty sever anxiety with things related to the event (such as ambulances, sirens, hospitals, etc, along with more specific situational things) and I couldn’t drive for a while because I’d have to pull over quite often to calm myself down.

I didn’t mention PTSD in the post, but in the comments someone said that it sounded like PTSD. I vehemently disagree; I don’t ever want to be the type to recklessly self-diagnose and I flat out don’t think that this is anywhere near the level of PTSD. But it’s stuck in my brain and I can’t get it out.

My question is, how do you know? Like what’s the line, not in a gatekeeping way but in a diagnosing way? Is there some more moderate thing that I’m looking for to define my experience? I was planning on going back to therapy, but that’s not happening anymore, obviously, and I just feel like I’m being dramatic and ignoring myself at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.

This is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):

A couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.

Then, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to ""listen to her point of view because she had listened to me."" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our ""conversation."" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.

At some point in this ""conversation"" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say ""No"" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said ""nice talking to you guys."" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.

In the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way ""there"".  

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole ""me"" in ways I have never experienced before. In any case, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support anyone might be able to offer."	[]	"[{'start': 943, 'end': 1746, 'span': ' her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth.

5b30dd61e223e800012bd935	1684_ptsd	"A nightmare fueled week venting. Obvious NSFW or TW or whatever. Sexual abuse TRIGGER WARNING

Hello, I haven't used my Reddit for quite some time now and I've been having a crazy week filled with nightmares every night. So, instead of walking out of my room and speaking or texting my mom or someone who has a common past trauma thing... I post here while crying my face off alone in my bedroom trying to cry quietly so no one hears me. 

I close my eyes after sitting for twenty minutes saying to myself that I can't think of those things over and over. The moment my eyes shut I see a few scenes from my childhood. One of which surfaced after not showing it's face for quite a few years. I sat up horrified and had to refrain from screaming. I thought I had forgotten it after all this time. Nope. Of course not. I never forget that shit. 

Behind my eyelids I saw my brother digging up something fuzzy and lumpy from the ground in the forest right by my grandmother's house.
 I feel sick just typing this but here it goes. On the shovel there were bones and a larger lump came up and I saw the fur of an animal. I was an extremely gullible child who had followed my brother and it took me till seeing the fur to realize this is where we had buried our cat Smokey. A Siamese who I loved with all my heart and had to be put down because of a rare condition I was told was passed down from his mother. I don't know the truth but I'll just pray that's it. 

I immediately starting crying after the realizing it was my Smokey and ran crying to my mom after having my life threatened if I told. I don't even remember if I told her. That's sad. I hope I did. The movie behind my eyelids starts as fast as it started when I close my eyes for a second time. 

The instant it starts I see me and my brother hidden under my bunk. Me with my pants down cringing at something my eyes won't show me. I'm so thankful that is a blurred thing to see. In this scene I always remember my grandmother walking in the room and realizing we are under the bed together. I had prayed and prayed to a god I don't believe in that my grandmother would take him away from the same room and whoop his ass and cuff him but it was never spoken of... I don't even remember how old I was, my school counselor narrowed my trauma to starting age five. I guess she had talked to my mom over the phone about the apartment I described to her. Middle school was the last time anyone spoke of those things.

I am not the best at typing on this broken phone. I thought that typing here would somehow help me if I got my story, well a fraction of it, out there into the atmosphere.. this is only a snippet of the horrors I lived through while around my brother. My dad to this day tries to win him over and loves him so much and my mother has him under her wing at all times. No one talks about that shit. Everyone loves him so much while I sit here sleepless half the time over the torture I've lived. He probably sleeps soundly every night of his disgusting life. Having to wake up to my kids is the only reason I'm still here. Holy shit dude...."

But there was about 10 police units and one army truck at 645am .They bust in my apt w big long guns w red scope and point at my face they roughed me up and pushed me against wall w gun to my head nothing was in my apt and charged they had against me were dropped i had guns pointed at me as I walked outside I went thru hell w this situation for about almost a year until I got it resolved and it ruined a lot of aspects from my life at the time. After it happened I was having nightmares of police and swat teams coming in my house it would be dreams where the doorbell would ring and I would look outside and see police cars surrounding my house and dream would end.. I wake up sweating and in extreme fear.. I’m reminded of this when I see police officers in public now and everything comes back.. A level of anxiety and overall fear has been added to my life after this experience and I thought it would go away after awhile but it hasn’t.. i was wondering to you all if this sounds like PTSD?

5b30dd61e223e800012bd935	1535_ptsd	"I think I’m spiraling and I’m angry at my husband who can’t help me (tw mention of abuse, yelling, SA no details) (TW here) I have C-PTSD from a culmination of many things: abusive home situation, rape, and abusive violent romantic relationships.

I was proud to say that I escaped all of that and ended up in a healthy marriage. But I can no longer afford medication or therapy so I’ve been skating by basically.

As a kid, my family gaslighted me into thinking I was a walking disaster. If something broke, it had to be my fault. If I injured myself, obviously it was in character for me. But I am actually a very careful person and I work hard to appear “graceful” (also hyper awareness from my sexual assault - you will never catch me missing a step or tripping on the curb). It was normal in my family for my siblings to break something, blame it on me, and I got the beating and verbal lashing despite my proclaimed innocence.

So yesterday I had a cooking disaster. I damaged an expensive piece of cookware - but only aesthetically. It still works fine but it is no longer beautiful. I told my husband because it triggered me. I felt like I was falling into that family trap and had berated myself for an hour (I’m stupid and careless and clumsy and don’t deserve nice things).

I told my husband and he immediately starts lecturing me on how I shouldn’t have done that. I get emotional, “I know, I know! I feel guilty enough!” But I raised my voice so he started yelling back. I don’t even remember what he said but I felt like he was speaking to a bad dog and not his wife.

We reconciled some time later but the spiral started.

This morning we had a fight. I have a migraine and a lot of work to do. He kept talking to me while I was writing and it made me irritable. So I took a break to watch tv with him. He kept talking during the show. The show + his voice + my migraine made me feel like I was going to lose my mind. I couldn’t process anything. Construction started outside. I reminded my husband that he had to pause if he needed to talk. I asked him to shut the window. 

He lost it and started yelling at me again. That he couldn’t stand my mood. I started crying again, that I couldn’t process all the sounds and he knows this. He just kept yelling that I was bossy, selfish, I had a bad attitude.

I left the room and locked myself in the bedroom. He keeps yelling and slamming the doors. Huge huge trigger.

Now I’m scared and hiding. I have to shower. He’s mad at me and not coming to comfort me. I don’t want to see him and I’m afraid of having to talk because I just feel mute. I have to go to work soon.  I love him
But I don’t feel like I love him right now. I feel like he has been pretending to understand my ptsd. I know I wasn’t rude. I know I don’t deserve the yelling

5b30dd61e223e800012bd935	1810_ptsd	"I set myself back by thinking I could ask for help. And back to square 1 now... I was diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, Depression etc, etc after I came out of a coma from a failed suicide attempt in 2014. Many things/instances led me down the path I am currently on... childhood abuse (physical, sexual, mental) onto a lifetime of abuses (again physical, sexual, mental) and other tragedies mixed in like the death of my daughter...

Well, onto my current issue.. I had deactivated Facebook when I got out of the hospital. Besides that my memory was mush, people on that account had known what was occurring, contributed to or even blamed me for ""letting myself be tortured "". So it was wise to end communication....

I recently went back onto that account to ask for help. I had created a gofundme account as living on disability sucks, and I needed a little help to start earning my own money again. (I have a separate Facebook I just opened 7mo ago for family only and have been fine with that).

So with getting back on this old account, I was reading comments like ""if there is anything I can do to help"", so I thought I would give it a try... while trying to ignore the post from the woman who had an affair with my husband calling me a ""dear friend"" while I was in a coma and could not lose my ever loving mind on her.

You can guess where this is going... I am back to being ANGRY, HURT, BETRAYED , and a very unhealthy dose of self hatred /loathing constantly. These are people who knew what was going on, the pain I was in and still in and are seriously responding with things like ""glad things are going good for you"".

I am accustomed to not being heard when I speak, cry or beg for mercy... why was I such a fool to tell these people I am still suffering? Why did I try for help? Why did I think they cared? Is my brain so muddled that I convinced myself I mattered to these people? 

And last but not least... why do people honestly wonder why I don't leave the house or interact with people IRL?

5b30dd61e223e800012bd935	2481_ptsd	*nsfw?* Attempted suicide for the 20 something time last week. Therapist said there’s a high chance I will end up dead by my own hand. I (26f) don’t want to go into a lot of detail because I’m still processing everything. I had a psychotic break last week after a huge trigger. Last Wednesday I drove up to a cabin in the woods and swallowed a bunch of pills until the cops showed up, called by my parents after they tracked me down. They took me to the nearest hospital where I actually escaped then was brought back again by the police out looking for me. I’ve literally lost count of how many attempts I’ve made, but I know it’s in the 20 range. Most of them occurred in a 3 month period about 5 years ago, but my first attempt was at 13. My therapist (who I switched to about 6 months ago as my last therapist was useless) told me very bluntly that if I don’t get my shit together that I will die by my own hand before I die of old age. She said people like me often don’t make it. She also said my parents expect that I will die from suicide. It shook me to my core. It was my first attempt in over 4 years and it was different than the others. This attempt terrified me. I don’t remember much of it. It’s like a few days later I woke up from horrible nightmare thinking what the fuck have I done. I don’t want to die. I don’t want my ex to have this much control over me years after I broke up with him. Has anyone told you anything similar? How did you cope? Maybe if I just hide in bed the rest of my life I’ll live to be 80. She said I can do it, but I need to realize the harsh truth of the matter that I have already beat the odds too many times. I feel unfixable. Will I be broken forever? Will I live until I’m 80? I really hope so, but now I’m not so sure. Attempting suicide became a coping mechanism for me years ago but I thought after a year and a half of therapy I could go the rest of my life without an attempt. I don’t know what I’m looking for, any help I guess.	[{'start': 1324, 'end': 1410, 'span': 'I don’t want my ex to have this much control over me years after I broke up with him.

5b30dd61e223e800012bd935	2457_ptsd	"Please help me understand Hi everyone,

I’m having some difficulty understanding what’s going on in my head at the moment. I think I may have PTSD, at least, I appear to meet the DSM 5 criteria for it. The thing is that even the thought of PTSD had never popped into my head before a couple nights ago.

I was watching a cop drama where the main character had to go to a therapist for an evaluation. All of a sudden, BAM, that sounds a lot like me.

So here’s my story.

Last year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed. I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can’t and even if I could I probably wouldn’t share). Unfortunately, she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn’t save her. I had to relay all this whilst it was happening to my dad and my brother who were back in our home country. 

They were able to come out the next day luckily but I was alone all night.

Ever since then I’ve thought that I was just grieving normally for my mother. I do go to a therapist about it once a week. Whenever I talk to people about what happened they always say “it must have been so traumatic” but I myself have never used that word to describe it, not even in my own thoughts.

Now though, I can’t stop thinking that this may actually be affecting me. Actually, I knew how badly I was being affected but I just thought that it was part of the grieving process. I called a friend tonight and told her what I was thinking and she told me that she’s suspected it for months! She didn’t know how to tell me what she thought. I’m not mad or upset at her or anything but I am a bit shocked that someone could come to that conclusion so long before I even thought about it! 

I’m not self diagnosing but I would like to know for certain if it is PTSD or not. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and am planning to ask her.

Did any of you have this BAM realisation? How did you go about things afterwards?

Thank you for reading"	[]	[{'start': 479, 'end': 1014, 'span': 'Last year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed.

Dreams full of confusion that I'm left to either ponder or forget in the following day. Thoughts of the hidden lies I tell the world or the endless horrors I've lived. Thoughts of the never ending pain that I deemed fair in my life. But then that leads me to question. How are my horrors fair? How am I getting justice?  
I can't change my smile, only the intensity. I can't change my pale skin with the freckles, only the scars I put make up on to hide. I can't change my past and what others have taken from me. I can't change the fact that those memories are my horrors. Those my memories are my dreams. 
These memories give me comfort and pain. The catch 22 of my mind. They remind me that I've been used, abused, stolen, and deceived. In my dreams I'm lulled by the love I thought was there.

Too late meaning, my 11 year old mind not seeing myself being groomed. My 12 year old hunger being denied to stay 98 lbs. My 13 year old body not understanding that being molested was wrong. My 14 year old body was now the product of a 45 year old man and the countless nights he snuck in my room. Then my 15 year old emotions only wanting it to stop but too afraid to end it. 
End it, was what I wanted but it won't stay in my past. End the tears when he leaves, they only come more. End the long nights of his encounters, but they come just as frequently just in a different form. End the pain in my body, the feeling of his breath on my neck, the feeling of hands over my mouth. The end... but it won't. 
It won't since I've been told it was my fault. It won't since he will be seen as an amazing man, while he hides the fact he's a monster. It won't since he lives happy and my family has a new person to gossip about. So it won't.

                                            Sorry










So I've been hit with a ruler once I think and I was hit until it broke. I only recall this once but is this okay? I've heard many of my friends say that they've been hit too (as it's sort of asain culture). I remeber I was in trouble because I lied to my mother due to being afraid of being caught and hit again.

Is this okay?

I feel like I did something to deserve it in a way
Anyways when she was yelling at me I only heard a ringing noise and my vision started to turn black. I wasn't really able to see her but I heard her clearly. I remember that I didn't say anything cause I was too scared admit it to her and getting into more trouble.
Right now I haven't been spanked (or hit) but I just remember it vividly and I don't have the guys to tell my mother about it. I remember my mother saying how ""liars go to hell"", ""why'd you lie about your grades? I would have found out anyways"", ""why do I take you to tutor when you'll just get B's?"", ""look at me"" and ""why are you crying?""

Anyways I feel guilty... I recently heard she had rheumatism (I think) right after I was born. I'm the only child right now and I just feel like I have to get good grades so I can do something... I guess

Anyways is this okay? Are all families like this? I'm sure it's normal

5b30dd61e223e800012bd935	1715_ptsd	"Trauma &amp; Guilt - a letter to his new wife You. You, what can I say to you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry this is happening to you. I’m so sorry if you’re happy, and I’m sorry if you’re excited for the future. I’m sorry if you’re so comfortable with who you share your life with, I’m sorry I allowed that. I’ve been carrying guilt for years that I granted him the freedom to do this to another individual, and that I was so scared to open up about what occurred four years ago. 

You’re going to find out soon, and you’re not going to believe it at first. You’re going to be told bluntly, and you will reject it. Perhaps you’ve already been told, by his friends that are no longer his friends for a reason that you should know by now. I couldn’t comprehend it either, not at first. I didn’t understand what information I had just been handed, what it meant and what it was doing to me. Four years later I am still processing what it was and who he is. It still weighs on me as heavy as it did that night, but in a different way.

I mourned my relationship first, I had succumbed to what I thought was love, but was ultimately masterful manipulation. He made it easy to attach myself to him with promises of an appealing future. He had a way of convincing me he was smarter than me, and everyone else. You’ll be okay if you stick with me, the rest of the world is toxic and confused. We’re okay if we just stay here. I love you because you’re practical, you’re not like any other girl I’ve dated. They’re all crazy, you’re sane. You’re grounded, and you pay half of the rent. 

He was secretive to start, a few early discrepancies regarding other girls online. Inexperienced me deemed this normal, we could moved passed all of that noise - what counted was where we ended up each night. He kept nude images of these girls on his phone, we were not off to a great start. But I was practical, I was different, and I made him feel smart. I existed to embellish him, an important role - and he knew it. I was his type; insecure and accustomed to abuse. This particular trauma, however, is not abuse. Though there was plenty, emotional and physical abuse. I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it. He shoved me into a wall when I announced his lack of masculinity too loudly. 

He worked in security at a ballet school, often overnight. Based on the mistrust that was instilled in me early on in our relationship, the overnight work worried me. Is he talking to girls? Is he sending them unsolicited dick pics? Probably. By this point he had convinced me it was in my head, and I was massively paranoid. I was turning into one of the girls he didn’t want to be around, someone insane and impractical. But I paid rent, and contributed towards the idea of a future. I was being molded into someone who would love him no matter what doubts I had. 

He had some performance issues come up at his job. I can’t remember what they were regarding, or if they were even real…But he lost his full time position. He maintained employment with the same company at a different location, part-time. We got by with savings and my serving job. I got a call one day from his manager, Patrick. They had originally tried to call him, and I was listed as his emergency contact. It was not the first time I had received a call from his work, so I didn’t think much of it. I was at work when he called so he left a voicemail - I listened to it on my way home from work. He spoke as if he were talking to him, instructing him to call him back - and that they had to cut into all of the lockers at his previous workplace. He listed off a few of the items found in the lockers and wanted to be sure that they were his, and make sure everything was accounted for. There was a laptop, and a safe box. 

I asked him about these items but he assured me they weren’t his. I let it go, as I had many things during our time together. He was picking up a few evening shifts where he could at this time, quite sporadically. He would leave around 2 or 4, and return around 10pm. I got cut from work when the dinner shift showed up, around 4:30. I left work, walked south on Bay Street, east on College, and hopped on the northbound train. I got home around 5:15pm. I unloaded, changed into sweats, the usual. Cleaning was pretty relaxing after a day in the service industry, so I went to grab some supplies under the kitchen sink cupboard. Our kitchen counters were L shaped, and I always thought it was weird that where the space under the cupboard should have ended, it extended passed where the wall above sat. This particular evening I noticed that this was not the case, and somehow the wall had moved forward. I was frightened, I was one of those people that ready creepy stories at night - you know the one where people discover there are people living in small spaces in their home. 

It wasn’t the wall, it was a piece of bristol board. It was relieving for a brief moment - but that relief was short lived. I removed that board and discovered a safe and a laptop. Since that moment I’ve really repressed what I found - through denial or embarrassment, I’ve somehow forgotten in detail what it was I had seen. I still don’t know what journey I set out to after that moment, but it wasn’t to deal with seeing those images. That was my second mistake. My first was my initial thought - the end of my four year relationship. Logic was not present, logic would have been to immediately call the police - instead of waiting for him to come home to confront him about it.* 

If he somehow sees this - he will frantically come up with something to tell you to convince you I am just some crazy ex-girlfriend out to get me for breaking up with me. Or perhaps he has already set something in place to manipulate you into believing that none of this is truth, and anything anyone ever says apart from him is a lie. When I left Toronto, he covered his tracks - and somehow convinced his family and our mutual friends that I was not to be trusted. He was fine, and merely unhappy in our relationship. He never got the help he claimed to seek, he paused his search for child pornography, but not for long. It’s never for very long. Damaged people don’t get better without proper treatment. 

I think about this every fucking day. It’s with me, for better or for worse. I think about the children who attended and lived at the ballet school that he worked at - it’s such a privilege for them to be there, a dream. I think about the children that were trafficked and exploited - contributing to his sick obsession. I think about the women who are trafficked in Southern Ontario. I think about his other ex-girlfriend who also knew about this. I think about his family who are under his false influence. But most of all, I think of you.

6661c60bcb451a05028653f1	2458_ptsd	"Relationship problems caused by trauma Hi!

I had a very hard time during my childhood. My mom was mentally ill and beat me and my siblings on a daily basis and my dad beat my mom often in front of us children. My mom yelled at me for everything: If I laughed to much, If I cried, if I was angry so basically when I showed any emotion at all. If I did well in school (A:s were the only acceptable grade) helped her by being her emotional support as soon as I came home from school aka listening to her problems etc she would not beat me. But as soon as I did the slightest wrong she beat me and told me that she wished that she had just done an abortion etc 

I remember that my mom used to beat me when I was 4-7 years old just because I was so ugly. She pulled my hair and slammed me into a wall and she beat me and cried at the same time and yelled that I was a disappointment in every way. She forced me to have my hair up in a high ponytail or else she would beat me and pull my hair. I am born with a large forehead but the high ponytails only made it worse (I never wear my hair up now bc is how large of a forehead I have) I was also bullied because of that and because everyone knew that they beat me at home so in school they knew that I was an easy target, I remember just laying in my own piss one time because I was so scared after being beaten in school and scared of going home knowing that my mom would beat me because I pissed my pants. 

In conclusion my childhood sucked and that has caused a lot of problems now that I am a young adult F21, especially in my relationship. Me and my BF M21  has been in a relationship for 2,5 years and he is wonderful. The problem is that I am so insecure, I can worry that he will meet someone better if he goes away to work or just goes to buy some groceries. I am constantly feeling as if I am not enough and that he will leave me for anyone because I see other people as better than me, like I really mean every human I meet. I have a lot of anxiety and have a hard time talking to him about this, I really try to and are not actively refusing to talk but I often just don’t know how to describe it. I also don’t want to control him or let my anxiety make him shitty because it is not his fault, he has never given me any reason to even be worried but still I feel like shit. I feel sad sometimes and jealous when he hangs out with friends but I never tell him that he should not hang out whit them and he hangs out with them despite me having panic attacks and feeling as if I suck and that he will find someone better etc etc etc 

I am 100% aware that my feelings are not valid, I am loved but I just can not feel it and believe it. I go to trauma focused therapy (PTSD) so I am working on it and by BF knows about it and we always talk about it. He usually hugs me and tells me that he loves me etc and I just lay in his arms crying like a baby and knowing that my feelings are stupid but just can not make them go away.

So, Reddit or r/ptsd what do I do and am I the only one who feels like this?

I love my BF so extremely much and I really want to grow old with him and have kids and be together through everything but I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. As if I should leave him before he leave me and that this is an example of how fucked up and unworthy of love I really am. I just don’t want to hurt him and I know that my heart would shatter into pieces without him but if that is what is better for him then I want that. He says that he is happy and we really are happy most of the time but this ruins so much. 

And also, during one year I had this thing were I bought stuff on credit and it started out as what I thought a one time thing but then I used it as a coping mechanism. During that time I did not really understand that it was bad but when I realized about 6 months ago I knew that I needed to talk to my BF about it but I did not want him to leave me so I held it a secret for three more months and then I finally told him. I have ruined his trust in me now. I have never lied about anything and neither has he that has been like the most important thing in our relationship but now I ruined it.  We are trying to work through it and he says that he wants to be with me. 

I am a fuck up and just want to break up with my BF and kill myself because he would be happier without me.

We were walking on a large piece of machinery when the grating broke and he fell from in front of me 40' to the ground. I ran for help and was first on scene. 

I took 2 months off after that and tried to cope on my own for a month which failed miserably but after that I started therapy which started helping. I ran out of money about 2 months in as work safe hadn't started sending me cheques yet so I tried to go back to work. I managed to work a couple of days a week for a few weeks until one day I was asked to do a job at heights. I took one look down the ladder I was supposed to go down and instantly had a panic attack. I went home that day and haven't been back to work since

I've spent the last year working with an occupational therapist to do exposure therapy for the crippling fear of heights I developed and a counselor weekly for all the other horrible things I've been feeling

Tomorrow I go back to a work site for the first time since my panic attack and I'm scared. It's not the site of the accident, thankfully I never have to go back there again, but it's the same industry all the same. I'm only going for exposure therapy purposes so I'll be there for 2 hours tomorrow.

 I know I'm going to be safe but I also know I'm going to have an increase in all my symptoms. Conquering my fear of heights has been the most challenging experience of my life. Exposing myself to a fear over and over left me raw and filled with anxiety. 

I just had a few weeks break over Christmas and I finally feel like I'm managing my symptoms. I'm terrified of the flashbacks, anxiety, anger, irritability and all the other things I know that are going to get bad again until I master this fear as well. I'm scared of the looks my coworkers in this macho industry are going to give me and the gossip about me that's going to happen for being gone so long and for needing to do therapy at the workplace. I know I shouldn't feel this way but I'm deeply embarrassed to be doing exposure therapy at work.

6661c60bcb451a05028653f1	2434_ptsd	"(TW) A bad sexual experience when I was 18 still affects me, I’m not sure if I was traumatized Okay, I’m going to preface this by saying that I did have a moderately traumatic childhood, I want to contextualize things in hopes to give better insight. 
I grew up in a turbulent and dysfunctional environment, I was also tormented by my peers growing up and endured profound alienation and loneliness. My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I’ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they’d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn’t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn’t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. 

When I was 18 (I’m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.

On my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me. We met up and drove around, hung out at his place and divulged in deep conversations for hours on end. 

After a couple of times he became very flirtatious and made a pass at me. 
I was pretty sexually inexperienced and he knew that, in hindsight I feel as though  he fetishized my innocence (he casually) brought it up countless times. When we first started hooking  up , it was pretty vanilla and ..normal I guess.


Overtime he began to become really aggressive and rough , he was kind of coercive and disregarded some of my boundaries. He would choke me so hard to where I would run out of air and the next day my neck would be riddled with bruises (I was okay with choking but not that extreme). I have a visceral memory of how dark and sinister his eyes looked while he would do this. 

On one occasion he did something  I did NOT consent too and it really upset me, I consented you’re sex but not what he did in the midst of it(I don’t feel comfortable being less vague ) it wasn’t I’ve isolated thing, but during that instance I remember spacing out until it was over with..was paralyzed and couldn’t think. He took me home and gave the impression he was oblivious and things were fine ,  I didn’t tell him what I was feeling. I felt stupid because I am partially responsible for putting myself in a compromising position and allowing myself to be taken  advantage of, I also had such little value in myself that I didn’t want him to stop seeing me. After a while he ghosted me, and I was devastated. I was angry and felt used and beat myself up over it for a while. 

He also dated a string of girls around my age, I didn’t find that off until it was over though. 

I didn’t tell anyone about this, I didn’t want my parents to find out or to be judged but I feel like this was a tipping point into my descent of substance abuse and depression. 
There were so many other things that contributed 
To my depression manifesting and festering over time and this wasn’t the worst thing that happened to me per-say but it was the straw that broke the camels back. 

I haven’t had sex in 2 years  I don’t date and I wish that I could go back In time and stop everything from happening. I wish I could scrub it from my mind entirely but I can’t and I still have dreams about the whole ordeal.

I live in a very unsafe country. I grew accustomed somehow to the hazardous risk of my daily life (due to rampant deliquency) and fortunately, due to my residence in an upscale neighborhood, I haven't been really that exposed to the real face of danger.
Nonetheless, tonight, while scrolling down the timeline on Twitter, I came across this gory video of a young man (way too young, a teenager) been brutally beheaded after what looks like a horribly agonizing execution.
It seems it was the by-product of mafia wars but it occured in my home country, fortunately, far away from the capitol city.
However, the video shocked me so much that I can't really think of other things now. I'm really paranoid now that someone could break into my house and subject me to such a dreadful death. I'm paranoid about the domestic employee (from a poor side of the city) to gang up with others to assault on me in order to steal from me or something like that. It got to the point that I felt like throwing up at least a good half an hour after watching the video.

I have never considered myself sensitive to this kind of material. Actually I had watched several of them in the past but this one really hit home. 

I believe the paranoid thoughts (which I never had) and feeling unsafe for my dog and myself (due to a good part of the population being deprived of proper food and healthcare) are an episode of PTSD.

I want to thank all of the police officers, especially those fighting organized-crime for the daunting risk they take on our behalf. I believe that for the first time ever I understand how they expose their relatives and families and I really want to express my gratitude.

THank you very much for reading this and any help is appreciated."	[]	"[{'start': 749, 'end': 893, 'span': ""I'm really paranoid now that someone could break into my house and subject me to such a dreadful death. I'm paranoid about the domestic employee"", 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

Just gonna lay it all out, I know not all of it is especially traumatic.

hi, im 14 y/o and ive just realised my sister's boyfriend has been grooming me. ive talked to some people on r/SuicideWatch and r/survivorsofabuse and they were all very kind and helpful and i appreciate the time they took to warn me, a lot.

long story short, I met my sister's boyfriend when i was about 10-11. hes probably 30 right now and my sister is turning 30 soon. he has been touching me inappropriately for a long time now and it was until recently that i figured out this was wrong. he seemed like such a cool and nice guy to whom i could talk about videogames and tv shows with.

will this leave a permanent mark on me? i don't want to develop ptsd, i want to live a normal life. a few years ago when i started researching more about mental health and i came across ptsd it seemed like such a serious thing to me, which i guess it is, but i never thought id get to the point of thinking im at risk. i understand you guys can't diagnose me and im ok with that. i just want to compare my experiences to someone who has gone through the same things.

somehow this is all my fault. i did this to myself. i think it was like 2 years ago when i told him the tv in my living room had some porn channels in it. he didn't believe me so he started searching for them until he found one. we ended up watching porn together, another time i woke up before him and saw him stroking himself (he probably thought i was asleep), today he asked me if id wear lingerie after touching me on my thighs, waist and resting his head on my shoulder while playing a sexual hentai videogame. i can't help but think im the cause of this. im a teen, sexual thoughts do cross my mind but for some reason i think im the one who kickstarted the situation im in for even daring to think about anything sexual. ive never been so ashamed of myself.

can i live a normal life after this? i feel like im overreacting to this even though ive been told my reaction is perfectly normal. i wish i could forget all of this. i don't even feel like a normal person anymore, everything feels like a bad dream that im going to wake up from any minute now, the world doesn't even look real."

I'm 16, 17 in December.

and I have PTSD

I was diagnosed last year, and honest to god, I didn't process any of it. A few months earlier than my PTSD diagnosis, I was diagnosed with GAD, and the two seem a world apart.

I just need to get this off my chest.

As the second anniversary of the goddamn event that screwed my brain over approaches quickly, I've been falling into trap after trap with my PTSD. My triggers are the smallest, dumbest, most random ass things that no one would think are triggers. The most inconspicuous things just sets me straight into a panic attack. I try and smile through them but I'm struggling. I hate that these are my triggers. I don't dislike any of them, I want to normalize them, but I can't do that when I feel like I'm going to pass out every time I encounter them.

I recently experienced sleep paralysis for the first time. And I didn't see some ungodly demon standing in the corner of my room or an old hag sitting on me, quite frankly I'd rather see them. I couldn't open my eyes, I was just paralysed, every inch of my body felt like lead, and all I felt was the sensations of the event and the sheer horror that ran through me as I refused to even attempt to open my eyes in fear that I'd come face to face with it.

I'm losing sleep. I see movement out of the corner of my eyes and dark shadows in places where no one else sees them. I can't focus, my anxiety is wearing me down and my brain just slowly works its way back to what happened every time I try to shove it to the farthest reaches of my subconscious.

Its frustrating that I can't find stories or accounts of others around my age experiencing the same things. Teenage PTSD is so stigmatized its actually dangerous. Apart from the occasional 'coming out of foster care' story, I don't find things I can relate to. I guess it makes sense. Teenaged girls don't have PTSD, it just doesn't happen, but I'm living proof that it does, and it feels to me like I'm alone in that. I haven't been in foster care or an orphanage, I haven't been in a war, my event seems inconsequential in the face of all that. I feel alone. I can't find others like me. Its wearing me down, and I'm afraid. I'm afraid I'll have to live my life knowing that."	[]	"[{'start': 1797, 'end': 1826, 'span': "" 'coming out of foster care' "", 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

5e8c9ac0d541a403f8e68e45	2047_ptsd	"Need help So about two years ago I had a manic episode and was restricted to an psychiatric hold for 42 days. It’s been a rough two years since filled with antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs and I’m looking towards psychotherapy and any advice for help. My ultimate goal is to return to my life medication free. I am scheduled to meet with a psychotherapist this Thursday, so letting everyone know that I’m taking the next steps to better myself already.I will get into my symptoms down below but wanted to start out with a bit of background

I had my intital outburst in a scientific laboratory. I was working really hard towards my masters degree and studying for my mcat when I lost my shit basically. I wasn’t honest with my advisor about how much I thought the work was pushing me to my limits and wasn’t taking my mental health as a priority. I became paranoid believing my colleagues and friends were out to get me. I stayed up for three days without sleep and I had an extreme accident when could have blinded me with scientific materials from the lab. From my stay in the psychiatric hold, my family visited me but they held me for so long because I couldn't come to about all my paranoid thoughts. Eventually, they did die down with the medication and I never saw any hallucinations or voices. I was diagnosed with Bipolar.

Since then, I am quite functional in everyday life. I don't get out of the house much and my social life is lame, and I also don't have a girlfriend. I have a job now but I do still have a few symptoms that I wish would be relieved. I am easily reminded of people from my old work setting and I think things have hidden meanings sometimes. At my worst, I actually thought I was communicating telepathically with a secret society because they wanted my intellectual value in their recruitment. I'll have ideas of reference where I believe people in public are specifically talking about something associated with me.

I think a lot of my issue is that I’m critical of people and critical of myself. I know that it could be underneath all this that I have low self esteeem and maybe that I even didn’t have enough confidence in myself to do the work that I was doing before my accident.

Am I even more out there to think that this sort of paranoia will sustain ever? I've been medicated which makes me think this is not a biological problem but rather a psychological one. I believe that with the right help and my own willpower that I can overcome my past and lead the life I want to live. I feel like if I were to socialize more and even get a girlfriend that my life would be better and less stressful.

Also, what should I expect from the psychotherapist? Will it be one of the therapist who believe medicine is the answer or one like some of my previous therapists that think I can overcome this without medication. I wanted to try psychotherapy mainly because of Jordan B Peterson and is youtube videos I've watched. Plus, I didn't feel that much of a connection and want to be picky if I'm paying to talk to somebody."

5e8c9ac0d541a403f8e68e45	1573_ptsd	"TW: violence/sexual abuse. Is it possible that my anxiety is ptsd related? I (24/f) grew up in a favela and had some life events happen to me Why I want insight: from the age 15-18 I tried to self-diagnose a bunch but then by 18 I felt like it was just a regular “growing up and figuring it out” phase. The one label I have identified with since then is the good ol’ “anxiety”. Everyone has it. So in a sense I have felt “normal”. I have worked through a bunch of things that I attributed to how my parents raised me and I would honestly say that I am a generally happy, positive person.

Now, here is what got me started on thinking about this: A few days ago I did coke for the first time ever (I’m not a druggie. All I have done is the somewhat regular weed and occasional alcohol). No big deal. I didn’t trip out or enjoy it. I simply felt nothing from it. I snorted my last dose of it close to 10PM. At around 3AM I tried to sleep. I was at a cheap motel and in the room next us there were some people having a party and talking a little too loud, walking in and out of the room. Sometimes it sounded like they would be walking into my room — a thought which I could easily dismiss but a feeling that I couldn’t shake. I was on full-on alert. I felt as if I was going to be “disturbed”, that something or someone would be making me get up and I was scared. The more I thought of it, the less what I felt seemed cocaine-related, and the more I could think about other times I felt the same way.

So, here is my background:
I am from a neigbourhood called Piedade, in Rio de Janeiro. Born and raised there until I was 8/9 years old. I moved with my family around Brazil until I was 15, at which point we moved to Canada. 
Rio is a dangerous (!!!), violent place. My neighbourhood was a favela. Not the worst one but a favela nevertheless. I can recall most nights falling asleep to the sounds of gunshots. I can’t really recall the sound of gunshots nowadays until I hear one. I have been caught up in the line of fire quite a few times. Most of them were on the streets and we would just stay put in corners of the house. Some of them were while I was out on the streets and had to just scoot down in the car or run and hide inside nearby stores. One of my earliest memories is of me being woken up in a hurry by my parents. They just grabbed me and my brother and took us to the bathroom. Our doors and windows were gridded and someone — or in my memory as a child, something scary — was banging on them. I honestly don’t remember much of that anymore. Just the paralyzing fear, attentiveness, confusion. What happened was that someone was getting followed by a gang to be killed. We had a big yard and this guy jumped into our property. My parents, who were outside, heard neighbours yelling to warn them and they ran inside to get us. The gang arrived, our neighbor was an ex cop, and a shootout happened all around us. But like I said, it’s mostly a feeling to me.
We left Rio when I was 8/9 and I witnessed a lot less of that type of violence. I continued to witness robberies and assaults. A lot of noisy situations. Looking back at it, robbers tend to make their presences known when they are trying to intimidate people with noise.
Anyway, that was until I was 15 and we left to come to Canada.
15 was also just about the age when my dad stopped hitting me. He had some anger bursts for no good reason.
In a few instances in Brazil, and once in Canada, I was groped very indiscreetly.
Then in Canada, once I was 18/19 I was living alone in a basement. I got out of my shower, heard some loud bangs on my door. I froze. Some people burst through, looked at me, ran away. I was shocked but still managed to call the cops right away. I just couldn’t think properly enough to explain it to them in as much detail as they wanted.

So here I am today. I have recurring nightmares quite often. I would say I could go a week having nightmares only. Someone usually dies in my dreams. Most times I am killed in it, other times I am the one killing. Occasionally, in these dreams, someone else will die in front of me. In real life when I hear loud noises my mind freezes. If someone is talking to me after a noisy disturbance I can “go with it” but about 30 seconds to a few minutes later I have to ask them to rewind because I wasn’t “there” anymore. I have really, really, really light sleep. I feel tired all the time. I don’t like spending nights alone at home. Sometimes not even days. If I do, I keep checking on doors, windows and peep behind curtains. If I’m alone I barely sleep or sleep super late until it’s light out. I don’t feel comfortable in loud places (unless there’s rythm/music).

Anyway, like I said in the beginning, I am still a generally happy person. My anxiety, other than what I just described above, is not a big part of my life anymore. But also, what I call anxiety I have usually attributed to that “worrying” feeling that I will fail or something will go wrong because of me and my decisions (money, school). So, I guess I am wondering if what I described is something like ptsd or if I am just being dramatic and trying to label myself again. But also, part of me feels as if I have made huge progress with my anxiety and that it shed a light into something hidden deeper — I have made peace with the things I used to blame for my anxiety, yet some feelings of uneasiness linger on. I was wondering if I could have ptsd to any extent (none or mild to moderate maybe?). 

Please tell me what you think. Personal experiences relating to it and even not relating to it would be appreciated. I’m obviously not going to use your opinions as diagnosis but it would help to have a frame of reference.

I have some weird tics that seem to come on strong for weeks at s time, then go away, then come back. I know they’re anxiety related, but it seems neurological too.

I have a few old surgery scars, and the other day I just became hyper aware of them, as if they were a seam on my clothing!

Even my speech patterns change when I’m put on the spot. Sometimes I’ll try to say two words at once or begin stuttering if I feel self conscious. ALL of these tics are new as of the last few years (I’m a 27 year old woman, these all seemed to come with the PTSD).

I can list other weird sensitivities too, but those are the biggest ones. I have major decision anxiety and the last few days I’ve been fairly isolated and doing a lot of budgeting and planning.

&amp;#x200B;

Today it is 15 years since the event my family called The Incident. When I was 16, we went through a home-invasion in the middle of the night, in which I and my parents were shot. My parents and brother were also beaten. Though we all survived (by mere heartbeats, and with some permanent injuries), the level of violence and disregard for human life we experienced is grotesque.

&amp;#x200B;

We live in South Africa. Today, I board with my parents because they need the financial support, and because I frankly don't think it is safe to leave them alone in the old house. Yes, we still live in the same place. This time of the year is always the worst. July (midwinter here) gets freezing cold, just like that night I spent lying on the concrete in a pool of my own frigid blood, convinced that I was dying. We cannot go to bed until at least after midnight. We listen for the slightest sounds and stare out of the windows at shadows in the blackness.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents are well into their 70s, and my father was disabled by the attack. They are struggling to live on a puny pension  (equivalent to about $70 a month) and my rent. I cannot get them to a safer place. I feel trapped here, playing the one younger stronger man in the household whose presence can hopefully deter an attack.

&amp;#x200B;

The usual July crime-wave is sweeping our area again. Yesterday a next-door-neighbour's house was broken into and ransacked. There is a small minority of people in this country who want White people dead. A month ago a young couple was shot to death in cold blood in a racist attack a couple of blocks away from me when their car ran out of fuel. They were executed, and the car was torched. These incidents constantly remind us of the hatred we tasted on that night. My nightmares of being shot are increasing in frequency, and last night I dreamt a man was slicing into my chest from all angles with a knife, in exactly the place where I was operated on after being shot. It seems at any moment it could all happen again."

(Was not on campus at the time)

Starting a few days ago, a spotlight was put on my college’s truly terrible handling of sexual assaults on campus, and people are very rightfully upset, because the school seriously and repeatedly fucked up, to the point where they could face legal repercussions. The thing is, the students here are very vocal about and frequently fairly united on their opinions on issues like this. So now I’ve been getting about five emails every day about ‘addressing campus sexual assault’ or whatever (my tone is dismissive because administration is just trying to minimize the problem without actually trying to solve it) and starting today, there’s a massive sit in in our union building, there are local news crews here to cover it, and there must be thousands of fliers everywhere on campus. It has been months since I was as triggered as I was today. I have had multiple panic attacks, flashbacks, and auditory hallucinations. I feel like I can’t even breathe when I’m not locked away in my room, but even there, I’m starting to feel like a caged animal. I don’t think the organizers of the sit in (the sit in is the reason for all the other things listed) realize how damaging this is to the very population they’re trying to champion, and I don’t know how to fix it enough that I feel okay in my own skin on campus again."

About 4 months ago, I moved to a city environment. The constant stream of stimuli (noise, light, etc) has been very difficult to get used to. I struggle with the normal sounds of cars passing by on the busy road we live on, so as you can imagine, actually creepy things have a HUGE affect on me. It's about 2am as I'm writing this and there's a man pacing around my apartment building, knocking on doors and windows, and it's EXTREMELY triggering, and has induced a lot of paranoia.

I'm not alone (my boyfriend is here) and my doors and windows are locked, as well as the lights off (save for a few lamps that we keep on all of the time). However, the apartment is on the ground floor which gives me anxiety, and I have doubts about the strength of one of the bedroom windows.

5d1e57ed1e5829001bce88eb	2372_ptsd	"Sudden realization has shook me as a person (note: I know diagnosis posts are not allowed. I am not requesting that. I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent/ramble/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)

I had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. 

I've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. 

Nope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. 

And then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then ""wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?"" 

And then the floodgates started to open. 

*  ""Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable""      
* ""Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.""      
* ""I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me. All two of the physical fights I have been in, have been with him when he was in the house and I snapped after he wouldn't leave despite me begging mom to have him leave""      
* ""What are the other symptoms of ptsd? (googles) ... disturbed sleep? ..."" (i am a violent sleeper. i dont put sheets on anymore as they 100% always are ripped off as i thrash in my sleep""     
* ""and... shouting in your sleep? ......"" (no conscious memory, but apparently every night i shout out things. my mom doesnt mention it much anymore unless it was a bad night, but whenever i share a hotel with someone I wake up to ""why were you shouting ""stop go away stop"" at 3 AM?"")           
* ""what else cou- nightmares too?"" (never related to trauma in a way i can discern, but have nightmares that wake me up screaming in about 1/3 sleeps)             
* ""exaggerated startle response? Does that mean what I think? ... Yes. ... fuck..."" (its not quite as severe anymore but i used to invariably freak out if someone touched me without me seeing it. My dad(never hit me, never abused me, was the chill parent) used to poke me in the car at random, just jokingly. I would flinch and recoil every time. Eventually I got to a point where I would sit pushed against the passenger side door to try and get away from it. He asked me at the time why I flinched and got scared, he never hit me. I didnt know why I did that but I couldnt stop. Now I dont do well with people touching me at random, surprising noises, loud bangs, sirens and fire alarms)   

It was like I was looking at a connect the dots, and the dots were all in a straight line in numerical order. I got deeply confused. Why hadn't I ever talked to my psychiatrists about this? Why didn't I realize I have flashbacks weekly or more? Why didn't I realize hearing aggressive shouting is very prone to do this, even from strangers in public, or in film/tv? Why didn't I realize my reaction to the memory or presence of my moms abuser far exceeds what is normal? Why did I not connect my hatred of his face, Heineken, the smell of spilled beer, or his cologne with this? How did I never admit this? Any of this? Why did I always deny I had trauma issues or dodge the question so deftly, all the while completely unconscious of what I was dodging? What the fuck do I do now? 

I feel like I wasn't hurt badly enough. I wasn't the direct target of any of his violence until I was an adult. It wasn't sexual or combat related. It didn't ruin my life(depression did that for me) like my friend, who I knew disassociates for hours and wakes up multiple times nightly from the nightmares. I feel guilty for even considering it, but I detect too many characteristics that line up for me to ignore it. I'm making an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I've been seeing psychiatrists for 9 years by now and I've never done this. 

My sense of self and my understanding of my mental health has been destroyed. I feel like I was assembling a jigsaw puzzle of myself, was mostly done, and perhaps 40% of the puzzle just got torn off, mixed up, and the pieces thrown across the floor. I've always felt that if nothing else, I knew what happens to my brain. I thought it has been the same for years now. That there wasn't more to discover, just need to work more therapy and cope better. But there's been a giant red neon sign saying ""THESE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS YOU DOLT"" here the whole time and I've been blind to it. What else could I have missed? How deep does this trauma stuff run? How am I supposed to self evaluate when I can apparently never be objective about these things? What use is talking about ones symptoms if I managed to perfectly lie to myself and to my doctors and therapists for all of these years?

It's so plainly obvious, I think I must have subconsciously been refusing to accept it. To protect.. something. That's why I think I was able to take off the blinders about this when I was uninhibited through the drugs I took to calm down. Its my only thought I've managed to come up with regarding why I never saw the plainly obvious truth, and instead unconsciously denied and avoided, with expert skill, connecting the symptoms to trauma. Even the flashbacks. I always just thought I was being dramatic and emotional. I never had a thought about them beyond ""oh just ignore it"". Even though I knew what PTSD commonly presents as. Even though I didn't think I was hiding anything or that I would hide anything like this. 

I'm talking to my psychiatrist soon. I don't look forward to it at all. I have a feeling it will be awful trying to say any of this. I don't even know what's next. I am not able to reduce my exposure to my triggers. I can't control him. My mom thinks I should like him and has never understood how upset I get. Even when I (of all people, never hurt a fly, never wanted to fight anyone, ever) have been so upset by his presence, combined with hearing his inescapable voice in my bedroom, that I attacked him. Two different times. I can't even type this post without crying from this. Talking. Ugh. :(

Sorry for this huge wall of text. I'm just. My brain feels like scrambled eggs. So many questions. Feel so lost about who/what I am as a person and what my mental illness means and how they affect me. It's seemingly all gone out the window and I'm put back at the start. Need to start working on writing stuff down for my appointment so I can't conveniently forget to mention it.

A list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.

Extreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn’t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.


Fainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I’m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children’s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)


Insomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn’t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn’t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven’t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. 


Vivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it’s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. 


Social Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)


Heart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn’t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)


Depression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn’t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I’m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn’t make me sad or upset, it’s not like I wanted those things because I don’t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn’t close to my dad but wasn’t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn’t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn’t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)


Irregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I’m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight/flight/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)


Concentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) 


A few other things I experienced but I don’t feel like going into:
Eating disorders
Alcohol and drug abuse 
Promiscuity 


All of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I’m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. 


Just now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns."

My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again.  During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with.  But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child. 
   The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her.  He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away).  He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too.  He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since.  Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can’t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual.  Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time.  He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything.  He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time.  He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him.  He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.

i still deal with PTSD like symptoms such as strong twitching when thinking about my past or very sad subjects. im especially sensitive to things like that. if im at work im distant from others and if left with time to wander in my thoughts, i will think about dark stuff and flinch very noticeably - and others might ask why i do that. it's embarrassing but at other times i feel completely okay, even happy, can function for days no problem. i even have the habit a bit contradictory to the sad thought flinch - just thinking of little jokes and i'll laugh out loud - and of course that's embarrassing to as i seem like a crazy person to my co-workers. i guess i have a strong pendulum of emotion and react strongly to it. other times its long bouts of apathy. 


so im thinking about getting therapy / help again. but even looking around on websites and thinking about getting that help upsets me. i flinch pretty hard but not even on certain hard memories, just vague memories of the multiple occasions when i had a bad time in my past. i think PTSD, if i really do have it, probably blurred my memory on certain bad things. i also can't find any good info on this stuff. i don't know if i should get therapy or not either - money is a problem for me and therapy brings out the worst emotions. i don't want to feel those bad emotions, its very painful.

5d1e57ed1e5829001bce88eb	2097_ptsd	"Survivors of Murder-Suicide Hi all,

On Jan. 30, 2018 I became a survivor of murder-suicide.

Facts were written in the media, case files, autopsy reports and death certificates. They were illustrated with crime scene photos and national news headlines.

Breadcrumbs of truth built the narrative for me, never telling the full story.

There are 11 murder-suicides each week in the United States, often in military and veteran communities. Why aren’t we talking about this publicly beyond sensationalized headlines that don’t help solve the problem?

The lack of support, information, and humanization led me to believe nobody *should* be talking about it. I felt voiceless and carried significant guilt and shame because of the stigmatized circumstances.

I’m taking back the narrative. As a survivor of murder-suicide, I am more than a murderer’s daughter.

My writing will add to the national conversation on mental health and veteran post-traumatic stress disorder. I hope my story will educate the public and help survivors of this type of tragedy to know they are not alone; the shame is not theirs to carry as they navigate their complex journey.

If you are a survivor of murder-suicide, or know somebody who is looking for support, please consider following my blog here: [www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com](https://www.brittanynoblemccarthy.com). I am connecting with researchers and fellow survivors to reduce the stigma on this awful experience, and help other survivors. I am committed to taking my experience and turning it into a force for good to help others.

Thanks for your time."	[]	[{'start': 56, 'end': 96, 'span': 'I became a survivor of murder-suicide.\r\n', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts.    Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didn’t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan.    After that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he wasn’t apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone.

Reading that scared the living hell out of me. I thought there was no way I could improve with a damaged brain. But today I learned that is just not the case. The brain is moldable. The brain is trainable. I don't know if I can gain back the actual brain mass? But regardless, I have been assured by my doctor that it won't impact my ability to recover.

I am inherently a very loud, extroverted person, but I just can't seem to vent about certain things. No matter how hard I try. Like I know what the vent would be about. I'm hypersexual, and I have issues with my gender and my religion. But the sections where I write out, even in a private journal where no one can see, feel such an immense panic that I just can't get it out onto paper.

I get that this is common, and most people can just suck it up and move on, but because I'm such a loud person, I've established a status quo with people that I will come to them when I'm upset. That's why when these things cross my mind and start throttling me, I want to be able to go to them and talk about it, but I get overwhelmed with such a large amount of panic that I just can't function. I feel like I'm denying them, or that I should tell them.

But it's not like I can just go on hiding it forever. It's a persistently invasive part of my life that has consistently made me very upset on a number of occasions but what am I supposed to do? Vent? (haha) So it's like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. There's nowhere for me to go, and I'm not currently in a place where I have access to therapy.

recently i've started watching Harlots on hulu, and in it there are several scenes where a character is either sexually assaulted or raped. i have no memory of either of these things happening to me, but for some reason when i saw them it immediately set off a panic attack and had me crying inconsolably. this has only happened a handful of other times before when a friend showed me a graphic novelization of a story shared by several comfort women from WWII, and when i wasn't fast enough to fast forward through the opening scene of an L&amp;O: SVU episode. i've never had this reaction when someone on either of these shows mentions an act of assault or describes it, it was only the graphic depiction of it. the only other thing i can really latch onto is that, when i read about someone being assaulted on the news or through social media topics, i get a very weird feeling down there. it's not pain, just a reflex, but it absolutely isn't enjoyable. it starts off this very heavy feeling in my stomach that sticks with me for hours, and i feel very detached from everything afterward.

is it possible that something has happened to me and i've just blocked it out so heavily that i can't even go back to a moment in time that would hint to me why i'd be reacting this way? i was predated on in the past, through chatrooms in an online game i used to play, but i never met anyone i talked to and therefore had no physical contact with them. i'm afraid to ask my family, because someone will immediately say i've made it up and that nothing bad has ever happened to me. i just want some kind of answer, and if anyone could help me i'd really appreciate it. thank you."

It hurt everywhere. I wanted to close my eyes but. My brother.. my brother. I think he is hurt. I look at the other side of the street and my father seems half dead. No, no.. no. Papa, are you okay? Papa.. Help, help. My father. Help, help.. he might faint. Help, I can't get my father out. Take the gun, he says. Take the gun. Call someone. Call someone. My arms and knees are weak. I carry my brother, see? His arms are wrapped around my neck.. his legs around my waist.  Help, help. The smoke, the smoke.. hurry. 

Time stopped there too. Time stopped there too. 

I shouted as the ride took a second turn. And then a third.

I got into a really bad accident about 9 years ago, and after nearly causing another accident a few days later after swerving when I saw an oncoming car I gave up driving. For about 2 years I could hardly get into a car without panicing. However, 9 years later, I have no problem getting into a car however I cannot fathom driving. Bad drivers still give me scares, but thats normal I'm sure. Most of my anxiety now comes from lack of self-confidence in driving, and imagining things like people running stop signs (someone ran a stop sign and hit me going 50 over the speed limit) at intersections. The inability to drive has deeply impacted my life and I would really like to get over the overwhelming anxiety that has limited me, so any advice or suggestions are welcome. For what its worth, anxiety has impacted me greatly in other aspects of life but this specific problem is rooted in a tramautic event.

I'm not sure whether talking with her on the phone or through some videoconferencing application (such as Skype) would be something you could do in the meantime until you sort out what you want to do.Some things I wonder are:What makes the two of them not get along?What makes him feel threatened or on edge if you visit your mother without him? What does he think will happen?What is he getting out of trying to choose for you?What is he so afraid of?If you decide to talk about these things with your boyfriend, try to do the following:Consider using questions that start with the words who, what, where, when, and not why. The word why can be really difficult for some people to answer because the word itself triggers an emotional reaction.Try to ask him if the two of you can discuss this in a way that you can just ask more questions about what he is experiencing. If you can listen without being defensive about what you think and feel, you may understand more about where you boyfriend is coming from.Remember that understanding what he means does not mean that you have to agree with what he is saying.Maybe he would be willing to listen to what you are experiencing and ask questions about that as you did for him. It would be good to do this in a way similar to what an investigative reporter would do and asking questions that cannot be answered in a yes or no format and require more information.I'm sure this is putting you in a very tough place.

5ebd275ec42d33061709cf86	1469_ptsd	"Suffering Suffering, Losing My Twin Brother TLDR: Fill your well of sorrow with natural, wholesome joys.

This story is tragic, and I’m omitting personal details for a lot of reasons, but my experience is, in sharing my story, that others have found solace. Last summer, after a family event/argument led to domestic violence at home, I decided to move out of the house, where I was living with my twin brother. He had suffered from depression for most of his life, but towards the end, he became increasingly violent and manic. I was scared, and confused, and did what I thought was best for me and my partner at the time, and moved down the street to a new apt. The next day, after working, and not hearing from him, I started to get a sick feeling in my stomach. I ignored it for a few hours, drinking water and laying down, but the sick feeling grew into something else that I can’t describe. I’m sure you’ve heard stories of twins sensing each other, especially in times of distress. It’s rare, but I’m telling you, that shit is very real. So I walked over to our house, and he didn’t answer the door. It was a Tuesday night. He was 32. We were 32.

My actual experience is something too horrible and sad to describe in detail, but I did find him, and I’m the one who went in, and raised him up, and took him off of that rope. That tangible, physical experience, mixed with the tragedy of losing my twin brother, my best friend, who I spent my entire childhood with, has left me deeply traumatized. There’s an element to it that took part of my identity itself, as a twin, I’m now now longer part of a set. I’m half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How do I continue to be a twin without my match? Is a set still a set, once you apply subtraction? Am I still a twin now that he is gone?

My trauma experience is a nightmare, literally. My dreams manifest things I don’t even want to go into, and I’ve never been so aware of how many times suicide is mentioned in films, television, even comedy. It’s everywhere, and the suicide rates among young people are at unprecedented levels. My triggers induce a deep breath in me, at the mention of the word, or image, or a roped off front yard, Dad attempting to make the grass grow. Or a bread tie. Or a dog collar. It’s weird how things manifest like that. Unfortunately the mystery leaves me vulnerable to crying episodes in public, or leaving social gatherings early, and unannounced. I attempted to continue to suck it up, and be social, but my loss made me nervous, confused, empty. It left me empty. But, like the dry chalice might be considered to be empty, perhaps the purpose of the chalice, is to be filled. And so it flows into me...

It taught me to see truth a little clearer, but this has been hard. Truth requires self reflection first, self truth, whatever that means to you. I had to look hard at myself in order to deal with my grief and my guilt, and I know I’ll struggle to understand these issues for the rest of my life. I’ve been writing and reading about suicide, bipolar disorder (which he had), consciousness, empathy, truth, friendships, spirituality, and sorrow to try to process all of this. 

I never could have imagined being in this place, on this island. At first, many were supportive, but slowly I became more and more isolated, feeling like no one possibly could understand what I was going through. I slowly lost most of the people in my life, not because they didn’t care, but because they didn’t have the capacity to show it, they just didn’t know how. Who could blame them? I was confrontational, angry, sad, confused, and hoping someone was going to make it better for me. But it wasn’t about anyone else, if I was going to ever feel good again, it was going to be ME who made that happen. It’s amazing how everything can turn on a dime, and never return. It’s like, when he died, he took this..  thing... from me. What it is, I can’t name, but it’s gone for sure, and I’m pretty sure it’s not coming back. So what do I do with it, this emptiness? I walk with it. Literally. I walk and walk the trails on this island all day. It’s winter now, so it’s much colder, and my walks are filled with less pauses, but I persist. 

I’m in therapy, sometimes several times a week. I do not consume alcohol or hard drugs. I use particular psychedelics with a therapeutic intent, and have experienced profound revelations that have been helpful in moving my mind in a more conscious and positive direction. I take natural herbal supplements for energy and mood balancing, but I find that exercising in a natural environment is the best thing for me therapeutically. I’m lucky to be young enough to be so mobile. 

I’ve slowly shed all social media, FB, IG, etc, because I found it to contribute to my anxiety, my isolation, and resentment. I was constantly trying to openly share, self examine, and had hopes that others would reciprocate. But people don’t really want to do that. It’s super uncomfortable, and most would rather be distracted by the game, or their phone, or a drink. Finally, after a point in which I felt like what I was saying fell on deaf ears, I decided to no longer share with those who couldn’t hear it anymore. My therapist brought to mind the biblical concept “cast ye your pearls before swine”.  Of course I’m not saying my words are gospel, and in fact, I offer no advice to anyone, this is all purely my experience and expression. 

In fact, I’m in distress a lot, and I’m not saying that any of this made me a “better person”, I’m saying it made me wake the fuck up to myself, and what I was doing. Things don’t get easier, they just get different. Tragedy sometime can birth strength, but often times, tragic events do not make people better, stronger, or more aware, in fact it often makes us more disconnected, more isolated, feeling like we’re unique, and our pain is unique. Victims of trauma can’t be put into order in a filing cabinet, there’s no sense to be made of it. Some are resentful of those thriving, saying “that’s not my experience”. Of course it isn’t. It’s just yours. And this is just mine. And although my situation and personality are unique, I find my pain isn’t. The whole world is suffering suffering. My pain might just disappear, like a drop becomes the ocean, in the great vastness of collective consciousness, if I can release myself of the burden through empathy. Might any of us be strong enough to let the ocean completely envelop us? 

So it’s been a few weeks now since I’ve been free from Instagram and Facebook, and my urge to check a screen, my addiction to check in on these carefully manicured presentations of digital life, has faded. Leaving me again, more room to be filled with the good things I enjoy in life. Playing my guitar, and reading Melville in the bathtub, meditating outside, walking the sandy trails with the rabbits, listening to my favorite records, and most importantly, spending time with my loving and compassionate partner, who is the most selfless, understanding soul in my whole world. Without love, I would have perished along with my brother, but it’s love that kept me alive, and keeps me going. If I can learn to love myself truly, I know I’ll survive. 

I hope to someday find a way to have a PTSD service dog, although it seems unlikely, due to the cost of training one properly (about $20K). I absolutely love dogs, and I think about adopting one frequently, but again, it’s so hard for me to initiate important things, I can’t even imagine starting this process. A good friend of mine has a couple hounds who love me, and make me super happy, so sometimes, when I’m really down, I just go lay on the floor over at his house, and let the dogs go to town licking me and climbing all over me. It’s so sensational and wonderful, I smile just writing about it. A pure, simple, wholesome joy. 

I’m not past the pain, I’m just finding out better ways in which to navigate it. Some days, the seas are choppy, but at least the sails are full. The shores of the seas of my mental landscape, are lined by a great, “mental forest”. My twin brother was a great tree in my forest, and hard he fell, but that break in the canopy has given my forest new growth. Exotic species sprout from the sunlit patch spontaneously, and they invite me in, and we become one, and I enjoy the sun with them while I can. 

Are you in pain? I already love you."

I've been working hard in trying to get better (which I recognise isn't the most helpful phrase, I should be working to live with myself), so I've been running 3 times a week, trying to eat properly (I have a poor relationship with food and body image, so when stressed I just do **not** eat), getting up in the morning (I like the mornings), and I've been doing art therapy.

Because I'm fucking terrified of reaching out for help. I'm scared of a bad reaction **every single time.** I've convinced myself a lot lately that my SO doesn't love me, that my best friend finds me annoying, or that my family thinks I am a failure. I can honestly say that **none of this is true.** My SO and best friends are worried sick about me, same with my family. They don't think I'm failing, and the only thing I know they're all struggling with is that they don't know **how** to help, and damn it all I don't have that answer for them either. I **wish**, fucking WISH, I could give them something, ANYTHING, to work with, because ffs then **I'd** have something to work with too.

Because I'm apologising and thanking people for every basic thing they do, I'm convinced one fuck up and that's it, they'll hate me forever now.

Because despite my usually extremely useful grounding procedures, I'm still feeling the pain in my body and I still shake. I'm fed up of feeling that the people I love will suddenly turn hostile, and I'm also scared of them suddenly dying.

When I got back from inpatient, I wanted to talk to the HR lady to see where I stand with my job. Considering I didn't have a choice in my hospitalization, I thought it would be fine. Well, it wasn't fine. She didn't even talk to me in private, she just fired me in the lobby in front of people. It triggered me so hard, I just gave up on trying.

Plus I'm CS (customer support) so every 15 minutes I have to brew coffee and make customer connections (talk and interact with them). IT IS KILLING ME. I'm so awkward, and I can't seem to get a grip on anything. It's a continuous cycle of me not being able to focus, so it stresses me out, which makes me dissociate, which makes me try to focus even harder. So on and so forth. 

My coworkers are very supportive of me, but I don't think most of them understand what PTSD is. I always get a uncomfortable vibe once I tell someone about my diagnosis. It was super uncomfortable my first day because another guy who started the same day as me (who btw, I met at partial of all places) ASKED ME IN FRONT OF MY MANAGER WHAT MY DIAGNOSES WERE. I felt like I was outed. It makes me cringe when I think of that moment. I'm trying to be positive, but it's really hard to at the moment."

Almost nobody around me that's been in less than 6 years has seen anything remotely close to combat, and neither have I. While on a peace time ""deployment"" there was an incident where a few people were drowning, and I stayed back to call the coast guard while my friends went out to help them. One friend ended up being out in 4-8 foot surf with rip tides and sharp coral for an hour and a half, almost 2 hours. I was giving the military police a live update of the situation over the phone and trying to coordinate rescue with the Japanese coast guard. At one point I lost sight of 2 people and thought they had died because I was going too slow. They ended up surviving, one with permanent damage to a few organs. I have these terrible nightmares multiple times a week where if I mess something up, myself or someone else dies. I wake up with really hard reflexes, like a huge jump or a swing, in a cold sweat. I feel super inadequate though. The people around me who have trauma have it from combat, and I have it from being on the phone. I didn't even swim out there. I know it would have been worse if the coast guard hadn't come and everything but I feel guilty about it every single day. This was months ago, and I don't go a single day without feeling guilty either because I didn't go fast enough or because I didn't go out to help. Does anyone know any resources, especially free military specific ones that could help me out? I have to talk to my chaplain still. It's embarrassing to me to get help for it though.

flash forwards to the next year. summer. starting highschool. we moved in with my aunt. my cousin, who's about a year younger or two younger than me tended to get his siblings to help him pin me down and he'd waterboard me everyday for weeks. i tried telling my parents about it, and all they told me was that i was a highschooler and i needed to get over it. i was a straight A student but i only got to the end of freshman year before breaking down. at the end of my sophmore year i dropped out. planned to kill myself, but it didn't work. tried to go back to school, but that didn't work either as i was unmedicated. 

and now, i've been having nightmares. i don't know if they're repressed memories or not, but it's only of someone kissing my neck and me feeling disgusted and i've been falling apart. i feel so disgusting aand i don't know what to do anymore but just curl up and mourn over everything that i've gone through because they. ruined everything. i isolated myself for years from my family, i lost my best friend, my future. i was gonna get a scholorship but fuck that i'm just an asshole who sits around all day moping about shit thats happened in the past and i hate it i hate myself"	[]	[{'start': 152, 'end': 243, 'span': 'being neglected throughout my childhood, being physically and mentally abused by my mother.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1238, 'end': 1260, 'span': 'planned to kill myself', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1470, 'end': 1518, 'span': 'someone kissing my neck and me feeling disgusted', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

It's getting worse and I can't sleep--I barricade my doors at night, I stay up really late listening for any sounds/trying to find out what made the sound, if I hear a noise that startles me it's like a punch in the stomach, all my energy drains, my stomach is in knots, I check and check and check my whole house looking for people who might be hiding and (if I sleep) I sleep with a loaded snub-nose .357 magnum, sometimes in my hand. If I dream, they are stress dreams at best or night terrors. Some times the stress causes me to vomit uncontrollably for hours on end. I wake up crying/screaming. I don't want to live like this. Does anyone else who has this level of ptsd (I don't even know if this is severe or not) have any suggestions for quick relief, even if temporary?

I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that ""traditional college experience."" Truth is, I really hate it. I was diagnosed with PTSD at the end of 2018, alongside depression and anxiety. My trauma happened in February of 2018, so it is pretty fresh and still hurts. It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. 

My other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the ""Traditional college experience"" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week. It might be a long shot that anyone has experience with this. Regardless, can anyone give me some help/advice/reassurance? I'm not sure what to do.

666208dc57b332c5dbcaac25	1567_counseling	It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern.  You seem to have some good insight into the situation.The type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers, childhood trauma and/or abuse or neglect, or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self.  This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy.  I recommend a book titled “Boundaries: Where you end and I begin” by Anne Katherine.  Another book that might be helpful is “Codependent No More” by Melody Beattie. In the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely do not enter into another relationship.  Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole, happy, emotionally healthy person on your own.  Needing another person to define you is problematic.  That’s too much to expect from any individual.For a relationship to be healthy and happy, both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own.  That means having a clear sense of self, knowing who you are and what you want, knowing how to set healthy boundaries, and knowing how to meet your own needs.  It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time.  There will be times that they won’t be able to meet your needs.  You have to know how to meet those yourself. When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be, eventually the right person will come into your life.  Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to complete you.

666208dc57b332c5dbcaac25	1661_ptsd	Tl;dr best friend told me it’s my fault I have PTSD To make a long story....well, slightly less long. I was groomed as a child by a man who was 9 years older than me. I was 15 when it started. I continued a relationship with him for the next 4 years. When we moved in together he became increasingly abusive and he raped me. After that he started stalking me and harassing me endlessly, so I reported it. All of it. I didn’t want to, I didn’t want to even think about it anymore. But I just wanted him to leave me alone. Since then I’ve had to make my statement 3 different times, and they need me to do it again. I was venting to my best friend about how I didn’t think I could handle doing it again and she told me that the only way I’ll ever be at peace with it is if I just keep reliving it until I get over it, and compared it to when she had to watch her dog die. I told her there was no being at peace with being raped by someone who you loved and she said “well I guess you can just let it torment you forever then”. I’m really hurt to hear this coming from her of all people. I’ve been struggling to find any sort of support from anyone and I’ve been struggling to cope in general. I lock myself in my apartment and I’m too scared to leave. I haven’t left my house in 4 months. I hate that he has so much power over me and I hate that I can’t just “deal with it”, because trust me I want to more than anything. I don’t want to be affected by it anymore.

666208dc57b332c5dbcaac25	2491_ptsd	"ADA Accommodations - Shadiness Hi All! 

I know this might not be the best place to post - but I'm wondering if any of you have had issues when requesting ADA accommodations for your PTSD?

Long story short - I've been with my current employer 5 years; I am in an executive-level position and have had 5 years of great performance reviews; Late 2016 my PTSD ratcheted up after I was flooded with childhood sexual trauma memories; I took FMLA in January 2017 for the full 12 weeks, returned to work part time for two months, then full time since.

In August 2017, my manager decided I needed to meet with her to discuss accommodations for her made-up ""Essential Duties"" of being in-person at a single meeting per month. I clarified with her that attendance at the meeting would be my highest priority and asked for a full roster of needed ADA Accommodations. She agreed with most of my suggestions, we implemented a plan that's been working since. She was asked to follow up with HR on my request that all PTSD-related absences be excluded from the policy (she raised that I was ""getting into trouble"" with the policy and she would have to let me go if I violated it). I never heard back, so didn't worry about it (she has always been very lax with the attendance policy for all in the department).

Flash to February 2018, I have my first high-symptom call-out day (8 hours) in a while (about 3 months). Boss reviews all my absences since my return, and asks for documentation on two from 2017. She says it is because I'm bumping against the company policy for too many absence occurrences in 12 months. She is only looking at PTSD-related events, as the two times I had the flu this year didn't spark any kind of review, nor did non-PTSD absences last year. I ask her about the policy exception we discussed in August, and suddenly she's on the defensive. She responds that there is no exception, and decides she told me about this last year. It didn't happen, so I ask for documentation. She can't find any.

Last Monday, I had a meeting with HR to ""formally"" open my ADA accommodation request. Per the company, this is the first time I'm asking for anything, because my boss never brought my August conversation to HR, nor educated me that there was additional steps to formalize it. I meet with HR, I give them an updated list of accommodations, they give me paperwork for my doctor - no problem.

When I look at the paperwork, the job description isn't mine - it is for a coworker in another department. I send a copy of what I have on file, and ask for confirmation it is correct. A WEEK LATER I am still arguing with my supervisor and HR as they keep insisting I hold a job that I do not (completely different scope than my actual job, as actually described in the JD I have from 2 yeas ago). My job description now needs to go through the full HR review process and be approved.

**TL/DR and Ultimate question:** Are they trying to screw me? The culture at my employer is one of intolerance/purposeful ignorance of PTSD and its impacts. They do not take this seriously, and continue to set arbitrary ""blackout days"" that I ""cannot have a high symptom day on"" without risking my job. As you know - this is nearly impossible to agree to given the variability of trigger events. I think they're trying to let me go... am I being paranoid or could this be their shady way of saying I'm in a job that doesn't exist so am ultimately downsized and they avoid the ADA protections?

Background on me: PTSD diagnosed , childhood trauma, I don’t remember a lot of my childhood and continue (as an adult) to go into black out mode when things get tough. I am a virgin who plans to stay one till marriage because of sexual trauma. 

I dated a guy for three months who lied a lot. It was the peak of my drinking problem (70 something days sober). I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend. He would drink nothing. I would go in my room thinking I passed out but we would still do sexual things that was not sex. Remember I am a virgin. 

One night I got so drunk I don’t remember making it to bed. He knew how much I drank. He never said anything. If anything encouraged by buying alcohol for me and my roommate. I woke up the next day with awful vaginal pain. When I peed it felt like my insides were ripped and I had blood in my urine. That lasted for three days before slowly fading away. When I asked my ex about it he said he used three fingers and that’s why. I didn’t think anything of it. 

I got drunk a few more times but not blackout and we do things again. I try to set boundaries with him about it realizing I needed to and he texted me “I didn’t rape you” I didn’t think anything of it because rape is such a triggering thing. I shut it down super quick. 

I don’t know if this is rape or not because when I would get drunk I would ask to have sex but he would say no. He knew I wanted to wait and he wanted to be a good boyfriend. But the three finger excuse didn’t make sense because we consensually used that many before and it didn’t feel that way. I didn’t feel torn and I didn’t bleed. Do you think he waited till I was so unconscious to do something? I didn’t bring up rape in the text but he jumped right in like he was ready to defend himself.

On my way back, a druggie said HEY BEAUTIFUL and eating me alive with his eyes. I didnt even acknowledge his presence. He stopped, and yelled back at me, you cant even say hi you white bitch. 

I'm walking to the subway and a group of younger city kids pass me, they start saying stuff to me and when they pass me, I still hear them. I say ""stfu"" as I pass them, fed up with the fucking day. They stop and threaten to fight me. 

I'm walking to get my dinner and on my way home a homeless man is screaming MISS MISS following me, I sprinted away. 

There is a building of projects across from me. Everytime I walk out there are these druggies lingering right across from me. I'm paranoid they know where I live. 

I'm going for a run and walking through the block to get to the river. I hear a guy say hi and whistling from a car parked on the street, but I didnt see which one it was coming from. 

I was walking to the river another day and a homeless drugged up man started saying hi and walking towards me and when I didnt respond and walked away he screamed IM GONNA GET YOU til I was out of distance. 

I go on the subway.. WITH my boyfriend for the first time in a while. A bunch of city kids get on and start doing a very very loud, screaming, violent type performance. I was triggered and they were stomping back and forth down the train cart. It was so long til the next stop. They kept coming over to us and across from me was the only other white girl on the cart. He puts his fist out for her to pound it. She didnt at first but he didnt move, so she did. Then he comes over to me and puts his fuckin fist out. My bf put his hand in front of me and pounded him for me. He walked away. He did this to the only two white girls on the train, even when I was with my bf. 

I was on a train alone and a bunch of city kids got on and were hanging from the subway handles and started talking shit about white girls and dumb bitches. 

I was walking to my apartment and heard a guysaying, blondie, blondieee behind me. 

I was walking on the river and a city guy passed me and said PUT A SMILE ON. Then I gave him a death stare and he called me a bitch. 

I've been raped by one of these city, drug dealer type guys. I live in this city alone. In my hometown these types of bad people would stalk me and pick on me for some reason. I'm a walking target. I dont feel safe leaving my house to go to the corner store. I'm scared to go on the subway to go ANYWHERE now. I dont have money to uber everywhere. It's so hard cause this could be real danger. It's so triggering and idk what to do. There is no one I know in this city or state. My bf is 2.5 hours away and very busy working full time. I am no contact and estranged from all family members and friends. I have a new therapist but even getting to her office is a fucking long trigger. 

AND WHAT PISSES ME OFF IS THAT.......if you dont respond to these people.. they WILL retaliate. And how fucked up is that? How fucked up is it to go on a subway and have a stranger shove their hand in your face for a ""pound."" And what if she didnt do it? She had no choice but to touch a fucking strangers hand that was invading her personal space, minding her own business on the train. They get mad when they are rejected because they look like idiots, when they are trying to be cool and have game when they do it. Are they trying to scare me on purpose? Are they this stupid? I shouldnt have to deal with this:-( I need a body guard. 

So I think.. I moved here bc I can walk places and the water and views. I used to love it. But I used to live in a nicer, expensive area that I cant afford. Even in those places there is crime.. I lived at my bf's before in the mountains and it was fucking hell. I didnt have a car and there were no stores within 30 min drive and no fun or anything. So I guess I need to settle for something in the middle. What sucks is that I am all alone.. I have no money or support... idk where I'll be at the end of the month.... my bf was supposed to get us a place but he bailed on me.. now I'm on my own. I feel bad getting mad at him for not visiting me, and not seeing him, and needing him just for me to leave my house and stuff.. I dont wanna put it on him but I literally have no one else. It's so hard. But then... I have nothing to loose."	[]	"[{'start': 2324, 'end': 2383, 'span': ""I've been raped by one of these city, drug dealer type guys"", 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

I'm new here but I have been looking for some help with this for a while and I thought I would try to see if someone from this community might be able to help. 

We are in the process of getting her to see a psychiatrist and start therapy, but until the medical insurance clears we can't do that. Until then, she has a habit of running off when she flashes back. When she does that she's sometimes in her PJs or without her phone. When that happens she ends up waking up lost and cold. She has also occasionally self-harmed while in a flashback. 

Due to all of these concerns, I would very much like to equip her with a GPS so that when she runs off I can find her quickly and bring her home ASAP. Does anyone have any tips on what kind to get? Or, perhaps some other tips about either other ways to deal with this or anything else. I am always open to suggestions.

5d70dd0b28805f001aaf9a94	2430_ptsd	"Having a hard time opening up to loved ones TW for all of this (rape, assault)

I’m 20 years old, female. When I was freshly 16, I was raped during a party in a small apartment, with the door open, and nobody helped me. I began acting out and getting in a lot of trouble after this, ultimately landing myself in acute inpatient for suicidal thoughts. I wrote my parents a letter telling them what happened to me, and social workers had to come in the hospital and report it with me. They never, ever contacted me or my parents EVER again. That alone is its own damage. 
2 years later, freshly 18 now, I began working as a houseman in a hotel. This means I cleaned everything except for inside the actual rooms. Well, there was a man that would stay Monday-Thursday for his construction job. He took an interest in me quickly, asking my age, where I go to school, then progressing into telling me I have “beautiful bedroom eyes” and “pure ness in my smile” I knew he was up to something. He then began asking me which car is mine, when do I get off work, will my parents be waiting on me to come home from work tonight, etc. I began to be paranoid even when I left work, getting trapped in moments of my 16 year old self, thinking nobody cares what would happen to me, because after all, the police don’t care about me.  At one point he entered the lady’s restroom where I was cleaning, had me in a corner, touched my arm and asked how I like the new job. :( 
One day, and this is so hard for me to tell because it became a repressed memory until my second hospitalization in October 2019, I was vacuuming the second floor hallway. Humming to myself probably, at the very start of this floor, the door to my left opened quickly. An arm, with orange hair and freckles, oh my god this is it, an arm grabs me. It was the man. He held me just inside the room, my left foot in the doorway. He told me to look in his eyes, gripped my arm tighter, and held me there. I was thinking to myself that this is it, he has me. He could’ve done whatever he wanted. It felt like my eyes were looking into his for years, and his eyes, they were like... glass. Empty, yet fiery.  My mind made me see myself, naked, beaten, raped, and left all alone in the woods to rot. He let me go and I finished my shift. I was in a state of denial, showing up to my following shift in the morning. When I got to the second floor again, I actually passed out, and I’ve never passed out! I completely fell to the ground, it felt like I swallowed a rock. 
Long story, but my entire 2018 consisted of horrible paranoid thoughts and migraines, but I had forgotten this incident for a long time, so my therapist and I had a hard time getting it under control. Now that I remember, my life is bad. I have also borderline personality disorder that causes me MUCH distress on a daily basis, but now I’m miserable. I have flashbacks during the day time, I can’t even take the trash out alone. I’ve lost all my friends. My relationships are shallow and meaningless, except for my boyfriend. I never feel safe. I have gotten to the point of accusing my father of trying to rape me (absolutely delusional, he’s never touched me) and had similar accusations to my friends and even my boyfriend at some points. Sometimes, when the flashbacks are bad and I can’t afford to buy my medical marijuana, I get stuck in loops of seeing my dead and raped body again. It’s horrible. I’m scared to tell my family what happened because it seems like... nothing happened. Nothing happened but I spend everyday asking myself if this existence is even fucking worth it.

TLDR; I already told my family about a trauma, and now I feel this new trauma is not enough to trouble them over. Or trouble myself over anymore."

Hey, I'm 16 and have been dealing with PTSD since 2014 and just recently relived a very similar event and caused me to lose all my progress. Feeling lost and have no clue what to do anymore.

Back in 2014 on christmas eve I saw a man get shot and killed while shopping for a ring for my mother. I was about 11 or 12 at the time and just didn't really know how to cope or understand it so I blocked it out until around 2017 when I accepted the fact that I did/do have PTSD and tried to acknowledge and work with it more. Before then I had been diagnosed with PTSD twice but chose to ignore it, even though I would constantly have nightmares and dealt with pretty bad insomnia along with paranoia. 

I'm currently in a tiny RV park in the fucking desert and just recently had to listen to a guy getting shot to death two RVs down from my own. It destroyed any progress I had previously made and I don't even know where to go from here anymore. Ever since then I've been waking up at 2-3am because of nightmares, I constantly feel so fucking numb and on edge, it's fucking terrible. His RV is still right there and everyday I look out the window and just see it there. I feel guilty for being so affected by it because my dad saw the body and is holding it together, I can't imagine how the victim's family feels.

I can't even remember how I really started to recover from the first event, I understand that the recent event is still extremely fresh but I just hate that I have to do this all over again. Life will be life, though. Shit happens and people are still just as cruel and senseless as they've always been.
 There's many more aspects to the murder that I'm scared to open up about that are also causing me issues but all I can say is that the victim won't get justice, the system in the tiny town I'm at is fucked and corrupted. 


I just really needed a place to let this out at for now until I am able to figure out whatever else I can do to help myself. As much as I hate it, I think I'll have to just give myself time."

5d70dd0b28805f001aaf9a94	2503_ptsd	"Anyone have elevated heart rate related to PTSD? I have my heart rate spike when I have to do things related to my PTSD. If so, how is it treated? PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE QUESTION IF YOU CAN, EVEN IF YOU DON’T READ THE REST!



Here is the long backstory you don’t have to read, since I really just want to know how other people have treated elevated heart rate related to PTSD:

I’m afraid I’m about to end up being treated for a heart condition I don’t have, as I only have heart rate spikes temporarily when my anxiety is triggered. It used to make me agoraphobic because I was so convinced I was going to have a heart attack and die &amp; really interrupted my ability to function &amp; would go months at a time without leaving my house at all. I worked through that and although I still get the racing heart when I have to do things that relate to the PTSD, I am able to tell myself that it’s temporary and will go away when the situation is over.  I used to take 6 msg of Xanax a day just to get out my front door and now I don’t need anything. 

Problem is that I also have ADHD which I do require medication for...I get goldfish brain to the point I had 3 car accidents in 3 weeks off medication. At my last visit the guy I saw had issues with my heart rate and told me to see my pcp &amp; get clearance to continue on the medication I was taking. I’ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don’t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn’t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn’t be enough and he’d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don’t know what to do.  

On top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I’m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I’m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we’re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they’d be better off because now I’m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control. He made me fill out the depression questionnaire (I was previously treated for major depression with TMS &amp; am on Prozac still) and I answered honestly about thinking my family would be better off if I was dead nearly every day and I was going to tell him that I was feeling very guilty about the impact of my mental health on my family. But he never picked up or even looked at the form. I left truly believing my family would be better off without me because now everything is about to get much worse for me and therefore them. So I’m obsessing about dying suddenly but also thinking I should die for the sake of my family. 

This whole event just upset me so much it made me start thinking about the whole traumatic event again in detail.and how unfair it is that the person that caused all this did 6 years in prison but got to move on with his life. And here I am 20 years later feeling sentenced to life. I know I’m going to be right back to having flashbacks and panic attacks and seeing his face in every stranger. I really wish I could restart this day and never go to that appointment. 

All of this could be over if I could just not have situational heart rate spikes but he offered me no solutions to what I can do about that. I’m hoping someone here has had similar issues and how you handled it. It’s not related to the medication because I’ve had this for decades even unmedicated and I purposely didn’t take it the last 3 days out of fear of this exact thing happening. So even if I just didn’t take it anymore, I’m still going to have these spikes that he says could stop my heart."

_____________________________

Got the diagnosis just two days ago. Got medication and appointments to therapy or whatever. I'm already dealing with nerve damage in my spine and going to have surgery for the third time in a few weeks - while that fucking sucks it got skyrocketed by this new plot twist. Really, really struggling.

It's been years, maybe 15 years since my NCO shot himself. My search team found him. Great dude. A real brotherly authority figure. Trying to not think too much about that.

I never thought that that could have been the reason for my decline after leaving the military. Depression, isolation, numbness, severe dissociation, feelings of dread and doom (which I didn't know until very recently is anxiety), can't stand a certain smell of forest etc, constantly think ""If he killed himself being the fucking champion he was. What chance do I have?"", self harmed for a year after I left the army which concluded in a suicide attempt which left a huge scare over my chest which also reminds me. 

Never thought anything about it, I could not see my own problems and when I did I didn't link it to PTSD as ""I haven't experienced anything traumatic"". Just pushing anything related to that away subconsciously. The psychologist said that they called it ""the evading illness"" internally as it's extremely common to just block it all and say that you are fine.

Well, you people know all that. 

I don't know. I just had to write something about it that says ""hey this happened"" to myself. Between this and the surgery I'm struggling to find the will to go on. All I see before me is a mountain I don't have the strength to climb. 

I got homework to ready as much as I can about PTSD but so far I've been avoiding it and just shitpost on reddit instead. I remember he asked if there was anything I wanted to do, like a goal, I could not answer because I don't get joy from anything - but today I realized what I wanted. I want to stop.

I was in a relationship with my ex for 7 years, he was physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abusive.

He controlled my every move and isolated me from every friend and family member I had. He would tell me how worthless I was constantly, threaten to cheat on me daily, and would actively cheat on me as often as possible. He stole thousands of dollars from me and continues to stalk, harass and threaten me even after leaving over 8 months ago. I feel like I’m living in a nightmare. I thought things would get better but they haven’t. I have nightmares almost every single night about him trying to kill me and no one being able to help me. I can still remember every punch and kick he inflicted on me. I can still remember when he forced me to have sex with him as I cried for him to stop.

It continued to get worse and worse, starting from disciplining for no reason and then at the time they divorced it it got to hitting with a closed fist every night. Then, 4 more years passed and my mom finally got full, but he had visitation every other weekend. As you can probably guess, it got worse. I was 16 when he finally tried to kill me by abandoning me up in upstate New York on a mountain with no food or water on a 12 hour hike (normally 12 hours). I got lost and too a long trail around and was out on my own for 36 more hours before I finally made it to the trail head and called the police. It took me so long because I had to free climb, I had to swim, and I had to drink from a river. That resulted in a very nasty virus that emptied my guts. The worst part of it though, was when he came to pick me up. He yelled at me and nearly decked me. He would have if it hadn't been for the officers there.

Its been 4 years now and I still remember every little thing about that incident. I think back to see if I did anything to deserve all of that but I cant remember anything. Recently though I have found the love of my life and they are helping a lot. Should I tell them

603758e41c4468b882a74700	1524_ptsd	"PTSD from forced sex work A bit of background here - I (29 F) was heavily involved in the drug scene back in my early twenties. Prior to that, in high school, I was very promiscuous (possibly as a result of taking medication meant for depression while actually being bipolar, perhaps sending me into a mania).

In my drug phase, there were lots of times I’d have sex for drugs. Sometimes I wouldn’t expect it - thinking that I could just pay the guy for my drugs like a normal transaction, but they ended up not wanting the money and I’d give in. 

the climax of it all happened when I was desperately looking for a fix and this guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help. I got in the car (I know, stupid as hell) and he ended up getting me a handful of pills. I didn’t know what they were, but I downed all of them. I passed out and then when I woke up, we were hundreds of miles away from where we originally met and he proceeds to explain to me that I’m “going to be working for him now”. He was a pimp. 

I spent the next few weeks in that situation - he took my cell phone, kept me drugged up, woke me up at 8am everyday to start working until the late hours of night. He’d yell at me if I had any bruises from someone being too rough with me. 

I had tried to kill my self then, but it didn’t work and woke up to him screaming at me about it.

The only way I was able to contact anyone was when I had developed an infection in my arm from IV drug use and he finally (after days of this) agreed to take me to the ER. I called my family from there and thankfully he agreed to just drop me off at the airport where they would pick me up.

I’ve talked about this many times in counseling, but it’s always been like I was talking about the weather. No emotion behind it, just nonchalantly telling the story.  

It wasn’t until very recently that I thought about the whole situation and realized that I had been kidnapped. That yes, I was looking for drugs and that was bad, but I was kidnapped and taken captive and used.

Since this realization, I’ve been having flashbacks, especially during sex. And having sex is a whole different can of worms for me - lots of times, my body doesn’t “feel” anything. It’s like I’m still in prostitution mode, where I act like I’m enjoying it but really can’t wait for it to be over. The only way I can get off is by imagining my partner having sex with other people - it’s like I can’t allow myself and my own body to experience pleasure. Imagining things like that make me feel like a creep and it takes
something that’s supposed to be intimate and skews it into this fucked up thing.


Last night, I felt it came to a head. I was having sex with my boyfriend and just began having flashbacks of my time as a prostitute - seeing images of guys putting money on the table, disassociating from my body and I then felt this sensation of such anger that I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted to bit my boyfriend across the face, scratch him, grab his face hard. I feel so terrible about it. I started crying and then of course that ruined the moment and the poor guy had no idea what was going through my head.

He knows some of what I’ve been through, but there’s so much he doesn’t know and doesn’t want to know. I don’t blame him. 


I want to enjoy sex again. I’m seeing a therapist and am on medication for bipolar, but this shit just haunts me. I can’t tell if I actually enjoy sex or just default to prostitute mode where i make all the sounds and motions of enjoying something, like I’m acting and playing the part. 

Does anyone else have similar stories that they can offer advice about? I’m in such a low spot. I’ve been contemplating suicide for feeling like such a burden.

We had 2 female helpers and 1 male helper. All of whom lived with us. The male helper and I used to spend lots of time together. I grew attached to him. I don’t remember exact moments but I remember singular pictures here and there of it. He was a well loved member of our family. In the beginning I never told anyone what he was doing to me. I loved and adored him, but absolutely hated what he did to me. He basically used my mouth as a whole.

Slowly after he left us, I was always confused as to what to make of it. Never telling anyone as I was scared that nobody would believe me. Eventually I told my older sister. This was when I was about 18 years old. She then forced me to tell my parents. 

After I told my parents, nothing was ever said about it. My biggest fear of not being believed was coming to life. This year when I am 24 years old I found out through my counsellor (whom I begged to see) that my dad doesn’t believe me.

I have lost my ability to do anything. The whole in my body and feeling of worthlessness has never been greater. I have this hatred that has built up for my father. I love my mother with all of my heart, and she really tries to love and support me. My biggest fear is losing my mother.

I don’t deserve the love and support that I get from these people.

603758e41c4468b882a74700	2166_ptsd	"Waking up at the same time every night (TW seeing death happen. Graphic detail.) I’m no stranger to C-PTSD. I was officially diagnosed in 2017 after major trauma I dealt with at the hands of a mental health facility. 

I know waking up myself and the whole household screaming in my sleep, hearing sounds and voices relating to my trauma, and sleeping with the lights on for years well. I was finding my symptoms easing and being easier to deal with in late 2019 thanks to extensive therapy and working through them one by one but then my Mom died on January 1st of this year right after midnight. 

It was the simple call and “we regret to inform you,” no. We had went to visit her in ICU. ICU had become a normal occurrence in the infections she kept having but she always bounced back. 

When we walked in, she didn’t seem any worse than the times before... and then a nurse pulled me to the side to tell me it was bad bad. 

I still didn’t believe it, but while we were there they said they were putting her on a ventilator, and I decided to stay the night. 

Due to my moms infection and my slight germaphobia, I didn’t feel comfortable holding her hand or being in cough range. Even before the ventilator, she couldn’t respond more than panicked eyes that never looked directly at me and hoarse “help me”’s between breaths. I couldn’t get her attention even when I did try to tell her it’d be okay and to comfort her. Seeing her like that was crushing me. I decided to let the nurses do their thing while I wished everyone on my social media a happy new year. 

The nurses came in and out to add meds and such to help her breathe, kicked me out to put the ventilator in, but when I was allowed back in they never were gone for more than 10 minutes. I watched my moms machine, and it didn’t stop beeping since we had gotten there but that was normal when o2 levels are below 90. 

She started calming down some so I laid down to sleep. I was checking my phone one last time for the night when a nurse came RUNNING in. 
The machine hadn’t made a different sound or anything but apparently my mother’s heart had stopped. 

Within seconds the room got filled with folks providing CPR. A doctor came in and told me to tell her if I wanted them to stop. 

5 minutes passed, then 7, then 10. It didn’t feel like I though. I’m just sitting there in shock and unsure what to do. The doctor informs me her ribs are broken and if she does suddenly make it she’s gonna be in a ton of pain but at this point we were just torturing her. 

Blood was in her breathing tube. Her eyes looked gone. I told them to stop. 

I remember feeling super numb and floaty. I hadn’t slept in months. My boyfriend wasn’t answering the phone and I didn’t know what the fuck to do but it didn’t matter because I couldn’t think. 

Eventually I just allowed the numb to take over. I had hoped that numb would stay for a bit but starting around February, I started waking up every night at 12:23 no matter when I go to sleep. 

I know why it’s happening, but at the same time, I just can’t get it under control. 

Once I’m awake I can’t go back to sleep until daylight and it’s getting real old. No matter what I take I’ll wake up. 

Luckily my job has been shut down over the Covid stuff, but I’m worried about when I do have to work again. 

Has anyone else dealt with this?

These two events have made it so that I am a needy and incredibly insecure shell of the person I used to be and it’s costing me a potential relationship with a man I care for very much. 

My mom left my dad when I was 16 because she wanted to be with the man she was cheating on him with and left her 3 kids behind because some stranger was more important.  We didn’t see her for months after she left and when we did it was just for a day and she was always drunk or *he* was there. 

My ex-husband would punish me for my feelings and emotions and would spend days and week and sometimes months neglecting and ignoring me only to then spend a day or two piling attention and affection on me until I was happy and then he’d go back to ignoring me.  He spend our first wedding anniversary ignoring me in favor of playing video games with his friends, he’d tell me he was going to play D&amp;D with his friends only to later tell me that he actually went to a kink party.  He manipulated me emotionally, he would gaslight me, make me feel as if I deserved all of the awful things he did, he would force himself on my sexually and then make me think that it was okay because we were married. 

So we are divorced and two years later I meet a man who is wonderful and so nice but he doesn’t want anyone to know we’re dating because he’s afraid his ex-wife will find out and try and take his son away from him.  Except it’s been 7 months and he sometimes doesn’t answer my texts for several hours, we can’t go anywhere if someone who knows us will be in case it gets back and he avoids answering my questions about where the relationship is heading. 

I hate it. I don’t understand what I’ve done to deserve this.  Why can’t anyone just love me? I just want to be with someone and feel safe and happy with them.   If my own mother didn’t even want me why would anyone else?

For my first job after college, I worked with a nonprofit in a third world country. Several of my American peers in this location discovered that I had never been in a relationship and never been kissed. There were good reasons - I’d spent much of my teens in the hospital, plus I was very committed to waiting for the right guy. 

Anyway, they decided that, this New Year’s Eve, they were going to get me my first kiss. “Everyone should get a kiss on New Years!” they said. “Go to the porch on XYZ building and we will arrange for the cutest guy we can find to come and kiss you!”

I stupidly got swept up in their excitement, and I agreed. 

On New Years Eve, I went to the porch on XYZ building. I waited. 

And up wandered a creepy old guy we worked with. He was easily old enough to be my grandfather. He was not attractive in any way. 

I turned and ran. I got back to my bunk, and when I entered my cabin, my friends (who had all been waiting there) burst out laughing. They just thought this had been the funniest thing imaginable. 

Then they got pissed at me for being angry at them. Why couldn’t I enjoy a harmless prank?

It’s been several years since then. I’ve grown, my ptsd has improved, my life is better... but man, when I remember that night, I still get so angry at them. 

They taught me that I’m not worth respecting, and that no one will ever want to kiss me. Those are hard lessons to unlearn. I can’t understand why they would do that.

603758e41c4468b882a74700	1613_ptsd	"PTSD from traumatic relationship vent/input So... this is my first time posting here... Not sure where I’m going with this. I’ve had my fair share of rough relationships, sure, who hasn’t? But the last few years has been beyond bad. Like ending a 10 year relationship, losing a job I loved bc of my mental health, trying to move on with someone else and dealing with mental torture that led to a suicide attempt bad. I feel so stupid and pathetic even typing this. I mean people have been through so much worse. Yeah I was sexually abused as a child but that was forever ago and I was never physically abused in my relationships. But on top of depression, anxiety, and avoidant personality disorder, I’ve also just been diagnosed with PTSD stemming from the last couple years. Maybe this is considered complex-PTSD and should be posted there instead? Sorry. 

It felt dumb to me hearing that. I know it’s possible. I guess I’m just in denial. But then I think about it. We didn’t even have a long relationship. 9 months. That’s nothing. But the last 3 months he inflicted more damage than I’d known in 10 years. I haven’t seen or spoken to him since my suicide attempt in September 2018. I’ve sought help. I’m on meds again and in therapy. I’m better than I used to be. Then today I got a message from his gf. There’s a whole backstory to her but it’s honestly just too complicated to explain right now. As soon as I saw her name everything came back. My heart was pounding out of my chest. I was lightheaded and dizzy. My chest was tight. I started sweating and felt like I couldn’t breathe. Like I was about to pass out. (Panic attack, I know) I could see him again perfectly. In my face screaming. I could hear him. Feel his skin. Smell him. Everything. I was watching a movie with my kids (they’re 13 and 11) so I calmly got up and went outside and just completely broke down.

I mean come on, it’s been a year and half. I feel like I’m doing better and then this happens and it’s like being kicked in the teeth right back to square one."

I found this year that i enjoy dulling down my reality instead of facing problems. 

 Drugs make me feel something, while dulling down the pain
I don't want to escape as much as i want to numb my thoughts from hurting myself. When my thoughts become verbal my moods lash out on others and it makes me hate my existence that much more. 
Which triggers a wave of suicidal thoughts, self doubt, and a can't do attitude. 
I just give up
I am sick and tired of holding the weight of these ideations within the thin barriers of my skull, im growing old and tierd.
When it started, i thought i brought these thoughts into my head, and i would feel shame for it. For why am i doing this to myself?
6 years later its gotten progressively worse, i quit drinking and began a regaulr pill regimen  (also smoking marajuana) to keep myself balanced, or calm. I was less on edge, found a bit of happiness within myself and my creative side and began to feel human again. 
Now the flip side to that is the rap sheet of side effects that come along with these pills.
Stabalize your mind, sacrifice your body.
It's taking a chance everytime, adverse reactions and misdiagnosis over those 6 years didn't help. By the timei was aged 25 i had been on or around 25 different pills and different combinations within of those pills. 
By the end of my 6 years medication tweaking process, and 3 misdiagnosis, 6 hospitalizations, and pretty much a team of specialists, and a dozen doctors,  along w a cat scan of my brain in 2014.
It took hell of a toll on my body, and brain functions. My liver an kidneys wont last forever..
The runaround, a serious uphill battle im still pushing through..learning a lot about my mind and mostly thought process.
Why am i so mean to myself? 

 and as of today my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder bi polar type, i struggle with anxiety (mostly social) and frequent panic attacks (which can be triggered by the way someone i know looks me wrong) me being called sensitive would be a huge understatement. Around the time of my first hospitalization in 2009 i witnessed my friend and roommate at the time get beat within an inch from his life with brass knuckles to the face. 
I remember nothing past the porch where he laid still, getting beat on our own front lawn repeatedly. 
My mind permanently blocked that from me.Next time i have a memory from that moment im looking over him-- laying in the blood soaked grass, in total shock. His face was a blood puddle, in panic mode i went and scooped him from his back to his feet. At that second i embraced his tall frail figure as his wounds dripped down onto my suicidal tendencies shirt (oh the irony)  my arms wrapped all the way around his body, for i just wanted him to feel safty or comfort. Grabbing him by the hand i guidedus to a safer space indoors.
Around me was a blur, friends and neighbors scolded me, for ""he could have a neck or back injury! Leave him laying!"" 
I was not only in shock, but also processing a violent and traumatic event that changed my life forever. 
I was scared, he was petrified. 
I told all the neighbors and by standers basically to fuck off and
As for my friend- now gushing blood from his cuts, eye sockets, mouth and nose. 
just like a skipping cd in your old walkman, he was stuck in a constant shuddering loop fearing for his life. 
""They're going to come back and kill me""
Over and over and over and over..
Once into our house i lead him into the bathroom, swiftly locking the door behind.
""Call 911, they're going to come back and kill me"" again and again as he ran water over his face, pressing his broken bone structure completely flat, blood pouring from all parts of his kind and beautiful face. 
He couldn't feel it, he could barely process what had happened, for it happened so fast. 
I watched him try to
Rinse all the blood away only more would streamout.&amp;Panic struck, the ambulance was now on its way but inwas starting to expierence by first delusion. 
After that summer i didn't see my friend again until 10 years later. 
What i said to him was, i have been through so much since then that stemmed from that dark moment in our past, struggled with literal demons inside my head, woken up to images of corpses laying in my bed. 
But i will never know how you managed to stay so strong, so beautiful, and so kind even after something so awful could happen. 
I have no idea how he did it i said, how he pulled through and came out on top.
Dude, he could have been beat to death if someone hadn't stepped in. 

One of the moments that shaped me, made me grow and helped me learn so much about myself id never had gotten the chance to if our paths may not have crossed. 
Cos i usually think ""man, i wonder what life would've became if these blips in time hadn't happened at all?""
Maybe id have some sort of success, or maybe just no chronic disorder that effects almost every aspect of my life in some sort of way. Im unsure, always wonder, then feel weak minded.
Soon after we went through this i found myself laying on my bare bed, last nights last breath escapingaway as the mourning sun crept through the crack in the window where the card board had shifted.
I stayed home all alone with my thoughts that night. 
Not knowing how many sleepless nights, and waking nightmares mixed with violent hallucinations id have ahead of me. 
The mind is a very fragile thing, science knows little about mental illness as it is-so to see me, 4 or 5 days later after that night, days became weeks then into one bad blurred summer.
To explain it all in full detail wouldn't make any sense whatsoever -but i basically looked like your local circle k crack head on no sleep talking to the air. 
Sad thing is, mental illness and drug addiction look a whole lot alike. 
Your brain looses one to many days of sleep then all the sudden i think im related to  Egyptian gods, and my brother is a cannabal living on an ancient Indian burial ground, and theres a government drone disguised as a house fly watching me.
The house was alive, and teeth snapped my feet at every step.
The windows were breathing. I sawa glimpse of a body on the stain in the laundry room, had conversations with hairless rats and sat in a chair crafted from hitlers bones.
I could feel the chill air pass, i felt negative spirits, saw shadow people while christmas carolers sang outside my door.
None of this was real, this was just a snipit of the things i've seen and heard but told they weren't really there. 
I was awake, yet dreaming in gruesome splashes and disorganized thoughts. 
I was alive to exist. 
I felt pain all over.
Once admited i was so unrulyi wasn't able to be near any other patients at least half a day to a day. I spent that time in the yellow hallway in the nude and a pair of flats, pissing on myself while flooding my room. 
When they brought my food, i ripped my name badge from the tray. I ate my name for dinner, refused the meal, kicking it across the hallway.
Water began to trickle out of my room, and by the time they asked me to get dressed they saw..
I shoved all the sheets, blankets and my clothes into the toilet, and sink only to keep them running and flushing til someone decided to check on my crazy naked ass.
I just didnt want to be alone.
So i made sure they had to keep me close, and segregating an unstable lil girl who wants to die and has no clue what reality is anymore is inhumane. 
I spent the next 3 weeks there making no damn sence, i was completely detached from reality coloring with crayons, banging my head inbetween the door way and the wall. 
It hurt everywhere in a different way, but they couldnt make it stop so i would hurt myself. 
I hadn't showered in over a week, 2 nurses insisted on helping me bathe. 
Once in the water all i could do was scream, cry and fight them.
I was 20.
Life hit different for me young, and life got in the way of a lot of things but it humbled m

603758e41c4468b882a74700	1915_ptsd	"Maybe PTSD? Okay, I'm gonna preface this by saying that sometimes I can be a hypochondriac, so there's a chance I'm overreacting.

My trauma comes from someone close to me attempting suicide, blaming it on me, and then continously blaming his suicidal feelings on me and saying he was thinking of killing himself and only telling me that and guilt tripping me when I tried to call him out on it.

My symptoms aren't severe, however, I've found myself avoiding the places where the catalyst for all of this happened, and I've had strange instances where I've had nightmares involving the catalyst playing out wordlessly, then turning into a fantasy situation of me running away. I can talk about it, but I will only talk about it if I'm the one who is in charge of the conversation.

But the worst that's happened is when I walked past that spot, as I need to to get home, I don't remember what happened except for a few splashes, which I remember as the guy who traumatised me. When I looked in car windows for my reflection, or thought, all I could hear were the words he said and all I could see was his reflection, and I could only picture myself as him.

My therapist said that it happens to a lot of people and that it's nothing to get caught up in, but should I push the possibility of maybe being a bit more traumatised than I've let on? I've only told her about the catalyst, and not everything about the catalyst."

Throwaway account because my boyfriend follows me .

Hello, I’m not exactly sure this will be beneficial for me but I  need to try I guess . From the age of 5 till the time I was 13 my cousin would  touch me and his sister. Fingering us “playing doctor” telling us that since it hurt it was our fault and something was wrong with us. See my cousin was caught with his sister but since I was so embarrassed I never said a things leading to her getting the help and therapy she needed while I dwelled with this self hatred for allowing it to continue so long.  I finally snapped and was hospitalized for trying to kill myself. I opened up to the psychiatrist as much as I felt comfortable doing. Which wasn’t much. Anyway I bounced between plenty of  therapists before giving up on therapy all together I’ve never really learned a good way to cope. (I had my first thoughts of self harm again recently and that’s scary to me I don’t want to fall back down that path) 
I recently got into a new relationship and I’ve never had a problem with this until recently. My mind likes to play this game where it twists the truth and so it has lead to a trust issue between me and my boyfriend. Which led to the flash backs returning, and it’s at very hard times like when we’re going to get intimate break down and start crying. Which makes me feel like complete shit as my boyfriend doesn’t deserve it.  he’s very patient and understands since I opened up to him about what happened. He stops right away to make sure I’m ok I just don’t feel like it’s fair to him (or myself)  Anyway I guess what I’m asking is how do I go about releasing this pent up trauma and how do I help myself cope?"

TW: rape, sexual abuse

\-A little over 2 years ago, my ex raped me. There had been about a year of sexual abuse leading up to the rape. The manipulation and gaslighting and little things like forced kisses and groping fucked me up just as much as the actual rape.

\-A few weeks later, I met my current BF and fiancee. I truly believed he saved me from further abuse. He helped me cut my ex out of my life.

\-My BF is my ex's uncle (though they are the same age, they're family), but they are not in contact with each other and don't interact with each other's immediate family frequently.

\-I have had a lot of trouble trusting people after my abuse, My friendships are mostly people who my BF is friends with, people who he trusts I believe are safe to be around and I am more comfortable around them.

\-My BF's two close friends are dating each other. They have been together for years. I thought they were in love. They are extremely good friends with my BF, and I liked them and was very interested in being close to them as well.

**THE INCIDEN**T: My BF's good friends were apart for a few days. One of them told my BF he cheated on his partner with My abusive ex. My ex has told their friends that He raped them. 

I am in absolute shambles. I have spent years avoiding contact with my ex. Now not only have my friend destroyed his relationship to ""have sex"" with him, but I believe my ex was raped by him. I have to cut off a friend who I tried so hard to warm up to and put myself out of my comfort zone to interact with because I discover he is a PoS. And now my rapist is coming to me wanting help after they have been raped. The poor partner who has had their relationship destroyed is coming to me for help. I believe my ex is going to tell their family about what happened, which includes me since I am engaged to their uncle. 

It has never crossed my mind to blame somebody for being assaulted, and I am not blaming my ex, but I really disgusting, horrible, ugly part of me can't help but be glad that they can experience all the hurt they caused me."

So.. this is mostly me sharing my story in a community of seemingly supportive people and then posing a question at the end.

To start, I'm a trans man and the events I'm discussing all occured when I identified as female, as a child. 
As all kids do, my sister and I would play pretend. She's about 2 years older than me, and we were always very nerdy, we would play as star trek characters or something and run around outside, sometimes we'd play as Mario characters. I was the younger sibling so I'd always get stuck playing the boy bc sis wanted to play as a girl. Eventually the Mario playing turned sexual, but here's the thing, we never actually touched each other, it would always be one of us just sitting on the other and stuff like that. It's very rare for me to remember things that happened to me when I was a child because of how badly I was bullied and beaten in school. (A kid damaged my eye so badly that my vision is damaged for life and I have to wear glasses.) This leads me to believe u have ptsd because I block out like all of school from my memories. Anyway, the events with sis went on until I was probably 12 or 13, her being 14-16. I'm 16 now and I can't imagine thinking its acceptable to play with a kid in that way. To describe it better it basically turned into roleplaying. We would act out sex with the motions and sounds but never actually do more than grind basically. Can someone please help? Should I get therapy? Was it rape? Would this contribute if I did have trauma and now developed ptsd? Thank you for reading."

5fc6c66db312473beedf9d4a	2534_ptsd	"My toxic relationship with my dad is still affecting me As a young girl, my father was always hard on me... a little more than my brother. Always strict with my grades (understandable), but he also had a control problem. He always had to control everything relating to my family, even controlled my mother to the point where she wasn’t allowed to spend any money from her own paycheck or wear any makeup to work. He was also emotionally &amp; mentally abusive to her, and emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive to my brother &amp; I on a daily basis (again, I always got it more than him). 

When I was a sophomore in high school, I was 5’5” and a healthy 135-140 lbs. I was a small in tops and about a 6 in jeans, so I was never really considered fat or even overweight, just healthy. During this year, my dad became weirdly obsessed with my weight. He would force me to run and do at home exercises daily, he would also weigh me about once a week. Now, don’t get me wrong, I feel like if I were the slightest bit overweight/unhealthy then maybe he could of approached differently, like suggesting to eat better or maybe join him in some of his workouts. But no, I wasn’t overweight and he FORCED me to workout. By my senior year of high school his obsession grew even grater. He was weighing me every morning and making me do more intense workouts to lose weight. I ended up weighing 117 lbs by the middle of my senior year. I was so skinny that I looked unhealthy, my collarbones would pop out. I wouldn’t eat much around friends because I was afraid that if I did eat like a normal person, I’d gain weight so I just told my friends excuses like I wasn’t hungry or I had already eaten earlier. They would always tell me that I was too skinny and if everything was okay with me. I would end up telling my parents and my dad would respond with “they say that because they are jealous.” 

If I didn’t weigh 117 lbs every morning- for example, if I weighted the SLIGHTEST bit over 117, like 117.4 lbs then he’d take my phone away for the day, it would also cause him to get mad at me for gaining an extra 0.4 lbs which would usually end up in a verbal fight and then him hitting me (at 18 years old- and even though I was technically 18 he still controlled everything in my life... my phone, the money that I made at my part time jobs, my car).  I would only get my phone/car/friend privileges back if I weighed 117 lbs the next day. Weeks would go by and I would be stuck at 118-119 lbs, and even though I was doing all the workouts he made me do and barely eating, my weight would fluctuate, especially during my time of the month. So I would go weeks without my phone even though I was driving from school to work/cheerleading practice, so if something were to happen while I was driving I had no way of calling for help. 

I remember not having a phone to take pictures with my friends on graduation day because I weighed the slightest bit over 117. This obsession continued into my freshman year of college when he forced me to live at home and commute to still have every bit of control over me. So, it was another year of weighing me every morning, physical &amp; emotional abuse if I didn’t weigh what he wanted me to. I remember one day weighing 120 lbs and he looked at me like he was disgusted by the 3 pounds I had gained and called me fat, and would point out and say that my legs were already bigger from the day before even though I physically still looked the same, but my weight would change because, like I said, it is normal for your weight to fluctuate a couple of pounds. This minor change in weight could be cause by lots of things like retaining water. This continued up until the July before I started my sophomore year of college. 

That July, he was mandated to leave my house because him and my mom were fighting and he hit her in the face and she told me to call the police, so I did. When he was getting escorted out by the police, I remember him turning to me and saying “you’re the devil. I hate you.” But what else was I going to do? He literally HIT my mom in the face, let alone the lifetime of physical abuse he caused to my brother and I. Fast forward 4 years.... I live with my mom, and my dad and I have a rocky relationship. I love him because he’s my dad. I know he’s always wanted the best for me but due to his narcissistic and controlling ways, he’s had an awful way of showing it. I suffer from diagnosed anxiety, depression and PTSD from my childhood up until my early adult years. He still hasn’t apologized for anything that he’s done, nor realizes that he’s the main reason I have those disorders. I’ve tried to tell him repeatedly that what he did and what he continues to do is not right (no physical abuse anymore, just emotional and mental), including making me feel guilty for things or bad about myself. He also blames everyone else for getting arrested the day he hit my mother. I don’t know what else to do to help him change or to at least recognize what he’s been doing has truly damaged me.

I have been avoiding water for years. I grew up swimming regularly, but it's been six years since I did, and ten years since I stopped regularly going. 

I've had episodes for a while now, on and off. Bad nightmares. Visceral nightmares. I'd go into detail but I'm trying not to trigger anyone.

Then I started getting flashbacks. My sister used to attack me. She used to choke me, drown me, and physically attack me.

My father would go on rampages that I was always terrified would escalate to violence but rarely did. 

Two weeks ago, I had... an episode. Something I haven't had in that severity since 2008. My fiancee made a comment like my father would have made, before he would force an intense cleaning episode where he screamed at me for an hour while I cleaned as fast as possible while crying. I don't fully remember all of what happened, but I threw money at her, told her I was a worthless piece of shit, did all of the chores I could manage (made myself sick while doing so) and then climbed under the bed to cry. 

It was... intense. She and I made a plan for what to do if it were to happen again, but it's scary to me that it happened, so I finally bit the bullet and am getting a consultation with a therapist that specializes in CBT and PTSD.

I was feeling a bit gloomy after a flash-back, but as I kept writing I started to calm down. Hence the change in the tone.

Also, I wanted to point out that what I'm talking about is obviously just a small part of the process of getting back on your feet, but still it felt essential to me. Everyone's experience is different and this is just my personal perspective. 

Sorry for my broken English, I hope this can be helpful to someone. 

I guess I have improved a lot in the last year. 
I really don't want to go back to the hole of despair I was trapped in, but sometimes I get scared I might let myself slip off into it again.

To prevent that, I make sure to bury any thoughts about my past very deep as soon as I sense them arise, of course some of them manage to sneak out and they get back at me in spades.

I still get glimpses of moments I had successfully forgotten about. 
It makes me feel like I'm still there, but it happens less and less frequently and every time it gets easier to snap back. 

Up until a year ago, I was leading a life that was split in half between the present and the past. 
The present seemed to be so dull, as if I were half-asleep, while the past felt so much more real and threatening.

I used to be so angry, I don't know how else to describe it other than it felt like fire was running through my veins. It was the only thing I felt and I couldn't help but cling to it, since it seemed to be my life's sole purpose and sustenance.
 
I kept reliving the events of my trauma, going through them in my head over and over again. Each time getting angrier and angrier. 
I didn't mind it at all, I was actually glad for this blind rage. As if it fueled me. 

**START OF TRIGGER WARNING**

I had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. 

**END OF TRIGGER WARNING**

After I escaped, ordinary life was simply idle.
Hadn't it been for this anger, I would have just gone numb.

Although comforting, I came to realize that I would have never been able to move forward without letting go of it all, the anger, the constant replay of gruesome scenes in my mind, the pointless questions that would never find any answers.

Things were also getting out of hand, to the point where I involuntarily broke my friend's arm as I was startled by her giving me a hug unexpectedly. 
I was horrified at what I had done. 
I'm a petite girl but I've been fighting professionally for a long time and I couldn't bear the thought of harming someone whose only fault was getting caught between my messed up brain and me. 

It's a hard process to forget about the abuse I had been through as a child and then again as an adult, but I'm managing and it does get easier. 
I had never thought it to be true, but time really does heal all wounds.

But most importantly it's the people you love. Keep them close. Even if you feel the need to cut everybody off and confine yourself in your pain, don't. Don't let this trauma induced sentiment prevail.
It's not what you or your loved ones need. 
The ones we care about are the only thing that keeps us grounded to reality, to the present. 
You can take small steps, there's no rush, you don't have to let everyone in on everything you are feeling unless you want to. Just try, as difficult as it is, to be open to their affection. 

Being passionate about something is hard after you have survived trauma and readjusting to everyday life is particularly disorienting when you don't have a purpose, you just feel hollow. A good place to start is making it a point to be able to take care of the people you love. Having to be someone your dear ones can rely on, eventually makes you get back on track and you are going to become even stronger than you were before. 

It's ironic how being a survivor makes you feel so dead inside, it might feel like you have lost all control over your own body and mind. 
But please know this kind of feelings are only temporary. You have gone through a nightmare and made it out alive. You will overcome these feelings as well. 
 
You won't have to look back at the person you were before in sorrow, you are growing to become someone you will learn to love. 
You will have suffered greatly and still been able to pull yourself back up, you can accomplish anything you put your mind to.

# Family Makeup

(If you want to get to the question at hand without my life story, just skip to the heading ""The Dilemma"")

I am from a large family. Middle child of 7.

I never really knew my father (for the best, really. I have zero desire to know him), because he was sent to prison (rightfully so) when I was very young. Before I can remember, honestly. But my brother and I were his sons. My parents had 3 other children before us, my 3 older half-siblings (I rarely call them half-siblings, only for clarity sake when detailing family histories). This story really doesn't include my older half-siblings for the most part, only briefly. They are 10, 9, and 4 years older than me.

When I was 2 or 3, my mother met and married a new man, we will call him Harry (his name was not Harry). And they had a daughter together, my younger half-sister. So, my younger brother, younger sister, and I were all born within 3.5 years of each other, my younger half-sister being 3.5 years younger than me.  My father also had another daughter when I was 13. So, my siblings and I range in birth years from 1975 to 2003.

But really, this story focuses on me, my younger full-brother (11 months younger than me), my younger half-sister (3.5 years younger than me), my mother, and my step-father.

# The Wretched Brothers (TW: Physical and Verbal/Emotional Abuse)

So, my step-father would abuse my brother and me, a lot. Every night. He was an alcoholic, and would often beat my brother and me, along with more severe physical abuse (&gt;!burning us with cigarettes and coffee irons, pushing us down the stairs, locking us in the basement, forcing us to sleep on tiles floors underneath a pool table.... so much. We would have bruises and burns that we had to hide from school officials. !&lt;). Not only did he physically abuse my brother and me, he also abused our mother in similar ways. The infraction could be as mundane as ... well nothing. Sometimes, I am convinced he just did these things because he enjoyed to see us suffer. Honestly. Because we would do absolutely nothing, but get punished for it. Spilled milk? Punished. Breathed too loudly? Punished. Sat in the corner minding our own business? Punished. And by ""punished,"" I mean the abuse that I have hidden under spoiler tags.

But, though the physical abuse was intense, the emotional/verbal abuse was much, much worse. A bruise can heal, but the things he said to us affected our whole lives. This was much more than just being overly critical or saying hurtful things now-and-then. This was constant. He would call us the worse things imaginable. He refused to let us go anywhere because he said that we were thieves (we weren't). Every night, he would angrily tell us how worthless we were, calling us the most vile names. We were locked in the basement when company was over because we would ""embarrass him.""

Now, looking back to when I was a kid, from what I remember, we were pretty much like every other child (I had some bizarre idiosyncrasies, but my brother was completely normal, honestly). And asking people who knew us from that time, we were regarded as pretty delightful children, who weren't prone to mischief more so than any other child. Actually, we were described as timid and respectful.

Basically, the abuse did not match our behavior. And even if we were the terrifically unruly children that he said we were, we didn't deserve *that.*

Alongside the physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, there was also neglect. We didn't have beds, and were forced to sleep on the tile floor under the pool table. We rarely got the clothes we needed, having to wear clothes that we obviously had outgrew. And, for a time, we were homeless and couldn't get food. Much of this was due to abject poverty, but even when we weren't in dire straits, we were still not afforded the necessities. This also falls somewhat on my mother, but that is unfair to blame her for any of this, which I will expound upon later.

# The Golden Child

I suspect you saw this coming. My brother and I were abused and neglected, and my younger half-sister could do no wrong. Now, of course, she was his daughter. And in many ways, she was raised as if she was an only child. While my brother, my mother, and I were relegated to the basement floor, my half-sister lived a life of privilege upstairs. She got all the newest clothes. She had her own room with a bed. She got anything she ever wanted. And, growing up in a household like this, I assumed this is just how life was. Boys were treated like trash, and girls were treated like royalty. It made sense at the time, I suppose (mind you, I was under 12).

I cannot tell you how many times my brother and I would be punished for something my sister did. We would *watch* our sister do something terrible, then blame it on us, and we would get punished. Then our mother/step-father would praise her for being brave enough to tell! It was infuriating!!! No matter how much my brother and I protested and told the truth, no one believed us. My sister laughs about this to this day.

Now, looking back she too was being abused, just in a different way. The favorite(s) is(are) being abused just as much as the scapegoat(s). It is just a different dynamic.

To illustrate how different our lives were, my older half-sister on my father's side would call to talk to my brother and me. We weren't allowed to talk to her, but my younger half-sister would have full conversation with her. I didn't find this out until I was an adult, and my older half-sister told me. No one told us that my older half-sister called us ever. But, every time she called, she got to speak with my younger half-sister. Mind you, they are not related in any way (I suppose they share two half-brothers).

# The Nightmare Ends

From the time I was 3, until the time I was 12, this was my life (with a small respite when my mother finally got fed up with it all and left him for a few months). Nothing I did was good enough (a trait that has followed me throughout life). Daily being abused. Watching our sister live an entirely different life. And having nothing to compare it to, because to us, this was how things *are.* We didn't know it wasn't normal to be treated like this. It wasn't until maybe high school that I realized, ""Wow, people didn't live like this!"" But, it finally ended one day in October when I was 12.

Harry died unexpectedly. I shed not a single tear. I was sad for my sister. I was somewhat sad for my mother. I was sad for Harry's parents. But, in almost all ways, I was relieved and happy he was dead. So was my brother. And I suspect, my mother was at least relieved he would no longer torture any of us.

My sister was 8 years old at the time.

# My Dear Mother

I love my mother. I feel like she did the best with what she had. She loved each of us intensely. She had an infectious laugh, and a caring spirit. She was a joy to be around. Most of the time.

Counterintuitively, my most horrific memories have to do with my mother. You see, she was schizophrenic, and because of that, every single one of us children went through some awful experiences.

Now, when she was not experiencing a psychotic episode, she was the loving, amazing woman we all adored. But during those true psychotic episodes (of which she had no control over, having breakthrough episodes even on her medication), I and my siblings experienced some of the most traumatic experiences of our lives. Later in life, while I was an adult, so more prepared to cope with the trauma, my mother once blew up her oxygen tank, setting fire to her assisted living facility. Throughout the years, she had numerous episodes.

This is why I rarely blame my mother for not doing enough to protect us and herself. She was scared herself. Harry, on more than one occasion, &gt;!threatened to kill her and my brother and me. My mother would tell us that she would often wake up with Harry strangling her in the middle of the night. Plus, he was a hunter, and kept her gunpoint - metaphorically.!&lt; Add this with her underlying mental illness, and it is very difficult to assign any blame to my mother. She couldn't work, and at the time, she couldn't get on disability either. The one time she did find the courage to leave Harry, we ended up starving, freezing, and homeless. And then Harry came to stay with us while homeless, before eventually moving us to his car, then his parent's motorhome, and then finally.. the basement.

Since my mother was in a vulnerable position (her mental health and having no income due to disability), it just seems like predatory men found her, and made her life (and her children's lives) miserable.

In my head, yes, the experiences were traumatic, but in the same way a hurricane or earthquake is traumatic. Who do you blame?

# The Aftermath

So, now it is well over 20 years since Harry died. My mother passed in 2013 due to lung cancer/COPD. I have spent years in therapy, trying to heal. Even tried to be a therapist myself (big mistake. Trigger. Trigger. Trigger. HOSPITAL!). I have lived with daily SI since probably the time I was 9, and have had nearly 20 psych hospitalizations throughout the last 20 years. I am living knowing that I survived quite an ordeal.

But, my brother did not survive Harry's abuse. He died by suicide when he was 17. Clearly, Harry wasn't the only trauma that we had experienced. Often times when my mother would have a psychotic episode, my brother and I would be shuffled in and out of foster care. Sometimes together, sometimes apart. One time we were put in juvenile detention because we were ""too old for foster care."" We were 13 and 14. We had different privileges than everyone else because we weren't there for ""delinquency,"" which actually made us more of targets (we got treated differently by staff, so the other boys would beat us, and one &gt;!sexually assaulted us.!&lt;

I got emancipated when I was 16. Had my own apartment. Went into the Army. Became an Army nurse. And here's the thing - basic training was *fun.* It was a breeze compared to what I had experienced earlier in life. Got out of the Army, went to college. Made a life as best as I could.

But even now, one thing still bugs me.

# The Dilemma

So, now whenever I bring up Harry around my half-sister, she gets angry. She has said that I am exaggerating what happened, and that it wasn't that bad. I love my sister, and we are actually very close, but this is a real kicker.

She doesn't even acknowledge that her father did anything wrong. Which makes me question my own experiences. But it isn't like I am the only one saying these terrible things about her father. My mother confirmed what happened. My older siblings confirmed what happened. Even one of my half-sister's *cousins* confirmed what happened.

Which was oddly satisfying when I learned that her cousin confirmed the abuse. I was very active in church, and so during testimony, I would sometimes detail some of the experiences I had with Harry. I had a church mentor/friend who thought I was exaggerating, because to her, it sounded so outrageous, it must not have happened.

Well, I started working for this church mentor/friend, and a few years later, we bring in a new employee. Without my permission, my boss/mentor/friend starts divulging my personal history to this new employee (yes, I realize how inappropriate this is). During the conversation the new employee thought it was weird how similar it was to the story of her aunt's and uncle's family house. Turns out, my half-sister is the employee's cousin once removed (my step-father is her cousin). She then goes on to inform my boss/mentor/friend how terrible the situation actually was, and that I might even have been minimizing what happened, definitely not exaggerating. This was a cousin who I was not even allowed to see because it would ""embarrass"" my step-father. Any time she would come to visit, we were locked in the basement.

How can my half-sister not acknowledge this? At least say something like ""I know my father was a complicated man, I still love him, but I abhor what he did to my two brothers."" Or... anything? To her, ""Harry did nothing wrong, and the things he did do, y'all deserved it. And actually, it was our *mom* who messed us all up, not my dad.""

It is hurtful and infuriating. To the point that we cannot talk about her dad at all.

I know I can’t *technically* have PTSD unless you’re still displaying symptoms 1 month post-trauma, but  having a really hard time coping with it all. I know I can’t think about all the ‘what if’s’ but it’s so fucking hard not to..

My life was changed the morning of Wednesday April 10th, 2019. I am not the same person I was prior to the explosion, and it’s so fucking sad/scary/idek how to really describe it.. I was kind of a mess of a person before everything happened. Super fucking anxious and the weirdest ambivert. I avoided eye contact and got spooked easily and idk man people just make me nervous and it gets even worse in social settings. I’ve been on SSRIs for years and have seen multiple therapists and have honestly just been dealing with the highs and lows of mental illness. I’m just a research technician in an academic lab, enjoy my quiet work days and just keep to myself, while helping my bosses and post-docs with whatever’s going on that week. 

I’ll try to keep it short, but there was a natural gas explosion directly across the street from our vivarium right after my boss and I finished an experiment. As soon as he opened the door, jokingly said ‘Hmm it smells like gas. Best walk briskly so we don’t get blown up!’ I saw the construction workers across the street crowded around where I occasionally park when running late. I have a HORRIBLE sense of smell, so I was taking in the air, trying to remember what natural gas smelled like. Continuing down the sidewalk, I remember saying, ‘good thing you’re here because you know I can’t smell, I wouldn’t have had a clue!’ 

There were 2 seconds left on the crosswalk; knowing he’s a stickler with the rules I quickly paused as I watched my boss step into the road, speed walking through the white lines of the intersection. As soon as we crossed the street.. BOOM!!! 

It was almost an out of body experience, the whole thing really. The shock wave from the explosion pushed us down the sidewalk, I felt it go through my body and down the sidewalk in front of me. All of the windows outside the building next to us instantaneously shattered, raining down on us and into our eyes.. I remember looking at my boss as he screamed at me to run. 

My ears.. it was like a tornado had just ripped through my head.. then then the pounding and ringing started. I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn’t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming ‘WHAT THE FUCK’ at each other out of shock.

People starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating ‘don’t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.’ I remember the confused look on their faces..

It’s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I’m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me. If we had finished our experiment a minute later, or stayed at the crosswalk, or happened to walk at a slower pace.. it’s so fucking terrifying. I’m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. 

Begging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they’re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it’s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...

It’s only been 4 days, but it feels like it’s been an eternity. I didn’t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it’s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...

I do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. 


But at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen? It’s all so surreal and yes I’m extremely thankful to be alive, but the survivors guilt immediately crept in. I’m a trained BLS instructor, and I just ran.. I understand there was nothing I could do to save anyone, but I still feel so much guilt and shame.. 

I just needed to get it all out. Advice on moving forward is welcome/appreciated. 


RIP Mr. Lee, and condolences to the Kaffeinate family.

56a7eeb0c89737000c225efb	2485_ptsd	"Want to Share a bit of my Story (TW: sexual abuse) So right now I'm going through a formal process of bringing ti light some sexual harassment I've suffered, and it's triggered me badly regarding the sexual abuse I endured as a very young adult. I have rarely spoken about it since it happened. I was disssauded from being public about it, and I now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. 

Because being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. Now I'm realizing I want to be more open, but I thought the Internet is a good place to start. Part of my issue with sharing is that I can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although I logically know that of course people have. 

This story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile:

Well I began being groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17. I was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so I was the perfect target  At age 18 he started with the sexual advances and I was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. 

He was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was I ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. His wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and I had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. 

And meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). 

In the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.

There were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.

 While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. 

This man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood. I never got to complete my university degree because I was trapped under him when I should have been there. Also the abuse most likely triggered my health genes, because now I have several quite severe chronic health conditions.

 I completely lost my ability to trust people, and most of my family and friend relationships have failed. Because I can't work, I can't afford proper health care or therapy. I have lost my sense of self under his control with the immense psychological brainwashing and I don't think I'll ever completely get it back or even half, especially without the proper help. 

I don't live with a victim mentality but I think it's fair to say that this man has pretty much destroyed me.

Thank you for reading my account because I need to get it out."

56a7eeb0c89737000c225efb	2082_ptsd	"Do I have PTSD? I'm sorry if I'm ignorant and offend anyone who does have to deal with PTSD everyday, but here's my story:

Ever since I joined the military 3+ years ago at the age of 23, my life has improved dramatically, I was truly happy and felt like myself. I was doing ""wild"" things like partying and clubbing on the weekends and even one night stands with strangers from the bar or online dating apps, and other ""wild fun"" things (that I prefer not to mention for the sake of my career) I would NEVER thought I'd do based on who I ""was"" prior military.

However, the happier I'm becoming the more angrier I have been getting lately thinking about my past. I'm talking about being cheerful and jolly one minute, singing with the radio driving home from work then suddenly out of no where I'll have flashbacks of shitty times in my childhood    and next thing you know I'm punching my steering wheel and clenching my jaw and just really want to fly back across the United States just to give my family whom I RARELY talk to now, a piece of my mind.

 I grew up in a conservative Chinese family. Being a Chinese male, I had a very ""stereotypical"" boring childhood and even lamer time in highschool and college. However, I was not a good student and was a handful as a child that I will admit but I have never thought that my family was abusive until lately and even talked to my co-workers about it.

To keep things from getting too long I'll list out the things I experienced growing up and always thought was normal until my coworkers and friends pointed out it really wasn't:

- I was strongly influenced to not have friends and always put my family before anyone.

- Even until I was 22 years old I was not to be trusted to have friends over the house without an adult or my brother whom was allowed to have friends over anytime he pleased since he was 18

- My brother (5 years older than me) got to decide whether I can go out or must stay home regardless if there was a reason or not.

- My brother can also tell me I can't have any friends over even when I was 21 years old and still lived with me and my parents.

- My brother would enforce me as a child to ""pat-down"" all my friends who came over to the apartment we lived in to ensure nobody stole anything. This rule did not apply to my brother's friends.

- My mother has threatened to kill herself  and me multiple times when I was a child growing up. Sometimes she would take a meat cleaver to her neck and scream at me and my brother that shes going to cut her head off and kill herself because of us. And sometimes -

- My mother would swerve into the wrong side of the road towards oncoming traffic when we were bad, threatening to kill us and herself.

- When my brother was old enough to drive and he would also swerve into oncoming traffic if I he was mad at me or if we got into a disagreement.

- Ironically, when I was old enough to drive, I also did the same thing to a friend who is still considered one of my closest friend to this day. He pissed me off and I thought threatening his life would help me win the argument.

- I also remember when I was very young my mom told me not to go outside because I had some kind of allergy or Asthma, I did not listen and helped my grandma with her yard because she was going to pay me 20$. I told her and she put her hands around my neck shook my neck and told me she was going to kill me, very angrily and very convincing at least at the time to me.

- More less severe things is that my brother acted like he owned me, like if I wanted to go out and my mother said I could and my brother said I can't he would threaten to take away my games.

- whenever he disallowed me to do things he would sometimes include statements like ""not in my house"" this fucking bitch didn't own shit. He's had three cars handed to him and gave me shit and tried to claim he bought one of the my mom bought him brand new, which I confronted my mom about. 

- I believe my step-dad might have caught on to my brother's bullshit and convinced my mom and him that it was time for him to move out.

Anyways , I literally just started having angry flashbacks just now while writing the last three. I think I have more of a grudge towards my brother than my mother. I'll stop here before I go on forever but thank you for those who read this far, I honestly feel that I needed this more to vent than to really seek an answer."

56a7eeb0c89737000c225efb	1636_ptsd	"I don't know if this actually happened to me or not. I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""new version"" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the ""original"" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.

&amp;#x200B;

 Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)

&amp;#x200B;

So what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a ""substitute"" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy?

I went no contact but she tried hoovering me back in using various tactics such as apologising then blaming then guilt trips then a major family problem. I've stayed no contact but I feel like shit.

I feel like my relationship with my boyfriend is strained at times because of my triggers/responses even though I’ve tried to explain it to him. 

For example, he sometimes reaches out and touches me while he’s talking (like when he’s making a point). Last week, I shrunk back from his touch and he looked at me like I was the Antichrist. I told him that I don’t like to be poked or touched unexpectedly, but he still didn’t seem to understand. This has nothing to do with him and it’s a reflexive response for me. 

One major trigger for me is violence, screaming etc. in movies...especially in the evening or near bed time because I have nightmares. I’ve left the room before and gone to watch TV in the bedroom when he and my daughter were watching a scary movie and there was no issue. I’ve told him many times that movies can be triggering for me. Last night, a movie came on where a woman was getting ready for a bed and a man in a mask was lurking outside. The music got ominous and I knew I had to get out of there FAST. I quickly went to the other room and turned the TV on to drown it out. I could feel my heart racing and my breath quickening just imagining what was happening on that TV in the other room. If he wanted to watch that movie, I was ok with it, I just couldn’t be in that room. He came in and told me we needed to have a conversation about communication and how those situations could be better handled in the future. I told him that I left the room quickly because I knew something was coming and didn’t want to see/hear it since it was close to bed time. I said it had nothing to do with him and I wasn’t angry or anything. He continued to try to have a conversation about communication with me in that moment. I resented it. I feel like I did what I needed to in that moment to feel safe, and because it made him slightly uncomfortable, he was forcing me into a conversation I didn’t want to have. He implied that I wasn’t an adult.

I have been suicidal at a number of points in my life, am an alcoholic and have done a lot of shitty things over the years to deal with my trauma. I’m now almost 4 months sober and am really trying to be better. Leaving the room felt like the right thing to do in the moment and was a lot better strategy than things I have done in the past. I can’t always articulate how I feel and I don’t always want to. I don’t want to always have to explain why I need to leave the room. It’s really discouraging to feel like I’m making progress and have someone treat me like I’m overreacting or a child. I know he means well and that he loves me, but it’s discouraging."

title kind of explains it all but here's my story. yesterday i was at pride for the first time ever. my parents aren't all that supportive of the LGBT community so it took me years to find the courage to go. we were one block over from the main event because we wanted to get food and suddenly a guy runs by and yells ""don't go that way"" but we don't see anything so we keep walking and suddenly a flood of people is running towards us and yelling ""RUN"" so we start running and we get caught in this stampede and there's people falling and tripping and suddenly i hear a loud noise and i've grown up around guns so i don't really scare easy but this sounded exactly like a gun shot and i've never run faster in my life and then we're ushered into this building and there's maybe fifty people crammed in and people including adults are crying and holding their kids, people are praying, people are calling their loved ones. i called my mom and had to tell her i loved her and that i was safe but i didn't know what was happening and to tell my dad too because he was on a plane to india and i din't even get to say goodbye to him because i left before he went to the airport and then my friend and i just kinda took charge because nobody else was and we didn't know what was going on. i have no regard for my personal safety so i ran outside to find a cop and all i hear is ""gun in custody, no dead, people injured"" so as i'm running back into the building a second wave of people starts running and i barely make it back into the building before getting trampled and there's even more people and two girls are having massive panic attacks and there was no cell service and the news wasn't updating on anything so we didn't have any information on what was happening and nobody would say anything and there were a bunch of cops outside but for an hour we were in a complete communications blackout and i thought there was a shooter and i was going to die. when i got home and i was in service i found out that there was a fight and somebody whipped out a gun and chaos ensued. i really didn't feel anything while it was happening. my hands weren't shaking at all and when i got home i couldn't even cry but today i was at the pool and walking in and outside there was chalk on the ground that said ""RUN"" and my stomach immediately dropped for no real reason and then inside there were people playing water polo and they missed the goal and the ball made the same sound i heard when i was running yesterday and after i left i got in my car and i just started crying for ten minutes. afterwards i was out with my friend and some kids ran past us and again my stomach just dropped and i was back in that moment. we saw a movie and this guy kept walking in and out of the theater and all i could think about was how there was nowhere to hide. 

&amp;#x200B;

that's my story. i feel like i'm just overreacting because there wasn't actually a shooter and so many other people actually have lived through shootings so in comparison this was nothing. i just don't know how to feel about all of this. i'm alternating between feeling absolutely nothing, like now as i'm typing this, and complete anxiety and crying. i know i should talk to a therapist but there's none covered by insurance in my area and my old therapist was really expensive. i'll have access to a counselor for free in college but i don't know if i can live like this for the next two months if every loud noise or sound of people running makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry and with all of this shame because i feel like i shouldn't be this affected by something that wasn't really even a real threat in the end. i didn't know where else to go and i don't know what to do."

My leg impacts something hard. It's dark. Where am I? My leg! Is it broken? I scream with pain.


Wait, I'm in a bed. My daughter's room! She was sick. I was cuddling her to help her go to sleep. Where is she?! It's too dark I can't see her! Did I just kick my daughter with all my strength? No no no no no! Fuck! Where is she?!

I scream with terror.


My wife runs in. ""What happened? Is she ok? She's shaking. Stop screaming.""

She's alive. Is she ok? I hold her. She's scared out of her wits but she isn't hurt. My leg! It hurts so bad. I think something is broken. I must have kicked a wall or some furniture.

Even on good days people will look at me with a concerned look and ask me if I’m alright.  My wife knows what is going on but it is rough.  I have accept d it is time to look for some help, but I’m having the hardest time finding a therapist in Austin, TX.

I emailed a few therapists from the Blue across Blue Shield website hoping to find someone in- rework to reduce costs, and I got no response.  I message 5 therapists on psychologytoday.com and got no response. I keep browsing for more therapists but so many only have time slots from 9-5 Monday through Thursday.  Don’t most people work during that time?  How can anybody schedule regular appointments during work hours?

I’m just really frustrated. I’m going to keep looking, but this is starting to get even more frustrating.  Does anybody have any suggestions?

We had a horrible feeling that we'd know who the body on the floor was, and we did. I cant get that fucking horrific image out of my head.

606c6331471f28044865e303	2529_ptsd	"PTSD, or am I just over reacting? This might be triggering.

This is my first time posting here. I never really considered the possibility that I might have PTSD until very recently. I'm currently 31...when I was 19, I entered into my first real relationship. It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much. The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.

After, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be ""getting him excited"" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong... Basically, it was my fault. I lived with guilt, shame, and just overall disgust for a really long time. 

Ever since then, I have not been the same person. I lost trust in people....I can't enjoy sex....I'm afraid to date and fall in love....I'm afraid of men touching me.... I just avoid relationships and love all together. 

And that was just the first relationship. I don't even want to get into the second relationship, but he sexually violated me too. He purposely tampered with a condom to get me pregnant to keep me from transferring away to college. He thought that I'd decide to keep his baby and stay local with him. I aborted it and moved away of course. That was when I was maybe 22 or 23. That was the last relationship. I've been avoiding dating because I'm afraid of history repeating itself. I've been single ever since and honestly, I'm just lonely and depressed. I never spoke to a doctor about any of this. I don't know what I'd be diagnosed with but I'm afraid. 

Fast forward to now, there's a good person in my life who likes me. I think he's interested in me....I like him too but I'm still afraid. I don't know what to do or how to behave...I don't know what a good/healthy relationship is supposed to feel like. I'm just nervous all the time and its involuntary...I can't control how I feel. The new person said that I'm hard to read. Like, he doesn't know how I feel about physical touch... I'm sure he can tell that I'm nervous. I just don't want him to think that I'm not interested in him, or that I'm disgusted of him because that's not true. 

For a long time, I'd zone out...get lost in my thoughts. Oh, and nightmares. I'd have random nightmares of being attacked, violated, raped, assaulted, or just chased. Over the years I've been able to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, and that I shouldn't feel guilty or shameful. I tried practicing self love for a long time and I think it helped. I feel somewhat normal but I never really learned how to cope. 

I just need help. Or some advise....or encouragement."

5cb87813635b940017c2037a	2233_ptsd	"I think my abuser did more to me than I realize TW: Childhood sexual assault/rape When I was young, before preschool/kindergarten, I was babysat by a mormon woman. She had two children, a daughter my age and a son who was in middle/high school. The daughter was my best friend at the time and the son was mentally challenged. He would lure me into his room by playing the ""Barbie Girl"" song by Aqua, I loved Barbies. The mother would always make him take me to the bathroom, even though I knew where it was. He would touch me and force me to touch him. I still remember how cramped the space was and how he would stand in the stall with me while I went to the bathroom. I still remember how hot his penis always was. The babysitting stopped when I came home one day and told my mom that he had shoved his tongue in my mouth/down my throat. But neither of my parents knew the extent of the abuse until I was in middle school, half a state away.

Recently, I've come to the age where I should be getting a regular physical. The thought of opening my legs to anyone, let alone my female doctor, horrifies me to an extent I've never been frightened before. Even before she could explain anything, I was in tears and shaking uncontrollably. The speculum looks like a weapon to me. Even the thought of being in a hospital gown scares me. She says that I don't need to have one, but I want to have children and getting a physical is the first step to understanding my full health spectrum. I'm in therapy because I couldn't go through with the physical, and I still haven't been able to do it one year later. She won't put me out for it and only offers me ibuprofen and xanax.

Last night, even just thinking about the physical had me shaking and in tears. I curled up in a ball and closed my legs as tight as I could. Even now, typing this, I have my legs crossed tight. I think the son of my babysitter must have done more to me than just touching. I don't know how to cope with this. I'm still a virgin and have never had a real boyfriend. The last guy that tried to have sex with me was very insistent and I wasn't ready. He was disappointed and stopped talking to me when I pushed him away and accused him of only wanting me for sex. I want to have kids and I want to have sex, but I want to have them with someone I trust and love and who loves and trusts me back. I also have a horrible gag reflex and fear of blowjobs. I know that talking to my therapist is the best way to work through all of this but I have other issues that have taken precedence at the moment. I guess I just wanted to have the idea somewhere and vent a little. Thanks for allowing me to let this go into the void.

I didn't consent but at the time I felt like since he was my boyfriend it was okay. I've come to realize that it wasn't okay and I was violated. 
I have been having horrible nightmares of the incident, of him committing the act in another way, of him being in my life, of everyone dismissing that he was abusive because they liked him (which happened irl.)

Most trauma treatment is voluntary, and you need to find them on your own. I highly recommend each of you find a psychologist- not a “therapist” to treat PTSD. My trauma occurred in my childhood.

I hit the lottery when I found my psychologist. He wanted me to face my trauma last year by doing this, and I couldn’t because I knew i wasn’t ready. 2 years after starting therapy, I had the courage to do this.

I heard the conversation. I felt scared. My stomach dropped. I'm terrified for my mother. What if he is beating my mom? What if she is in danger? He knows where I live. What if he comes to get us too. I'm terrified. I feel like throwing up. What should I do? I've known him 4 years so far. I can't shake this feeling of dread. It's just her and him in the house. My father was an abusive alcoholic. This situation triggered me and I cant stop thinking about it. What if her husband is the same? Please guys I need someone to talk to.

This is my first time in a while posting in a forum about this. I was pretty badly beaten for a few years by a partner. I have monthly nightmares about him throwing things at me, cursing at me and threatening me with objects, he did much more but for some reason I usually just dream about the anger and intimidation prior to the actual acts themselves. I think because it was that stage that lasted the longest (an hour or two), it hurt me more mentally than the usual 30 seconds to a minute of when he did hurt me physically, Idk maybe easier to block out than the awful screaming and personal attacks.
I also get nightmares of the cheating and of being an inadequate woman. 

I also have noticed I tend to flinch pretty dramatically when things are thrown or tossed at me when I'm unaware. My depression and anxiety have gotten so bad and I started seeing a counselor last year, and started medication. I've gained  20-30 pounds because i just feel like it's pointless to care about my appearance half the time, my self confidence is really jacked up now. I use to be such a happy person. I always had depression and anxiety but it feels amplified now. It's like I just have a pit in my stomach all the time.

 I use to wear fun dresses and high heels. I use to go on spontaneous adventures. I use to be so carefree and trusting. I'm a fat shell of who I use to be, and it really hurts me when people bring up how fun I use to be. I don't like being unfun, but it's been so hard to dig myself out. I also have 2 young kids which doen't help either lol. I do try,  I try to self care and do what use to make me happy but it just doesn't work.

I recently started therapy and meds for depression and anxiety and it took a few visits to bring it up , I felt dismissed , she said ""he was young"". No I wasn't talking to you to fucking justify it but being on state health insurance it's hard to find good ones out of the few approved therapists in your area. 

Shit when I told my separate doctor that prescribes them that my anxiety didn't feel any better she only had 1 other med to try and then basically said if that didn't work then I just wont have an anxiety medicine that works for me. (We've only tried 2 so far). 

I just wish I wasn't like this. I wish I never went through it,  I wish I could be who I was before everything. I feel like I'll always be the victim now."	[]	[{'start': 29, 'end': 63, 'span': 'domestic violence trigger warning*', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
5cb87813635b940017c2037a	1501_counseling	Wow, you got hit with some serious stuff all at once. Work, relationships, and housing/security are major needs for us and to lose all that at once has got to affect you. When things go wrong, it is natural for us to look for blame----and the easiest person for us to blame is ourselves. Put that with grief and you've got a recipe for feeling awful. We can start feeling so low as to want to check out with things like food, and TV as you described. It can take time for us to move to self-forgiveness, and self-kindness in order to start moving forward again. I wonder what you can do right now to improve your situation? I also wonder if you may be willing to seek counseling to help you work through some of this, to help with your perspective, and to assist in your grieving process. Just reading these 3 sentences, I get the sense of you being a nice person. I hope you can show that kind of kindness to yourself in your healing.

5f7315d239bb5b04571dcbe9	1416_ptsd	"LONG DAY, LONG VENT N: niece
M: mom
s: sister 
(Sorry bout this I just got tired of typing “my niece”, “my mom”, “my sister” without using names)

TRIGGER WARNING
deadass don’t know what all I typed but I know this probably needs a trigger warning 


So today my mom drove two hours to pick me up at my house (one working car between me and my husband right now) and two hours back to her house. I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn’t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn’t. 

I mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn’t doing anything wrong. Like my mother fucking pINCHED HER ARM and held it as tight as she could when she wasn’t walking fast enough to her liking at a gas station. I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn’t until I said something that she stopped. I think it’s just because I’m an adult now and she knows she can’t scare me into shutting up when I see something shitty. 

Not even the worse part of the day? For me at least. Poor N probably is just tired of feeling like everything she does is wrong. Maybe I’m projecting. I don’t think so though. 

We were out to eat with S who I haven’t talked to in months. I texted her months ago when I was in a deep depression and basically went off on her about the dent in the back of my skull. It wasn’t a lot. We were in an argument when I was probably 16. I turned around to walk away and she grabbed a can of food and just started hitting me over and over again in the back of my head. It hurts to this day. Every time I think about it I cry. 

ANYWAY, out at dinner. First time I’ve seen in S in months. M has convinced me to try and mend the relationship. I start off by saying I’m sorry. I was immature about the way I went things and I should of just tried to talk to her about it because she’s my sister and I love her. The entire time I’m saying all this she’s looking at me like I’m the most disgusting person on the planet. I finally stop and ask if everything is okay. Honestly I don’t even remember what she said. It’s fucking cliche but it’s literally all a blur. This always happens. Whatever she said is just not even a memory. Whenever I’m in conflict of any kind I can’t remember what was said. My body like shuts down. I can barely hear my own thoughts. My vision has blurred in and out before. Lately when I’m panicking I can’t hear anything. It’s scary. I don’t know if these are symptoms. I got diagnosed with PTSD and haven’t been back to the doctor since. It’s fucking terrifying. 

I remember what I said before I walked out of the restaurant. Something shitty about her creepy ass boyfriend? (I only feel this way about him because he tried to fuck me when I was 16 and he was 20. She knew this. Is now living with him) 

I just stood at the back of the restaurant and trembled. I called my husband and just balled and asked him to pick me up. Felt like 5 minutes had passed but it’d been 20.  My mom texted me my niece was upset so I went back in because I honestly hate that she even witnessed this disfunction.  

I don’t even know anymore. I just miss my family, but I hate them. I’ve had so many traumatic experiences in my life and almost all of them (including being molested) were caused by FAMILY. It fucks with me. I was raised to believe the most important people were family but at the same time they caused me the most pain. And continue to do so."

5f7315d239bb5b04571dcbe9	2659_ptsd	"So, anyone have anything they'd like to vent about? CONTENT/TRIGGER WARNING: Detailed story of child abuse, near-death experiences, guns, animal death

I have PTSD from childhood abuse from my step-father (who I was raised to believe was my biological father) and from my mother who neglected me a lot throughout my life until I moved out.

I haven't lived with my mom and step-dad since 2011 and I still have vivid nightmares and flashbacks from my childhood.

One thing that I'd like to share with you all is a certain situation my step-dad put my family in. It was 2012, I was living with my grandparents, but went to Chuck E. Cheese with my mom, step-dad, and brother because my mom wanted me to go with them.
Everything was going okay until we left and got inside my step-dad's truck.

My step-dad has a permit to open carry a pistol, which I still have no idea how he was able to even get that gun, but then again, 'murrica. He caries that damn thing with him everywhere.

Anyways, we were all sitting in the truck, step-dad in driver's seat, mom in passenger seat, and my brother and me in the backseat. Out of the blue, my step-dad locks the doors of the vehicle and takes out his pistol. As soon as I saw him do this, I just thought to myself, ""great, we're all going to die now."" He pointed the barrel at our heads, smiling and waving his gun around like it was a toy. He almost never keeps the safety on.

""I could kill all of you right now, just put a bullet in all of your heads,"" he said, laughing, still waving the gun around.

""(S-D's name), please stop, you're scaring us!"" My mom cried.

He pointed the gun at her and told her, ""shut the fuck up!""

Then my mom said, ""this is why OP doesn't want to be around us anymore!""

My step-dad groaned and put away his pistol, claiming that my mom always has to ""ruin the fun"" and then drove me back to my grandparents' house.

About a year after he had gotten the gun (back in 2009), I was sitting in the living room watching War of the Worlds. Suddenly, he just pulled his pistol out in the living room, stood up, pointed the gun at me, and pulled the trigger. I screamed so loud and tried to cover myself up. I remember the feeling of the adrenaline rushing through my veins and feeling so helpless. Then, I heard him laugh at me and said, ""OP, stop being fucking ridiculous, the magazine's not even in!""

Well, he ended up accidentally killing his dog back in 2012. He took his sleeping pills before cleaning out his gun. The magazine was out, but there was a bullet stuck in the chamber. He accidentally pulled the trigger. It went straight through his arm chair and hit his dog in the head. She yelped slightly and tried to walk away before she slumped down and passed on. Luckily, I didn't have to witness that situation first hand (my mother had told me when I asked where the dog was when I was visiting her once).

That's not the only abusive thing that he's done, but it's been replaying in my mind ever since the school shooting in Florida.

The only ones I've told these stories to are my boyfriend, a couple trusted friends, and two therapists.

It terrifies me whenever people ask me how I feel about gun control. I feel like they will think I'm being ridiculous when I tell them I support stricter gun regulations, but honestly, if an abusive man with mental illness can LEGALLY get a firearm and threaten to shoot his family, pretend to shoot his own kid, and accidentally kill his dog with it, there should obviously be some sort of stricter regulations.

I haven't reported him. I've always been afraid to. My mom would always tell me as a child to not tell ANYONE that he abused me because she didn't want her kids taken away from her. That's still engraved in my brain, even to this day. Even the thought of reporting him gives me waves of anxiety.

He still has that gun and he still is legally allowed to open-carry. It's terrifying."	[]	[{'start': 2125, 'end': 2143, 'span': 'pulled the trigger', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]
5f7315d239bb5b04571dcbe9	1786_ptsd	"Significant other of 17.5 years has been diagnosed with PTSD for a year now due to traumatic event (he’s a civilian). I’m at a loss. Some background information. He (32 m) and I (31 f) have been together almost 18 years now. We moved to our current location after I accepted a job position about two years ago, and he had his little brother move down about four months after that. We all got really close. Flash forward to October 2018.

He and his brother work out of town, on the morning of the incident his little brother was killed right in front of him for absolutely no reason, seriously, no reason. He blames himself, has been in and out of rehab centers (he uses illicit drugs, and most recently, alcohol) to numb himself and avoid reality. Our family lives about 14 hours from us, so really it’s just him and me. 

Please understand I am not trying to portray myself as a victim. I just honestly don’t know what to do. He doesn’t want to face what happened and work through the trauma, he just tries numbing it. Everything gets taken out on me. I listen, boy do I listen, to every detail of what happened that morning. I understand it is good for him to get it out, but I am not a licensed therapist. He refuses to see a professional. Lately, his drinking has increased so much he drinks straight liquor like it’s water and I become his verbal punching bag. He blacks out every night not remembering what he said/did. It’s getting to be a lot. 

I know this isn’t him, that it’s his PTSD. I don’t want this to be the end of our relationship, but in all honesty, I’m at such a loss. It’s a lot on my shoulders to take care of everything that isn’t related to him and his PTSD and then adding that on top of my regular responsibilities. I have no support from his family, it’s kind of like an out of sight out of mind ordeal. 

Honestly, at this point, I’m just looking for some help or guidance. Like I said, I don’t want the relationship to end, and his brother wouldn’t want his death to result in the either. But there is only so much I can do to help him without him getting the actual help he needs, professional help. What am I doing wrong? Are there things I could be doing different? Is it selfish to want to put “me” first in my own life?

Sorry for the rambling. I start therapy for myself next week but it’s been a pretty rough week so far, I figured I’d try reddit as one of my last resorts. 

Thanks all."	[]	[{'start': 531, 'end': 537, 'span': 'killed', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

Been self medicating over the years, a lot of dark spots, a lot of violence, confusion and  no understanding of how I am still here.

A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn’t stand with out pain.
For the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I’d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I’d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn’t go in I’d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn’t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.
Because I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time

Iv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can’t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don’t really talk in therapy session and the reply’s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school

There’s an emotion I feel when I’m in a state sometimes, it’s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it’s like there’s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there’s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I’m experiencing and I’m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can’t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.

^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^

No one ever told me what ptsd really entails, if you cold give me a little insight, it would be appreciated.  x

I'm now married and my husband doesn't believe that PTSD is a real thing. My mother in law just thinks I'm being dramatic about all of it. Last night, I had some bad nightmares and this morning, my husband woke me up by grabbing my arm and getting in my face (new anxiety meds put me in a deep sleep). I told him to get off of me and to stop touching me multiple times and he still kept doing it. It triggered everything and just made me freak out. I ran to the bathroom to be alone but he followed me and banged on the bathroom door calling my name which made everything even more worse. When I managed to get out to take some anxiety meds, he still got in my face and would not leave me alone and eventually ended up throwing my phone at me hard and calling his mom to tell her everything. As usual, he response was that I'm being dramatic and overreacting. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the nightmares and my husband and his family not understanding what I'm going through.im tired of constantly being told I'm being dramatic.

I had a group of friends since 2004, and remained friends with them up until 2014 when I finally cut communications with them. They were a very toxic group of racist, sexist, and narcissistic people. The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. 

1. The ""leader"" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like ""You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?"". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending ""laugh"" like ""Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha."" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.
2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.
3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.
4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like ""go kill yourself no one loves you""
5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.
6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life. He was the only one I kept in more recent contact, but I noticed some of his personality traits were very similar to the group.  He would do the same mocking laugh the leader did, the same type of criticism that the leader's favorite and the white supremecist did. And at a recent party, I found out he was trying to hit on girlfriends of my friends, and made a lot of people uncomfortable. After realizing all this, I realized he is just as bad as that old group and I cut him off.

Over 5 years have passed since then, and I still think about this. I feel like I wasted so much of my potential and energy during college and feel this is part of why I'm struggling so much in the present. I think hanging out with the ""best friend"" in recent years triggered it even more, and I've been stuck in a rut for nearly a year since then.

I don't know how to find peace with this."	[]	[{'start': 1180, 'end': 1204, 'span': 'shame me on social media', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I want to be able to put the past behind me, but i cannot. I have no resources to fall onto. Being at the center and merely being at these two wrecks has impeded my ability and will to drive to the point I am almost refusing to get my driver's license. I know I'm probably saying 12 things at once and completely out of order, but my life has been fucked for four years. I think I'd watched someone die barely at 15 years old, almost died 3 years after that, my family began to fall apart with me all but cutting all ties to my brother. Fuck me. That's all I can really say. I'm sorry for just fucking amazing, but man, I just needed to vent before I popped like a brown paper bag.

It's tough enough being adopted (unless I'm reading it wrong, I think you're adopted); what you don't need is to be verbally abused by someone who's supposed to love and protect you. I don't know how old you are (past teen years though), or where your mom is, but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently. It's your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly. That's a really important part of learning how to be happy...carefully choosing who's going to be in your life. It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability). I think you're already doing that part because you don't blame yourself for his words, which is wonderful. I don't know if he's evil (although I believe evil exists), but he may be incapable of loving properly, or lacking empathy, as you suggest. A good therapist can support you in these goals. I wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult. :)"	[]	"[{'start': 587, 'end': 865, 'span': ""It's tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposed-to-be father, but it's possible...physical distance (avoid him if you don't trust you'll be treated with respect), and emotional distance (feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability)."", 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

Simply explain to your doctor the feelings you have been experiencing and how you feel that speaking with a mental health therapist would be beneficial. However,  keep in mind that you do not have to go into detail about your personal feelings. You can simply state that you are feeling down, overwhelmed, stressed, or whatever it may be. I'm sure your doctor will be glad to direct you from there. Best of luck you you!

 I'm tired of the nightmares I have of him, of freezing up when I remember how he used to look or sound or feel or smell. I'm so sick of feeling severely physically ill every day because of all this. I've had to take a lot of time off from work, spend time and money on treatment, deal with debilitating physical and emotional pain from what he's done to me. On the worst days, I'm bed ridden, I've lost weight because eating is hard on a lot of days. He fueled an eating disorder that I'm trying to recover from and it makes my lack of appetite from this stress even more complicated to deal with. 

It's unfair. I can't report him to the law, the police wouldn't be able to do anything. 

But I hope he's still truck driving. I hope when he steps on a truck one day, he gets into a one vehicle accident and no one else is harmed but him. I wish he could burn alive, trapped inside his truck and have a long, painful, horrible and awful death.

 Would it fix any of this? No. I'd still be suffering, and he still would have abused me and threw a giant wrench into my entire life. But right now he's happy and he has a bunch of friends and he gets to go have fun everyday. I'm scared of every new person that comes along because what if they're like him? I've cut contact and blocked him everywhere, but what if he still finds a way back? I can't deal with people touching me anymore. Sometimes I'll have someone at work touch me and each time it makes me feel physically sick. 

He's done all of this to me, and I'm enraged that he has gotten away with this unpunished. Everyday I find myself hoping that I'll hear that something bad has happened to him and that it will maybe be enough to make up for what he's done.

I ran up and tackled him, as we have done many other days before. We would always wrestle, have snowball fights, goof off. Today was different. 

When he got up he grab my arms and I grabbed his back ready to wrestle. Thats when I felt something hit my in the ear hard and my leg buckled. I was then throw to the sidewalk and he laid on top of me and kept hitting me with his right fist into my left cheek. I remember trying to get up and saying ""Let me get up"" but kept getting punched in the side of my face. Then the back of my head was slammed into the concrete. I was then let up. I didn't know what to do. It was me, him and one ""friend"" just watching. He looked again, smiled, and came towards me. Again, I was thrown to the ground, hit in the side of the face multiple times, and had the back of my head slammed into the concrete. 

I walked home to find a knife, any weapon, but couldn't find anything but a brick in my front yard. I walked back to scare him to try and get him to back down. I didn't ever want to hurt anyone. I dropped the brick and again I was thrown to the ground, punched repeatedly and had my head slammed. It must have been 3,4,5 times. 

I walked home with that ""friend"" and immediately cried and broke down. This day has replayed in my head freqently ever since it happened. I turned to drugs at 14. Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything. Plotted suicide. 

Its been 15 years and it has been replaying in my head ever since. I have difficultly making friends. I stay home most weekends. I feel i will never amount to anything. On the outside I look successful. I work at a great company, I go to night class to further my career, I was a successful amateur boxer, I have a great family and girlfriend. But I cannot shake this event. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living. 

I started going to therapy consistently in 2016. I have done talk therapy, cbt, EMDR, energy healing,... I am lost. I hope I can get through this but there are times I feel I will never be confident. I still binge drink and still go through depressive spells. I wonder how my life would be if this didn't happen. It has been 15 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an absolute mess of a human and trying really hard to be okay, but a bit over a week ago I was watching a TV show with a boy I'm seeing where a girl was being raped and the rapist whispers 'shhhh' over and over. I tried to block my ears and i had my eyes closed, but the scene sprung up out of nowhere so i saw about 2 seconds of it.   


Ever since then I've been a mess. I've barely been able to shower, haven't been able to clean, haven't been able to eat, I didn't sleep properly for a few days (kept waking up every half hour). A couple of nights ago half way through sex I had a flashback and I don't remember anything after that, but apparently I was crying a lot and completely non verbal for a while. I 'completely shut down' and he had to really try to get any words out of me, apparently. the next morning i had false awakenings where i was just lying in bed being spooned, then his hand comes and grabs my mouth and shoves me into the bed. i woke up in a panic and realised he was just cuddling me so i must be dreaming, but other than that i absolutely can't distinguish what i dreamt from reality. I realise i've had the same thing before - dreams where 'arms', sometimes someones, sometimes invisible arms, grab my mouth and shove me into the bed.   


I have PTSD but I don't actually know what the cause is. I can make a very good guess, but I just have symptoms and learning my triggers, with no actual solid memories. apparently once I told a friend what i thought happened while i was throwing up and crying and screaming (first ever flashback episode), but i don't have any memory of even doing that.   


There was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't. He says it never happened. Now with this false awakening, I'm worried that I've thought ill of him when it actually was just all in my head. What if it was just a false awakening.   


I haven't been able to stop crying. i have this constant feeling of terror. And i have no one around me to help. because of my ptsd i push everyone away one way or another. when something triggers me like this i can end up completely non functional. i just want a normal fucking life and a normal brain and a boyfriend. i feel like i'm never going to be able to have any of that because of what some fucking cunt decided to do to a little kid."

I've been through major trauma 8 years ago, as I was walking home from school a man attacked me. He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.
He eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.
What followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. 
I've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.
My family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). 
I couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.

I kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost. I couldn't hold memories for a while and if you ask me about my last year in high school it's pretty confusing, I just remember parts and not in order. Depression, anxiety, fear or strangers, panic attacks and dissociation would come and go. 
Sometimes I'd just not feel anything, and sometimes I'd be angry at people for not understanding me.
I started doing therapy and slowly healing but still found it hard to deal with my emotions.

Eventually, I went to this Buddhist temple and started meditating, which really helped me and brought me back to reality. I stopped having panick attacks and was able to not think about it so much.
Going to college also helped, cause it felt like a new stage of life and I quit therapy because I felt no need to keep going.

Now, I've been doing pretty well in my life and most of the time don't even think about what happened. But the other day I read on the news about a 3 year old who was sexually abused, she was found with her diaper full of blood. Just typing this makes my eyes well up.
I can't stop thinking about that, about how fucked up the world is, and keep having flashbacks of what happened to me. It's making me depressed, affecting my relationships, my sex life and daily life.
I'm living far from my family, and I don't wanna tell them what's going on because they will just feel upset and powerless.
I try to forgive myself for not doing anything like running or kicking him, or just paying more attention because I didn't even see him approach me.. 
I guess now I'm just having a mix of emotions, I don't wanna live in the past but I'm not feeling connected to the present no matter how hard I try.

I feel very lonely because the people who love me can't really understand my feelings and I know they hurt too, but in a different way. I feel helpless.
I'm not even sure this is just PTSD or something else, if there is anything I can or should do...

I cannot physically speak about it. No matter how long I sit there going through the events in my head -- I can never speak about it. Writing is fine. But I cannot speak like something is holding my mouth shut. This is causing some issues with getting things out there for therapy...

[Some background: I was raped numerous times, have gotten blackout drunk to the point I couldn't move and just lay there to try and be okay with the sexual advances, guilted, emotionally and mentally abused, manipulated, was made into the abuser somehow, etc.
This happened right after high school with an older woman (I am FTM) around 4 to 5 years ago now. I still have nightmares about being raped again or her coming back. I cannot go to some places without a panic attack happening or being extremely uncomfortable. I cannot say her name.]

When bringing it up or talking about it, I disassociate intensely and just forget what I say, forget what happened, and don't remember what happened in therapy once I come back.
I've planned on writing about events that I can remember and giving them to my therapist to read.

But is there a way or does anyone have experience or advice in keeping yourself grounded through it? Disassociating throughout my session is not helping but I can't find a way to stay."

I’ve been creating artwork and posting it on Instagram which is very out of character for me. I never use social media and my world is very small due to my ptsd. I barely leave my house and when I do, I spend most of my time with my auntie who I love. 

A lot of my art features women alone, peaceful in their bedrooms in their pajamas or without a top on. I never intended it to be sexual at all. They’re not doing sexual poses or anything, just relaxing in their room alone. It’s peaceful to me and I feel like they accept their bodies which I am trying to do myself. 

My auntie told me she doesn’t think I should be putting myself out there like that, and that it’s inappropriate. I was able to shake her comment off. Then, a week later, her boyfriend told me “with all the trauma you’ve been through, you should not be drawing topless women”.

I immediately started crying, left, and sobbed on my drive home. I feel so much shame. 

It’s not my body’a fault I was raped or abused. My body didn’t do anything wrong. 

The comments hurt me so much and made me feel so ashamed. I deleted my account and I’m really sad right now."

Texas also does not care if children are or are not in school.

&amp;#x200B;

2016: The hellhouse explodes in the middle of the night while I'm inside, catches fire, and burns down. No insurance. Bunch of animals die. Sad. Those were basically my only friends. I run away in the middle of the night and don't tell my family. Got 850 miles away. Drove from South Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, to Eastern Nebraska in two days. Stayed in my car. Stayed on the couch of someone I only knew from the internet. Rented a room in a house with strange guys from craigslist. Got screwed out of that and given the wrong date for move out. Had to leave asap. Rented a room in another house sight unseen. Hoarder lady. Cat shit in a room. No cat. Doors don't lock on the house. Random people show up and drop things off for my landlady. I have no idea who they are, they just walk in and leave shit. Can't find/afford anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

2017: Finally manage enough money for an apartment. Worked 6 days a week. Worked sick. Get apartment. Calm down. Have safe/private space. Hate Nebraska though. Feel anxious. Tornadoes in the summer. Hail every spring. Ice/snow in winter. Icy roads I'm not used to driving on. Scared of the environment all the time. Car engine dies that fall. Sink my savings into having to buy another car off craigslist. Can't afford to be without a car. Had gotten a better paying job at a call center during this year, but still struggling.

&amp;#x200B;

2018: Start trying to recover savings. That fall apartment building gets struck by lightning while I'm inside. Lightning. It also burns down. Insurance doesn't cover everything. Now in debt. God is pursuing me with fire. Reality isn't real. I am destined to die. I am being pursued. Something is after me. Why is this happening again? Brain goes to space world. Resume brief homelessness and stress of recovering after fire #2. Red cross offers no help to even transport me anywhere because I have 2 dogs. My phone is in the burned building. I have no family or friends nearby. I don't even have shoes on. Mental state falls apart. Can't take time off work long due to money. Cause problems with boss/at work due to emotional instability/unwillingness to take a schedule change. Boss says I should bring him a doctors note saying I have problems after I oversleep one day due to having a panic attack the night prior. Ignores that he gets medical insurance in this company and I don't. Tells me he thought he had been very lenient by letting me have 5 days off after the fire. Never get doctor's note. Live in fear.

&amp;#x200B;

2019: A chaotic mess. I want to leave Nebraska so bad. I am scared all the time. I am scared every time it rains/storms. I am scared every time a machine in the wall hums weirdly. I am scared when I hear sirens or alarms and sometimes mistake phone rings and stuff for them. I hallucinate smoke when I walk into rooms sometimes. I am scared when I have to drive, and terrified when it is in snow. I am scared of my bosses. I am scared of losing my job. I am scared of calling in when flashbacks and panic attacks interrupt sleep. I am scared of becoming homeless again. I am scared of wasting time feeling miserable only to die before anything gets better. I am indignant and frustrated that I cannot motivate myself to try any harder to get out of here. I am angry I do not have any parents to fall back on or ask for help or money. I am angry there is no way for me to easily get to Oregon. I am angry I feel as tired as I do and people are still mean. I am angry my job doesn't give me insurance. I am angry I make too much for assistance despite how like a stupid feral child I am, but seemingly not enough to afford consistent care. Don't want to do call center work but don't know what else to do that I can survive on. Want a hug from someone safe and somewhere to sleep."

As soon as he let me go I scoured away like a hurt puppy and started having a panic attack.  At least I think that’s what it was.  I found it hard to breath.  Each breathe was hard to catch and felt like my first after deep sea diving.  I was shaking, scared to believe this guy just hurt me.

Today that ‘panic’ feeling came back.  What started as a back and forth argument turned into him ‘playing around’ with me.  Him behind me, covered my mouth and nose and just pulled my face back and my neck was straining.  I panicked because I’m 35 weeks now and the baby started tightening in my belly.  I couldn’t really breath.  I tried pulling his hands back away from my mouth to tell him to stop but his weight pushed me down into the couch making things harder.  By the time I got him to let go he started to pat my back as I gasped for air like the first night.  He asked me if I was ok..  I was shaking and I just repeated the same words as I did before, “please just get away from me”.  

I think that was a ptsd moment - I don’t know.  But since then I can’t even stand to be in the same room as him.  He says he was playing around but I know that wasn’t a game.  I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.  That was the scariest part.  It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion. 

I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know.

For our New Year’s resolution, we decided we were going to limit our alcohol consumption. He was on board—no more drinking every night.

He was passed out on the couch when I decided to wake him up and confront him (poor timing, but I couldn't wait). I asked him if he'd come to bed with me (when he drinks, he snores and I cannot sleep—it's a dead giveaway he's been drinking). He slurred a bit and said no. I asked if he had been drinking, but he snapped and said no. I went into our room to sleep, leaving him on the couch.

At the time of diagnosis, things in my life were going great. I had decided to try Art Therapy to tap into my own creativity and learn some new techniques. At the very first meeting, the therapist asked me simple questions that started to unnerve me.

“Do you sit facing doors and windows?”
“I don’t know?”
“Look at where you are sitting.”
“Okay.”
“If that window behind you was a door, would you have sat there?”
“Absolutely not. No way. I didn’t even know there was a window there….”

Eventually, I was given my diagnosis. It was hard to breathe. I thought all my little quarks where “God-given”. Things like – I’ve never lost my car in a parking lot, no matter the circumstances – I know when an actor is wearing contacts that slightly change the color of their natural eyes – I can tell the make of most cars in the dark just by their head-lights. These are all survival tactics my brain has developed over my lifetime living with PTSD.

Why would I have this? I wasn’t in a war. I wasn’t a victim of domestic violence. This is what I associated with PTSD, at the time. My Art Therapist explained that PTSD can happen when the brain feels extremely unsafe. The situations vary with each person and their age at the time of the event.

It’s been a year since I was diagnosed and I’ve met so many people who also live with PTSD. One of them is our friend, Kim Preske. This week, she shares her vision board story of self-care and living with PTSD. The images she was drawn to manifested in a completely different and amazing way than she ever expected. Her story will inspire you to listen to your own body and trust your instincts in ways you may not realize.

66606a167e8a001a63c21f12	2180_ptsd	"""Oh hell no! It came back"" a mixture of fireworks and stress. (vent) This will be a brief account of the last few weeks and what it culminated in. Over the last couple of weeks, fireworks have been going off all over my part of town. Often, the people who are doing it set them off late at night 1 or 2 am.  My PTSD, after an incident with people throwing fireworks and a near riot, is triggered by fireworks, bright lights, loud sounds and people in a confined space. I have for the last two years kept this under wraps with a few problems along the way like zoning out or feeling rising panic in some situations, as well as some sensor issues.  


Either way, back to the fireworks in my town. With the fireworks at night, I have found that if I start my bed rutin again or get a specific fluffy blanket I can usually calm and soothe myself to sleep.  However a few days ago, just before New Year's eve as I was walking from the bus station after dropping my friends off, I noticed some kids running towards me. Thinking they were running to the bus I sidestepped out the way and kept going. Then it happened, I was close to coming round the corner and then ""bang"". A big flash of red light and sparks flew from around the corner. My first reaction was to stand still and as the last kid past me, I struggled not to grab onto him. My next reaction was to feel like crying. Which after a brief feeling of outer bodyness turned into a need for a smoke. I recently, and frustratingly, bought a packet of cigarets due to the bangs and the stress they were causing me. After that I then got back did the washing and tried to call the police non-emergency line to no avail, gave up and drank some whiskey. This obviously was a bad idea and just made me feel even worse. The follow on from that was to clean like a maniac.  


Roll on new year's eve and fireworks are everywhere, people on squares and roadsides. I was with my friend so it was a little better. At our party it seemed to miss a lot of the fireworks, We saw the new year in and crashed.  The day after new year's day, everything came crashing down. My reaction to stress was to just sleep and after I tried to get some work done I just broke down and smoked all my cigarettes. The stress and isolation this brought just hit me with a large hammer. Why was it like this? Who could I contact?. I tried contacting one of my friends and gave up. Then a feeling of needing to get out of this came about me and I got scared. I knew I had alcohol at home and that was a risk. So I ended up ringing my friend and ask them to be an accountablöity buddy for the night, as I was scared  I was going to go on a binge.   


Today, after writing this out I have eaten which was hard to do over the last few days and I have finished tidying. It feels like releasing some of this crap and meditating has helped.

66606a167e8a001a63c21f12	2333_ptsd	"Terrified of what a therapist would say to me about this all I'll leave this as a trigger warning for a few things




To keep this part quick and simple, my family life is terrible and quite terrifying, to say the least, and I'm sure this has played a very large part, but that's not quite what I'm wanting to bring up.
I don't want to call this PTSD, no, definitely not.
I feel as though this can never be on that ""level"" I suppose, in a way.
I know things like this can't be on a scale, but that's just what it feels like.
I feel like if I were to go to a therapist, I'll have my fears that this all was just me overreacting, confirmed, which isn't a bad thing you know, but just for this, I just don't know how I would react.
I'd probably feel dreadful for wasting their time, for one. 
All of this panicking and crap for what's deemed as something so small.
I don't want to call this abuse, or toxic. I can't do that because it doesn't feel like that, speaking from an emotional standpoint.
I guess I'll just say it was really bad.
Not so long ago, I broke up with a girl who i guess you could say wasn't the best.
She kind of treated me like crap, made me feel like everything was my fault.
Even looking back and knowing it wasn't, a part of me feels so guilty for something I know wasn't my doing[yet it still feels so].
She disregarded my feelings, then up and left for about three months, putting quite a bit in front of me, which I could understand at first.
You can't put everything on hold for one person, and I could understand that even at 13-14.(ive just turned 16 a few months ago)
It was online, so it's not like she could've drove near me and do anything, but that really didn't make me any less terrified everytime I saw messages of her being blatantly angry with me, being upset with soemthing I might've done wrong or said.
We never called much, which I suppose I'm thankful for, but the times we did, I guess it was okay.
I guess I was terrified of what my parents would think, given they weren't (still kind of aren't) the most supportive.
My father was upset when I came out, being that he couldn't quite accept that I'm gay.
She led me on though, and for a while.
She was really upset when I wouldn't just accept her confession and that she wanted to go out, so i guess I kind of forced myself to liking her just a bit.
It all kind of felt rushed, but I was truly in love with her, despite the fact that others would probably say it was just puppy love(I imagine for good reason).
She kind of made me think my friends were the bad ones, like she was in the right.
I gave her three chances, and I accepted her with no hesitation for every one of those.
I have flashbacks almost every day, I'm kind of terrified to do much or go anywhere near that reminds me of her.
I can't even say her name without breaking down.
I've had at least three panic attacks, one being in school to which the teacher had to escort me out and I had to go home.
This may be a bit disorganised, and I'm really sorry about that, but my brain is a bit jumbled and I guess this isn't the easiest to think and talk about.
This wouldn't be so hard if I didn't hear her, if I didn't see her in my head everytime.
The flashbacks aren't just flashbacks to me you know, they literally drag me in to a point at which I'm choking and trying to get out.
I tend to panic and not get ""out"" of it for a while, and I more often than not, dissociate from my body in a way so it seems.
I would go into depth a bit more, but I've been told that's what I do whenever I panic that way by an old therapist.
The memories aren't really in order, and I don't think I can remember specific things because they're going so fast, maybe?...
I don't think fast is the right word, but they're kind of just thrown at me all at once.
I can phsycially feel her, hear her sometimes, and being shizoafective doesn't help at all.
I'm so utterly frustrated at the fact that I'm unable to let go, but I don't think my family would deem it ""normal"" for me to say that there are memories holding me down or anything like that.
They wouldn't really understand, unfortunately.
I haven't told anyone about this but a friend who has been here from beginning to now with this whole ordeal, given my family's reaction won't be anywhere near supportive.
I'm going to a placement centre sometime soon, but I don't know when.
I'm terrified that I'm just overreacting, you know.
I'm terrified that a part of me just ""wants"" this in a way, like I deserve this.
Again, I really apologise for the mess, I'm not the most organised when it comes to my emotions and such.
She told me she was sorry and it was heavily implied that she, at the very least, attempted suicide.
How am I supposed to handle that?..
Everytime I think about it, I just think about the fact that this is just
It's nothing compared to something else so much worse.
She could've been here, you know?..
Phsycially been here, but she wasn't.
I know comparing isn't a thing of suggestion with something like this, but I have such a habit and compulsion to do exactly that.
I feel as though my problems and this is nothing whatsoever.
I feel pathetic for even being so distraught over it.
I'll probably delete this because I wouldn't want anyone finding this and making connections, if anyone I know happen to find this.
I really apologise for this though, I hope I'm not taking up anyone's important time."	[]	[{'start': 4718, 'end': 4759, 'span': 'she, at the very least, attempted suicide', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I feel like I don't even have the right language to describe it. 

- I'm spaced out at work and am lucky to get a few things done, so out of an 8-hour work day it feels like I work for one or two hours which I feel terrible about. I work off-site so I'm by myself most of the time. Dissociation or just lack of concentration?
- I'm afraid to see people at work that I know (it does happen once or twice a day) because I'm afraid they'll see how spaced out or freaked out I look. 
- I can barely handle my husband touching me, even as a hug
- Even when nothing is wrong it feels like I'm in terrible danger 
- The fight/flight/freeze part of my brain that supposed to be working in the background is constantly at the forefront, and the active thinking/listening/cognitive processing part feels like it's slowly trying to catch up. It's like my brain reversed itself.
- Things keep randomly reminding me of the trauma and then I feel upset or confused or spaced out for a while--is this a flashback or what?? Sometimes it's visual (I get a mental picture of the scary person walking down the street that lasts for a split second), sometimes it's a smell, sometimes it feels just like a memory of something bad that leaves me feeling upset?
- Last Friday I got to the point where it took every bit of energy to just not collapse on the subway, to not scream when I got startled that someone got on the subway, it felt like my legs were floating when they were firmly on the floor, everything sounded like it was distant and far away and nothing felt real.

Sometimes I’m perfectly fine, but it has triggered me before.

We heard voices in the dark, angry scouse accents shouting ""pass me the blade"" and so on, and my friends began to run. I looked back to see 12 men run out of the dark yelling carrying knives and took off after my friends. When we came to the path of the second bridge one grabbed my friend who I had overtook and went to stab him him the back. I tackled the man and my friends got away, however I was then cornered into a grassy clearing and questioned on where I was from, told they were going to drag me to the dark and kill me, and I resisted their attempts to drag me. I was thrown back onto a construction fence, the only thing separating me from the water. Before I know it I was set upon, seeing strobe light like vision as my eyes were being punched repeatedly, my legs were brown from the dirt and being kicked relentlessly, and I was dodging and diving, swinging, trying to fend for myself, when I see one run up and plant a Stanley blade into my head, just above my eyebrow. It got stuck as the assault continued and part of my cheek was cut off with a much larger knife in an attempt to slice my eye out, they talked about finishing me and argued over who should have the knife and before I know it one charged aiming for my neck. I managed to grab his wrists and twist the hand but he put it through the skin in-between my thumb and index finger. I twisted his hand the whole way and felt a crack and he fell back causing his friends to look away. I dove to go over the barrier and was sliced down the entirety of my back and ran blacking in and out, pulled the knife out my head and collapsed in my own blood. When I awoke I walked myself to the hospital, got patched up, and tried to carry on. I was 17 at the time (now 18), and for a week or two I was fine. Then came the episodes. I would teleport back to that dockyard on repeat screaming and tangling my bedsheets, put my drink down in a bar and come around over a mile away as I'd just freaked out and ran and ran, with little to no memory of these episodes. I was and am a paranoid mess, and my gentle nature has become anxious and aggressive. I can't remember if I've clocked in at work, what I learn in classes, what I ate for breakfast, and when I did go on medication was so drowsy and whacked out my mind I couldn't learn either way. I fell asleep in work, classes, I stopped taking them. I now am back to essentially square one, and have already savaged one of my attackers when I seen him in broad daylight. I moved out in November of last year to hide all this from my family, and have deadbolts on my door to lock myself away if I feel an episode coming on, and it is hell. Any advice?

The first month or so, he was in and out of the hospital. One of his visits to the ER had my sister calling to see if I could come take over for her. Her toddler was fussing and she had been with dad all day. I said yeah of course, but when I got to the hospital, I ended up having a massive panic attack. My daughter was with me and it made the panic worse because I was worried about her seeing me lose control. I called my sister and said I couldn't make it. I wasn't feeling well and to see if our Uncle was available. My daughter and I had to be driven home because I couldn't safely get behind the wheel.

Since that incident... I haven't seen or really spoken with my dad. I feel like absolute crap because of it.

To put things into context, I was diagnosed with PTSD in the spring of 2017 after my mom died in a head-on collision. My dad has been absent from my life since about the age of 13 (I'm 35 now). When he was in my life - he was less than great. I didn't realize this until speaking about my childhood with other people that pointed out that he seemed like a selfish asshole. I was a kid... I didn't know any better. It seemed normal to me.   

A lot of my PTSD seems to be seeded in guilt and what I should be doing. I've gotten used to my dad not being in my life, but he is dying and alone. He is the only parent I have left. However, I don't want to experience the death of a parent all over again. I don't think I could mentally handle it. I still haven't come to terms with my mom's death. I deal with insomnia, suicidal thoughts, major depression, and have not worked in over 2 years. 

Am I shit daughter? 

I know he is going to die, but I came to terms with him not being in my life a long time ago or so I thought...

I’m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. 
I totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn’t do anything. 
I had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn’t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don’t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.
I’m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can’t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can’t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. 
I also watched the worst accident I’ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I’d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn’t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn’t ok to drive. 
So.. yea. I don’t really know where I was going with this, I guess I’m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they’re doing better now. 
I don’t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can’t even do those things.
I’m trying so hard. I just feel like it’s pointless sometimes. 

Anyway if you read this super long post..

As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything. That worked okay for a few years, although I was really struggling mentally during that time, but then the wheels just came off at some point where I was too messed up in the brain to operate normally in society.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get these nightmares that were so bad that they wanted to use me as an experiment for a new drug that's being trialed for use by the U.S. Military. I forget what it's called but essentially it's this blood pressure medication, but when you take it you never dream again for the rest of your life. I mean these nightmares were so insane I actually thought I might be possessed by a demon and considered seeking help from a priest.

&amp;#x200B;

I would get this anxiety that got so bad that I could not turn my back to someone or all this other weird shit. I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.

&amp;#x200B;

I won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from. It was like I was being poisoned surreptitiously or something. I thought I was a tough guy but this was like physiological in nature. It made me so sick sometimes that I'd puke for days and not be able to sleep and I'd get dehydrated and have to go to the ER and get saline and a MRI.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I went to some therapist because I thought I had an anxiety disorder or something, but they were like no you got PTSD. I didn't believe it at the time, I was like ""yeah right"", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood/brain/skull/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

I got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.

&amp;#x200B;

They operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.

&amp;#x200B;

They forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some ""creative"" interrogation or whatever) they never recover. This is a concept I'm only becoming aware of now.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is with triggers. In fact, it got so bad that I had to quit my job six months ago and I've been out of work since then and barely left my house in all that time in order to avoid triggers/stimuli. Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say ""hands kill"" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people. If I trust someone enough to tell them what I've just posted here they see me as broken and crazy and want nothing to do with me. So it's kind of a lose-lose situation and I've been on my own with this for about 13 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't stay in my house forever and never go outside again so what can I do to bring myself back into the fold when I hit one of those triggers? Even when I'm doped up on tranquilizers it doesn't always fully stop the rush of memories and sensations that come flooding into my soul. I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, people of this subreddit. First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.

This is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):

A couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.

Then, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to ""listen to her point of view because she had listened to me."" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our ""conversation."" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.

At some point in this ""conversation"" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say ""No"" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said ""nice talking to you guys."" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.

In the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space/not be all the way ""there"".  

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole ""me"" in ways I have never experienced before. In any case, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support anyone might be able to offer."

I have to have water with me at all times. This was drilled into my head, while in the Navy. 

Invariably:m, The first thought to coalesce in my weary brain is this: 
""I hope I'm too tired to dream."" 
followed promptly by the thought: 
""I hope HE isn't in my dreams, again. Living through the actual event, in person, the first time was horrendous enough."" 

These are the thoughts I have almost every night, as I steel myself against whatever horrors my brain can cook up, while I'm unconscious. 

""It's just a dream."", ""This too shall pass."", ""Think happy thoughts at bedtime."", &amp; ""It's all mind-over-matter"" are the idioms spewed by those who mean well, but have no grasp of what it means to have an INCURABLE &amp; life-long mental illness brought on by trauma/ or tragedy, that causes paranoia, jealousy, distrust, night terrors, anxiety, agoraphobia, sleep paralysis, insomnia, etc. 

Go to therapy... 
Take a pill... 
Meditate... 
REPEAT... 

Do any Vets find these methods helpful? 
SOME DO, but a lot of us don't... 

""You have PTSD? You served in the military?"" 
-Yes, BUT, not all PTSD stems from having served in the military... 

""Did you even serve in combat theater?"" 
-Yes, however, I was not on the front lines. 

""If you never saw battle; how can you have PTSD?"" 
-I was stalked and harrassed for 3 years by a fellow shipmate, then I was raped by him. 
""OH."" 

I was processed out of the United States Navy, 13 years ago, on a medical discharge. 

***Honorable Discharge: but cannot reenlist*** 

I felt like a failure. 
Like a loser. 
Like I was weak and inadequate. 
I felt as though I had let my family down, disgraced them even... 

I had mental instability that I had not yet found a clear, succinct reason for. I had anger, bitterness, resentment, distrust, anxiety, depression, and so much more. 

I was overwhelmed and undiagnosed. 

Over the course of the next 7 years; I was misdiagnosed: 
-bipolar (manic-depressive)
-borderline personality disorder 
-acute generalized depression 
-chronic depression  
-obsessive compulsive disorder 
-panic disorder 
-generalized anxiety disorder 

 I was prescribed a few different medications to treat these misdiagnosed conditions.

SURPRISE! Nothing worked. 
Well... Paxil worked, but I felt lifeless... 
Zombie-ish, even. 

I myself had never even considered PTSD as a diagnosis, because: 

1) I, like so many people, thought PTSD was something WAR vets got. 
2) I'm neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist; so, I blindly figured my case was cut and dry amd that if I was diagnosed with something -- it was what I actually suffered from. 

Never in a million years would I have guessed that so many mental illnesses, developmental disorders,  (and learning disabled even) had various overlapping symptoms, that made it quite difficult for even the most knowledgeable Mental Health physicians to properly diagnose. 

Then I saw an article on Facebook about victims (I prefer the term SURVIVORS) of sexual assault/ trauma having PTSD. 

This was my AH HAH moment, and I felt giddy with anticipation of possibly being properly diagnosed; once and for all. 

I repeatedly mentioned to my Dr. ALL of the symptoms I had been experiencing, and also made a point to express concern that I might have PTSD, while trying to remain respectful of my Doctor's advice and years of study and experience in the field. 

It took a couple years BUT I was tentatively diagnosed with PTSD and my meds were replaced with an antipsychotic and a sleeping pill. 

This latest change in medicine seemed to work on my most worrisome symptoms -- HOWEVER, one of the meds made my face, arms, and hands constantly tingle while the drug was still in my system. 
Which, btw, made it difficult if not impossible to fall asleep. 

I once again went back to the Dr., my antipsychotic was changed, and I was also given an antihistamine that was supposed to help me fall asleep faster. 

The hope was to get me to fall asleep, stay asleep, and NOT have night terrors. 

While falling asleep was easier now, staying asleep was NOT, because the dreams persisted. 

I've since then added an indica/sativa marijuana blend to my medicine regime, to help with sleep. 

Some nights, I forget to smoke, and I have terrible night terrors. 

Other nights; I smoke and feel okay. On those nights, I sleep deeper and less fitfully; HOWEVER, I still have weird dreams. 

Smoking MJ has reduced the incidences of me waking up screaming and/ or crying, and shaking. 

There are still nights where I end up waking up from the vivid horrors in my dreams, and stay up, with all the lights on. 

I'm a work in progress.
