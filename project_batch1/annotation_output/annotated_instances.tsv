I called an uber and forgot to check that I didn't want to walk, so even though her neighborhood is really nice I ended up having to walk and wait on this semi sketchy big road

Uber is taking longer than expected and a man yells over that he wants to talk to me, I shake my head and he presses but I wave him off and he went away briefly. 

A few minutes pass, my uber hasn't moved (it's waiting on another pickup) and I hear the guy yell ""Miss! Miss!"" I ignore him but he starts coming to me and I get scared. He starts calling me beautiful and says he'll call me a cab and I say I have one coming and I start to call my friend because I feel like hey my chances of being murdered lessen if I'm on the phone.

He starts pleading with me to talk to him and saying he loves me and reaches his hand out and asks me to take it and I say no ans he just keeps inching closer to try and touch me. I say no again,  I'm on the phone with my friend but I don't want to talk about this guy while he's right there.

This guy starts accusing me of thinking he's dirty, and continues insisting I touch him. My uber finally comes and I cry in the car to my friend until I'm okay to hang up.

At work yesterday I thought I was okay but then I just kept having random breakdowns throughout the day. I don't have any meds for it and it's making it hard to function."	[]	[{'start': 1106, 'end': 1118, 'span': 'hone with my', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

5e77c76ddec45632bb889d42	1112_ptsd	"PTSD and digitizing childhood vhs tapes Hi, I need to talk about this because I don't have anyone I'm comfortable sharing with.

I am going to bring up a couple things that I'm struggling with and share some background so this makes sense. I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.

I realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.

**Background**

Growing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she ""made it to where I didn't have to testify"". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.

I had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by ""quickly and physically ending the disagreement"". After hearing that I got out of his car, said ""goodbye"" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for ""leaving"" them.

**The Videos**

I started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought ""Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first."" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled ""1996"" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying ""no"" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?

I was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from ""1996"" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks ""right?"" to my sister and she says something like ""only mom and dad think \_\_\_\_\_\_ is a brat."" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.

I gave myself a couple days after that footage. I was afraid I'd see something worse. I decided to watch my sisters birthday party in 1996. It was on another tape labeled ""1996"". My sister is turning 5 and we are at the local pool with some childhood friends and some family. I see my cousin and I see my childhood friend. I instantly remember inappropriate things happening with those boys. My cousin used to pretend we were ""married"" when we were around that age. He would make me go into a bathroom after our ""marriage"" and undress with him. He always locked the door. He is about 2 years older than I am. I remember feeling like it was wrong but that he was older so it must be ok. I don't remember much of what happened in the bathrooms when this stuff used to happen. I know for sure it happened in 2 places. I know I was crying at one of them and my sister was knocking on the door. It was a family vacation. He has a daughter now and she is about 5. I hate him.

My childhood friend I mentioned, he also made me take my clothes off because of what ""grown ups do when they get married"". This must have been at the same age as my cousin incident. I remember something weird he did once he made me lay on top of him, he said we had to touch nipples....then I remember his mother walked in on us. I felt instant embarrassment and guilt, but being so young, I didn't know exactly what was wrong. She never said anything or did anything. This friend is still in my life and also has a brand new daughter. They were at my wedding and so was that cousin. I feel sick thinking about this. How could his mother not have done anything!!?? I saw her face in that video too and felt even more sick. Once we were in the high school ages, we spent more time together. He talked me into cheating on my boyfriends because ""kissing isn't cheating"". He'd feel me up and I told myself it was ok because we weren't having sex. I hate myself for this.

I hate seeing these people on my video tapes and remembering these things. It makes me feel like my family isn't real. It makes me question if things really happened even though I know certain things definitely did. I continue to doubt myself and pretend I'm ok. I'm not ok. I'm having a very hard time with these new things and I feel physically sick reliving these things.

**Can having abusers in life be a pattern for some survivors?**

I have had far too many moments in my life where my innocence was taken from me or I was hurt in different ways. I was raped by an ex for years. He took photos of me after he drugged me when he took me out of the country. He was so much like my father. So many red flags and I should have ran screaming, but he was SO manipulative. He told me no one would ever love me like he loved me. He exposed me to HEP-C for years and never told me. He cheated on me. He would tell me I was overweight and that my style was boring. He told me I didn't ""do anything"". He would force me to have sex with him every day multiple times a day. I was fresh from treatment, he was sober and had been for years. I thought he was safe. He even convinced my mother he was great along with other family. He has thousands of nude photos of me from the age of 18-22. He refused to destroy them when I begged for many years. He'd always convince me to come back when I'd leave him or when he said something painfully horrible. He'd show up at my apartments while I was in college in the middle of the night yelling at me. He was a 3x felon. He was an addict and when I left for good, he started drinking again and then using drugs. No idea where he is now, but I pray it's prison. He had his 3 strikes.

I also have been in a friendship where a guy in college became obsessed with me and stalked me. I had to go to the Dean of Students because he had signed up to be in every one of my classes. This was after he had left things at my doorstep, stood outside my front door at 3am whispering my name and sending me paragraphs about how he wanted to ""practice having sex"" with me ""because we are best friends"" and he ""felt like I would give him feedback"" *WHAT THE FUCK!?* \- Guess what - the college only asked him to change classes. That's it. The Dean told me they would kick him out of the college, expel him from classes that semester or ask him to change his classes. I had to tell all my professors on my own because the college didn't have my back. He even showed up in NY when I moved after college, and I moved across the country.....I finally got rid of him when I moved from NY.

There was a guy in college who raped me because I was too drunk to drive home one night. He offered his bed and he slept on the couch until he joined me in bed later that night. I woke up and he was having sex with me. I remember he noticed I woke up and put a condom on. I was frozen. I didn't know what to do. I left when I could see the sun was coming up. I wouldn't talk to him and he acted like he didn't know what was wrong. He'd even send me texts if he was on the same bus to tell me he was behind me. I'm still confused by that.

I'm sorry I spilled this mess here. I have a lot in my head and I don't know how to get it out. I have no one to talk to. No one understands unless they've had these things happen. I'm tired of sharing with someone I feel I can share with and they tell me they don't believe me, or ghost me completely. I had began to keep it all to myself for a few years in college and now I'm busting at the seams with flashbacks and panic attacks. I had a flashback when I was skiing with my husband this year. My father did things to me once when he was teaching me to ski as a kid. I was in the trees and it all came back. I don't know how to talk to my husband about these things. He doesn't understand. He means well and he's good to me, but he will never understand what I feel and what happened to me. I've never been able to really heal from any of this and I'm just now remembering things. I feel like a pile of used, damaged crap. I'm in a new city now, and I don't have any close friends here. I feel lonely and these flashbacks have affected my social abilities. I'm always on edge and I just thought I could share on here and someone might be able to tell me I'm not crazy and that I'm not bad for what happened. I feel I am though."

In my childhood from the ages of 12-17 I repeatedly experienced sound torture by my alcoholic father and was severely emotionally neglected. I’m looking to find resources / a community to connect to. I want to know others who have experienced this and who deal with triggers etc. I may have loved with this for my entire adult life, but the diagnosis is new. With the diagnosis I want something good to come out of it rather than just feeling like a ton of bricks just hit me.

Usually comments like these I just roll my eyes at but today it became a huge trigger. My mind went back to my ex and everything he did and for the first time in 4 years since it happened I realized I was raped. I've been lying to myself, making excuses for him, rewriting the memories in my head, trying to find any way around that word. I would say ""sexual abuse"" and ""coersion"" to minimalize what happened. ""he loved me, he didn't realize what he was doing was wrong"". This morning I suddenly remember the probably hundreds of conversations I had telling him no means no and that it wasn't ok what he was doing. He acknowledged, apologized, then said I was just too irresistible and he can't control himself at all when he's turned on, it isn't him, his dick is the one in full control.

Post break up he was desperate to have his victim back. When to great lengths, more than he ever did in the almost 2 years we were together. He did something nice I was extremely grateful for then he sat himself outside my door until I let him come ""cuddle"". He swore he wouldn't try anything, he just wanted some cuddles. I had been up for 48 hrs, anxiety was at a high, I had no strength. He stayed outside begging me for an hour, keeping me awake, until I gave in. I passed out quickly to wake up to him trying to have sex with me. I pretended I was asleep and prayed for it to stop and it never did. He then kissed me on the forehead like it was a consensual thing he did. I'm still pretending to be asleep.

For years I have lied to myself on this situation. I minimalized, excused, told myself he was young and didn't know better (we were 17-18 at the time), anything to make it not happen. I've checked on his social media ever since to make sure he hasn't been dating anyone. He still tries to twist the whole relationship like he wasn't a great bf but we had some great times.

I'm married and in a healthy relationship with someone who respects my boundaries and I constantly worry he's going to do it someone else.

It's just really hard when your brain finally shows you the truth after hiding it for so long.. I remembered what he said but had warped what i told him just to make myself feel like he just didn't understand or know. But he did. He knew. He understood what he was doing. I sat and broke down countless times and he would say his magic words then repeat the cycle.

Sorry for the long ass story, I just.... It took me 2 years to admit the sexual abuse, and another 2 for this.. I'm still having a really hard time saying the word out loud because if I do it solidifies it so I guess I'm typing it out as a next best thing. Thank you for reading this, I just needed a safe place to get my thoughts out until I can see a professional today or tomorrow 

Tldr: thank you asshole that invalidated and victim blamed the 70% of women who don't report for making it click in my head that what my ex did went past sexual abuse and he raped me and he knew what he was doing."

I was living with my mom and grandparents until my father, in prison for most of my life, got out when I was in middle school.  His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom’s house, and I was so awe-stricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time.  Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs.  My mom went to prison for that and lost her café.  We live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and I was bullied because of who my parents were.  My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison. 
   My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person’s house.  My parents did not get along at this point.  We were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out.  He got out of the car, went to the driver’s side, and punched my mom in the face.  I got out and told him not to hit my mom.  At that point, I was really scared and mad that he did that, so I ran towards him to stop him.  He literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road.  I couldn't even walk.  My mom tried to help me, but he started choking her.  I hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance.  He was so badly strung out on drugs.  He went to prison again and seems to be doing well.  I met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but he's so hard to handle.  I think a lot of it is that I can't bring myself to forgive him.  My mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, I moved in with my dad’s mom (the one who lived just down the road) because I trust her, her house is stable, and she's more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents.  I also stay at my boyfriend’s a lot.  Now that my mom is out of prison, she's trying to control every aspect of my life."

Yes. That's the title. He was disgusted in taking my virginity and so he wanted a stranger to do that. I was afraid he would leave me so I did. I wrote a random Facebook friend I never met and asked him if he was interested, and we set up. But I was dumb as fuck and believed him when he told me he needed to do that without condom because it was too hard to do. He didn't cum, but as I got home and checked if it was dangerous, and discovered pre-cum, I lost my mind and for nine months straight I was terrified to have a baby even if two test told me not and even if my period was regular. I also developed vaginismus, a condition that makes sex almost impossible, and I haven't been able to have sex since (I'm 23 now) because my ex didn't support one bit and cheated on me instead. Also I'm scared to tell other guys because I fear their rejection, after knowing that sex with me would be not the sex they're used to.

5e77c76ddec45632bb889d42	928_ptsd	"I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**



**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7"" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2"" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.

Fast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  

Another episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.

I know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.

Sorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.

**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.

Without getting too into her past experiences, she was emotionally abused and made to do sexual favors, and then stalked by the human garbage. This happened about 4-5 years ago and she sill has trust issues and emotional issues because of it. I am new to relationships, I've only had one long term relationship before this for two years and it ended abruptly and suddenly. Because of that I also am insecure with relationships and I was not sure if she actually liked me for a while. She does but she has a hard time showing it, and I've accepted that because I really like her. She has a hard time expressing herself to me which is fine but a little frustrating because I don't have much of a filter and I say what I feel to her.

She refuses to get help. She won't see a therapist and she won't take medication because she doesn't want to depend on it her whole life. She saw a therapist initially but it made the anxiety and depression worse leading to a suicide attempt, so she won't try again. I keep telling her she needs to talk to someone if not me, or try meds but she won't budge. 

Also, occasionally she will get very defensive with me about seemingly very random things, which does tend to lead to fights because it makes me upset and then she gets upset because of that. What should I do when this happens? She also never apologizes for doing it, which is also a little frustrating because it makes me feel bad, like I did something to upset her(enter, insecurity). 

 All of this being said, I have a few questions.

How do I help her get help? What can I do?

Will she ever open up to me? I see glimpses of her true self every now and then but I want to know everything about her, and it's frustrating that I can't.

If anyone would like to share experiences of dating someone with ptsd I'd love to hear them. Or if you suffer from ptsd I'd love to hear firsthand about these questions or the troubles we are having. I really want to make this work and I do really like her. Besides all of this, she really Is my dream girl and I find her incredibly attractive.

Feeling anxious, rotten, emotionally unregulated, helpless and hopeless and that no one is helping me. Finally asking and begging for help only to be ridiculed by hospital staff and treated insane. 

I took my charmain hiney to the hospital in a major panic and disassociative episode last night. Can't  sleep because my sleep are nightmares, can function bc I cant sleep. Erupted in an uncontrollable rage and panic last night because of some effed up intrusive and totally unreal thoughts.

I took a Lyft bc i didn't wanna panic my boyfriend and mostly asking for help from anyone in my life or to do something about abuse has never gone well and victim blaming is a thing. You see last year my brother strangled me to unconsciousness and left me for dead. His wife absconded with their kids bc she is a nurse and didnt want to lose her job. They left me in their house to die and when my mom picked me up I was pretty beat up amd she asked me what I did....lol...All for bringing his wife home 10 minutes too late (he hates himself and her and has alway always wanted me dead bc I took everything from him...you know by not doing drugs and studying and earning scholarships for college sure seems unfair.) Cuckoo.

Sitting there, naked in a robe, zoned tf out with tears down my cheeks and a bag of piss sample, I could just see and hear nurses making rude gestures. It was empty in the ER and the only time I've ever felt unsafe for myself, i couldnt even feel safe there. I finally asked to be seen, they ignored me. They took all my belongings and phone and i just needed to call my fiance to pick me up bc i could feel a huge trigger (sweating profusely, rapid talk, hypervigilant). I said i really didn't want to be there so unless they're checking me in, ill go. A dude  nurse walks by and laughs ""good, go then""......uhm all I saw was red. That's alllllll it took for me to cuss him out, threaten litigation, speak to their head staff and demand my belongings and to tell me ""tell me how tf do you act when your brother tries to kill you and you lose the only kids youl ever have niece and nephew"". They were in the wrong and the security staff apologized as did the doctor. Doesnt matter, i wont be seeking help from the er ever again and i get to deal with the embarassment of losing my shit thinking im a victim again. Ughh.

I prob needed 72 hrs. Thats what i wanted. 

About me:  Im 37 years old and was diagnosed in 2017 with PTSD. A history of child physical and sexual abuse, extreme poverty, absentee parents , extreme bullying and racial prejudice from whites and blacks bc I am mixed, an emotionally abusive and cheating gay ex husband, watching friends die in front of me, painful endometriosis, bullying at work, physical attacks and most recently my brother tried to kill me.

Spent all of my life ignoring the effed upness of everything because being alienated or told your different sure makes you not wanna put on anything but a happy face...until my body and brain broke, which happened one night outside of a club in 2017 when a black woman threw me to the ground and choked me because i walked by her and  apparently thought I was ""just some cute lightskinned girl."" After, i went into a dissociation and been stuck in it since.

You see, i can write all those things down now but those are things no one knew of me. I am smart, educated, used to be kind, and definitely goofy/quick witted. My kindness has often been easy for manipulative people to exploit and since speaking up didnt work as a child, I just laughed about everything....the manager whos wife sent me nudes and tried to groom me for a threesome outta nowhere, the other manager who hated me because I excelled at what I did and ridiculed and alienated me from staff, the perverts who knew i was naive to men, etc...

My therapist tells me I have abandonment problems because of my trauma. That I’d rather snap at people and drive them away than be abandoned again. 

I have trouble believing most days that anyone cares about me.

Ever since I have been diagnosed with GAD and depression because of it, however, I don’t know if what I’m experiencing is PTSD. The trauma I experienced doesn’t affect me on a daily basis luckily, but if I go near the area in which it happened I experience an intense sadness and debilitating feeling of desperation and makes me cry every time. Exactly like what I felt the very time it all happened. I avoid this area entirely and will take a different route (it is near a freeway exit) but I wonder if I’ll ever get past this and be able to travel through the area without these feelings. I am seeing a therapist and am on medication for my GAD but I haven’t discussed this with her yet. Any insight would be helpful as I don’t want to say I have PTSD if I in fact do not. Thanks.

We felt like having a little bit of fun, but only took one tab each so that I could still drive and we could just cruise around all night tripping. So skip ahead some time and at this point it was around 3am. We were driving on some back roads in a country area. We felt this was a good place to stay because it wasn't populated and no one else was on the road. There was also no police that came by this area usually. We took a turn on a road and started heading down it. This was a road we haven't been on before. It was very dark, no street lights. When we turn a corner I see blinking lights from a car and then I see that the car was smashed into a tree. I was tripping balls at this point, but I felt I couldn't not go and see if anyone was hurt or not. I pull up behind the car and my girlfriend begs me to not go. She is tripping harder then me and thinks that I am going to be attacked or something and I was going to get killed. I calmed her and just reassured her I was going to check and I'll run back to the car if anything happens and to leave it on. I walk up to the car and I can smell gasoline and burnt rubber. My heart starts to beat fast as I approach the door. When I open the door I instantly felt sick. Already tripping the sight I had to just behold almost had me at my breaking point I tried not to cry. There was a mother and her daughter in the front seat. The mothers head was bashed in part of her skull had con caved into the rest of her head and there was blood dripping all over. There was a strong metallic smell. I immediately went over to the daughter to see if she was still breathing and to my horror when I checked her pulse there was none. I felt like I couldn't hold myself together. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. I began to break down and I could only say that there had been a crash on the road that we were on and I hung up and took off. By my reaction my girlfriend already knew what must have happened. What haunts me the most is that the car must have been sitting there for a long time. Just sat there maybe the girl was still alive for awhile and no one was there to help her. Maybe if someone had seen it earlier she would've lived. By the way that the blood was coagulated when I came it must have been there for at least an hour. I'll never forget this night ever.

**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it.

Our fights would start out small and next thing you know, we were screaming in the house, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg. She would lock herself in a room and try to cut herself in the middle of these fights, so I would break into the room to stop her (my mind immediately shifting to I'm not fighting with her anymore, I'm going to try and stop her and show her I love her), but she never let up. She would resort to brutally beating me in the face to get me away from her and say the most horrible things to me. She would tell me I was a loser, I was ugly, fat, and all sorts of things that I refuse to remember. I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts.

5f719ffa89c0e90009ac8f26	235_ptsd	"Hyper-vigilance in the classroom Hi there, I've been scrolling through here for a good half-hour now and I think i might be able to get some advice here.   


I don't qualify as having PTSD, but I suffer from generalized anxiety, depression, and the occasional psychotic symptoms (usually triggered by extreme stress). I'm being treated for all of these things, but my therapist mentioned hyper-vigilance and survivors guilt and I figured I'd look into it myself. My current problem is similar to descriptions of hyper-vigilance, and I thought it might be worth asking about here.

&amp;#x200B;

tw// suicide mentions, murder/suicide, gun violence, school shootings  


A little bit of background: While I was in high school, I was intensely suicidal. It was really, really bad. On top of that, every year I attended (Freshman, Sophomore, and half of my Junior year) someone died. Two were plain suicides and one was a murder/suicide, in which a gun was brought on campus. I dropped out and got my GED and it's been a few years since, and I've decided to go to community college. I really want to be able to live comfortably. I want to learn and push forward and try to find which career I'd like to pursue, and since I'm just uncertain about everything (and can't work a retail job to save my life) junior college seems right.   


As the date of my first class is getting closer, The anxiety about the situation keeps growing. I'm terrified that my hyper-vigilance is going to affect my work. In restaurants and at shows (like a friend's aerial arts performance) I cannot sit with my back to the door without either whipping around or having a panic attack. More recently it's been easier, but sometimes that's not even enough. Most classrooms are situated with student's backs to the door and if I have to keep examining the room and looking over my shoulder, I don't know what I'll do. Additionally, loud noises like objects being dropped scare the shit out of me and will throw me right into a loop if I can't quickly identify it.  


I don't know how to cope in that situation. I don't know how I'm going to cope sitting on campus between classes without freaking out about the possibility of someone coming in to hurt me. I was hoping someone might have advice here, because honestly the way that I've coped up to this point is by facing the door or having my back to a wall and watching every new person that comes in the room until my brain is satisfied.   


tl; dr: experiencing a symptom of PTSD without actual diagnosis/thinking i actually have PTSD, but am reaching out because of how one aspect of my anxiety behaves. I have a hard time coping with crowds and academic environments because I believe someone is going to hurt me (and others) and I go into a hyper-vigilant state, how could I cope with it when my usual methods won't be able to be used?

&amp;#x200B;

ofc, I won't know how any suggestions will work until school actually starts, but I've been trying to think of some ideas just to calm down the current worrying about it.

5f719ffa89c0e90009ac8f26	655_ptsd	"Online gore can destroy you. I brought this to myself. I might be the most stupid man I know.. I'm sorry, it'll be a long story.

The first thing I remember being related to this would be when I was 11. I ended up with a picture of an 18yo corpse, in midst of the most disgusting putrefaction. I'd never dared to imagine that was what was coming to me when I'll end up dead. Of course, you can imagine it traumatized me. I couldn't sleep for weeks, I was terrified of the dark and this picture haunted me, forced itself into my mind and I saw it literally everywhere.

It sounds stupid. I know. It gets worse.

I developed, what I understood way later, something called as necrophobia. I realized it when my mother died 2 years ago. I barely mourned her, or maybe I did but in a really quiet and subtle way I still do not understand. I couldn't show up to her burying. It was definitely impossible. I just said goodbye to her while she was getting medicated and ran off when they decided to euthanize her. I couldn't get to see her for the last time as something that terrifies me. I just couldn't. I can't describe it. There was no way.

Yet.. something did change. I changed.. a bit. I developed a close relationship to death. Not in a way that makes me want to join her. But a sense of morbidity and nihilism I did not know I had. 

It developed further as I wanted to confront myself. To make these flashes stop. Just like I did when I was terrified of bees. I decided to confront my fears, to watch death in front of my very eyes. To rationalize it. To be, let's say.. desensitized.

This was the poorest choice of my life. I ended up watching dozens and dozens of pictures, videos. I saw dead people. I saw dying people. Various ways. Horrendous ways. I really don't want to tell what I saw. I'm not made for this. I've never been made for this. Now I'm back to being 11. But 10x worse. I have regular flashbacks of these, each time I turn the lights off. Each time I see a violent clip in a movie or a strange music plays on. It's been months, and it stained me. It damaged me. I can't stop thinking about my mother now. What she endured. What she felt. My stomach tightens whenever it crosses my mind. I fear I might have developed PTSD.. or I maybe I dug an old one up. I feel totally lost. And it hurts so much. I feel like I brought this on myself.

As I went out to show my guy friend that joined me, I turned and walked into the wrong stall. Of course, I closed my eyes the moment I realized someone was in it and quickly closed the curtains. I apologized so much, but she clearly was upset. I understood this. I was molested and raped a lot through my childhood to teenage years. I've dealt with so much pain and agony. So for her to say I violated her tore me to shreds. I went in my stall and the episode began. Everything I went through hit me all at once, I felt it all. I wanted to die in that stall. I felt like a disgusting human being, even though I never meant to walk in on her... I left the mall and I'm now buring my pain with drugs once again.

5f719ffa89c0e90009ac8f26	778_ptsd	"Being a young mom with PTSD When I first had my daughter I was unaware I had PTSD. I had shoved my childhood abuse in a closet to never look at it again.

But after months of sleep deprivation, fixating on having to be the perfect mom and excessive paranoid thoughts of my beautiful child dying or being kidnapped I was coming undone at the seems.

My husband pushes me to go to therapy and I learned that my erratic moods, my paranoia, my insomnia... just every little thing that made my life hard was real. It wasn't just me defective, born wrong. I knew I could do something to improve my life and my daughters.

However anger is a huge problem for me and one time when my daughter was about 1.5 years old, she was being a kid. An I just lost it, I screamed at her at the top of my lungs and slammed the kitchen cupboard so hard it broke off its hinges. The second I turned around and saw my daughters scared face I broke down.

I asked myself how I could do this? What kind of mother scares her child? I held her close and I promised myself I would die before I ever let my anger scare my child again. But its not so easy, the anger comes faster than I even have time to process whats happening and it bursts out of me. When I was young I used breaking this as a way to vent it, but I can't any longer go around destroying crap, especially not in front of a 2 year old.

My solution now? Lay down on the floor. Literally as fast as I can, lay down flat on the floor, face down and take a few deep breaths. Tell myself ""you're mental illness isnt who you are"" over and over again. When my daughter stops throwing a fit, or doing whatever it is that has dried up my patience levels and sees me, I pop up and go ""peek a boo"". She then laughs and goes ""again!""

The point is... My biggest fear is my mental health causing my child to be scarred, to have a broken childhood. It feels so good to take a moment I am not emotionally in control and turn it into something she sees as so innocent. She's too young to know that mom isn't perfect. Right now she wants mommy to be her perfect hero, and God dammit I'm gonna be that for her. 

I'm still in therapy and I've taken so many huge steps towards living a better life, I haven't even started my EMDR yet but I'm hopeful. I dont know who else out there has kids, or wants them. I know I'm not the perfect parent by any means but I'm trying, for me and for her."	[]	[{'start': 99, 'end': 114, 'span': 'childhood abuse', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.

 I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.

My father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to ""discuss"" it. ""Discussion"" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining ""how things are""- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to ""misunderstand"", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a ""discussion"". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.

This was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing ""privilegies"" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and ""llike you mean it"". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.

Sometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.

I was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.

Limited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.

My friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.

I realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.

Thank you in advance &lt;3"	[]	"[{'start': 1068, 'end': 1262, 'span': ' explaining ""how things are""- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to ""misunderstand"", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over.

Recently, people keep telling me I have borderline. Which is incredibly frustrating because they're not my psychiatrist. I did bring it up with him, and he brushed it off because symptoms are similar to autism. 

They're main issue, I guess, is I am prone to anger. Part of it is my autism where I generally mask all day (act neurotypical to hide my differences further) and that puts me more on edge and prone to a meltdown. Its something I'm working on. However, I got my hands on a DSM V, and was looking at further symptoms. For PTSD it said that child abuse may lead the person to have issues with anger. I was like, ""wow, that's me!""

5eb27bd5a6c0ee1d12179563	639_ptsd	"I feel like a fake and like my PTSD is not valid. (Sexual assault trigger warning) Writing this on my phone and it's hard to tell how  much I am actually writing. Sorry if it's super long.

TL;DR History of sexual assault. I feeI like a fake because people have had it so much worse than me and yet my ptsd runs my life. Feel embarrassed by my lack of experience with men which is a consequence of PTSD.

I have struggled with this for a long time and I have avoided posting about it because I have been afraid of people confirming these feelings. I have been on medication prescribed to me for PTSD for a few years now and this has been my only way of allowing myself to feel valid. I don't tell people about my PTSD but when I have to I feel like I need to somehow slip the fact that I am medicated into the disclosure so that I will be taken seriously. When I say ""have to"" I am referring to situations such as the time I signed up for a self defense class and I needed them to know not to get on top of me in any way (will make sense later) and that I needed a female teacher. I needed to mention the PTSD for context. 

A little background: I have always had a fear of men and I can't really pinpoint when it started or why, but it was always more severe than the unfortunately common intimidation that many women tend to feel. I remember feeling this way as early as 7 or 8. I would avoid men in general. Experiences such as being cat called and followed in my early teens made it worse. 

The experience which really caused my PTSD happened just after i moved away from home for college. I was at a friends house one night and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up in the middle of the night with a guy 'friend' straddling me and giving me hickeys and trying to take off my clothing. I told him to get off me multiple times and he didn't. I curled up into a fetal position until he gave up and left. It felt like he was on top of me for hours but I'm guessing it was more like 15 or 20 minutes. Nothing more happened, he got off me and fell asleep somewhere in the apartment, but it left me anxious and depressed for months.  I felt dirty and guilty. I couldn't look men in the eyes and any romantic attention from men felt even more threatening than it did for me already, even if I knew that they were probably very nice guys. Because of this I have never had a boyfriend. Never slept with a man. The first and last time I had sexual contact with a man was when I woke up to someone who I thought I could trust sucking on my neck and putting his hand under my blanket. I am nearly 25 now. Its embarrassing to me and I am afraid that, at this point, if I manage to move past the anxiety of male attention that I will scare away any man with my lack of experience.

That was the first one. The second event, which blew everything up, was when I was jumped walking home at night. I am a runner and a lot stronger than I look as a small woman and managed to get away. It left me so traumatized, though, because I tried really hard to get help and no one would help me. The security guard at my apartment building told me to stop talking and tell the female security guard who was only going to be working 4 days later, and the police laughed at me when I described what happened. (Might sound unlikely but I was living in another country at this time and this isnt uncommon behavior there).

At this point I would physically start to shake if I was hanging out with a man and he got touchy. Panic attack symptoms minus hyperventilation. 
I would feel my body go cold and my muscles seize up. There was a situation when I was trying to get over this all and had been on a few dates with a guy. He kissed me and all was fine until he touched my thigh and I started having a panic attack. I was so embarrassed and humiliated because he immediately left the room to tell him roommates. Yes, I know, I found myself an asshole.

That left me with really unhealthy views of men (even more than before) and I genuinely believed for a very long time that men did not feel love and that any appearance of love was purely a form of manipulation. These experiences along with an unfortunate mother (who would tell me things like ""all men cheat"") caused me to be so scared to fall in love because to me that would mean being a slave. It took me a very long time to realise that men do feel love. People will probably be wondering this: my father is in my life and he is a good man. One of the most honest and loving people I know. No issues there.

Anyway, here I am years later. I have been through therapy, take antianxiety/antidepressants and have managed to cut down my PTSD meds to ""as needed"". So, Prazosin when I have nightmares, and that's all. I still get incredibly uncomfortable with men touching me and i am terrified of sex and it stops me from pursuing men I like. I am so worried that they will not be patient with me and that i am embarrassing. 

It's also hard to know when to bring this up with a man because I dont want to scare him off but at the same time I dont want him to scare me off by going at a pace I cant handle. 

To bring it back to my post title....I feel like a fraud. There are women who have been through experiences infinitely worse than mine and yet here I am complaining about it.

5eb27bd5a6c0ee1d12179563	366_ptsd	"TW: SA and self-harm/suicide mentioned—Unable to process events healthily 2 years ago I was sexually assaulted by a close friend from an extremely tight-knit group of friends at a party my freshman year at an elite music conservatory. I reported it to the school and was basically called a drunk slut unable to properly recall what happened. I left because I was in a downward spiral and was going to kill myself and was self-harming and not taking care of myself. 

I want nothing more than to move on from it all. I thought one way to move on was to help out a friend-of-a-friend who is a journalism student at my old school who was writing a report on the title ix department there. I was happy to oblige but it became all too much and one night while I was very drunk, I decided to look for some documentation he had asked for, and everything came spiraling back and I began inconsolably crying. For hours, I cried so hard that I woke up my roommate. 

The thing is, that was the first time I even approached anything close to processing my trauma. I have been in therapy since I was 15 and especially since I was assaulted, but I’ve never been able to catharize the deep, conflicting emotional hang ups I have with the friends I sorely, sorely miss; the assaulter whom I can never really escape without shutting out any person from that extremely tightly knit group of friends; the youth/naïvety/innocence I had before all of that. I just want to cry about it, but I’ve compartmentalized and can’t soberly, healthily access the emotional capacity required to let out the anguish, confusion, anger, longing, isolation, desperation, and all of the half-discernible emotions that lie in between. 

I’m not sure what I’m hoping to get out of Reddit from this but all of my friends, who *have* helped me through this, are asleep and I’m too anxious to follow suit and needed a place to vent."

My father had an ongoing joke with himself to take lewd photos of my mom bending over (especially in swim suits/underwear/nude). This was explicitly sexual in nature. Last night we found some old photos, and one of them my mom stopped and said ""No.. that's you"" when I was 6. Lewd photos of me when I was 6. I was embarrassed so I went to put my son to bed. My mom ripped it up, and hasnt spoken to me about it. I've reached out to my husband and a friend and havent gotten response, and I'm just feeling... gross? Weird? Mad that she ripped it up so she doesnt have to think about it? Completely fucked over that everyone still wants to ignore me. 

3 or 4 years ago I went through all his old shit when my grandpa was selling our old house (he bought it 15 years ago from my dad) I found a note in the attic I wrote to him when I was maybe 8, and in it I mention him leaving his digital camera in my room (also some completely brain washed garbage about how he was right and asked him not to get mad). When I found this many gross fragmented memories rushed back into my mind. Even typing it makes me want to barf.

I've been out and honest about the sexual abuse by my father for years now, and it has completely torn my family apart (what was left of it after his years of crack and heroin addiction, dropping my sister and I off in another state and leaving, etc.). His side of the family call me a liar, try to bargain with my sister to see my son, berate me, spread ugly rumors about me... I just need some support I guess. I feel ugly and weird and ashamed. It's all so convoluted, confusing, and dirty that I hate looking at it. I hate remembering it. My memories are flawed, and yet they still come rushing back. And even then I think to myself... ""you are just over reacting. They are right about you""

I dont understand how there were 3 investigations against him for child molestation, and he cant apologize, or even address it. None of his family will either.

I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. 

At 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. 

The doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said ""what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?"" I said I didn't know what was wrong. 

After they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. 

They discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a ""nasty fever"" and told me to rest for a few days.

At 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. 

Positive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.

Being septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. 

I returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). 

Now I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. 

I constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. 

Thank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest.

5eb27bd5a6c0ee1d12179563	802_ptsd	"Any advice for coping with PTSD in college? (TW: Abuse/Sexual Assault) I grew up in a very neglectful, borderline abusive household and, as a teenager ended up in a situation where I was being regularly assaulted by an acquaintance/family friend. I feared for my life (my abuser was becoming increasingly violent) and for my future (my family was refusing me access to college resources). This whole situation culminated in me leaving home at 17 and moving across the country. The year following my leaving was really hard. I didn't think that I would be able to go to college at all (where I'd gotten in, I couldn't afford it) and was struggling to support myself/with my mental health.

This year, I got a full scholarship to a wonderful school and I'm so incredibly excited! It's everything I've ever wanted, but at the same time, I think that the stress of the upcoming change (I move in three weeks) is already making my PTSD symptoms worse. I know that I'm going to be away from my significant other and my dog, who really help me to cope. Plus, I'm going to be forced to be around people a lot more. My paranoia and nightmares have been increasing, and the other night I even had a flashback, which I haven't had in a long time.

TLDR: I'm worried about dealing with PTSD and the college transition at the same time, and would really appreciate any advice or insight."

Tw: statutory rape, self harm

I've been up all night looking up my ex and his wife again. For the first time I found their Reddit handles, I read everything they've posted tonight. One small mention of me, saying he started dating her two weeks before he broke up with me.

The ten year anniversary of our breakup is coming up. This is harder than I thought. I have witnessed so much other hardy, deadly, tragic shit in those ten years--but this motherfucker is what keeps me up at night.

I was underage when we met, jesus fuck I was 14. He was 19, nearly 20. I just needed love so badly, I was willing to go along with his gross bullshit. I was not the only underage girl he dated. He cheated on me a few times before leaving me for her. I was miserable, I was obsessed with the pain. I made plans to move out of my hometown the moment I graduated. For eight months I pined, but I held on so I could get out.

Two weeks before I moved out on my own, barely 17, she messaged me. She told me all of the terrible shit he had done and that she believed in complete honesty. The night I left she tried to start a group sex situation with my friends and me. Cue a solid year of manipulation and weird moments where they tried to get me alone and have sex with me. Or she would talk to me on the phone for hours. Or she would demonize me to everyone, including my nest friend.

A few months after I turned 18 I met his double, a guy who could have followed him in a lineup. He got me pregnant, and although I had an abortion, the hormones made me lose my shit just enough to cut all of them out and take some space for myself. I voluntarily spent a year celibate from 18-19.

I've been healing ever since. I have a hard time on nights like tonight, based on his posts he seems to think he has messed up but moved on. But like, isn't he a statutory rapist? Doesn't anyone care about that? I know I didn't but I was the victim you know?

I just can't forgive, or move on. She wants kids, he wants a vasectomy. The cracks in their compatibility will widen and their toxicity will leak out eventually, even if they are happy now (to my disappointment). It only feels like that makes me feel better for a second, like having a cigarette or self harming. I feel so weak and rotten that, of all the shit I've been through, this still has a place on my top shelf of trauma."

664b66433a85063bba8cd374	246_ptsd	"Sleep Paralysis and PTSD: Unwelcome Truth Realized Hey everyone,

I was diagnosed with PTSD because I grew up in a very abusive home with drug addicts and alcoholics. My family is very twisted so I avoid them at all cost but my mother recently revealed that I ""may have been"" (her words) sexually assaulted by my uncle, who molested her. I witnessed him attempt to molest her when I was younger, so I don't doubt this.

He was a very abusive to my family (we lived with him on/off till I was 15) because he was a mean drunk and would cut phone cords and start physical fights with my grandparents and my mom. I remember he used to tie me up with duct tape and cover my mouth and would keep me in his room. I don't remember if anything happened but after my experience with sleep paralysis - I'm kind of messed up and feel like I do remember now. 

I hope I am making sense because I am on high-alert right now.

I felt my mind wake up but I couldn't move my body. I felt like something was in the room and it was trying to confine/take me with blankets. I felt it actually trying to confine me. I felt its hands touching me. At first, I thought it was little gremlins, but then I thought of my uncle, and I attempted to scream for help. I kept trying to move my body but I was stuck.

It's been 4 hours since that happened and I am terrified and I feel violated and sick. I'm not sure what is going on. But I feel alone, sad, scared, and like I don't want to try anymore. I just feel so sick and confused and like an epiphany exploded in my head. 

I don't know what I am expecting but I don't have anyone to talk to who will understand.

When I was 7 he r*ped me and I didn’t tell my parents until October of 2018...Since then all that has happened it a switch of rooms because he used to have to walk through my room to get to his. He still lives with us because he has high functioning autism and can only really work at a grocery (as he is now). My parents don’t want him to work too much or he will no longer get disability and they’re scared he’ll have a fit at work and get fired even though he’s been working there for like 2 years and been fine.
We don’t have enough money to get him an apartment. My parents don’t think he could survive on his own, so I’m stuck living with him. 
Since I told he doesn’t talk to me or look at me. I do the same towards him. This was until maybe 3 months ago when he had an outburst and screamed at me saying I’m a “junkie lair who should finish what she started and kill yourself” (I used to smoke weed and have attempted suicide before). 
He’s had an outburst like this three times now where he yells at me while I lock myself in another room. Talked to my dad about it and he said unless he sexually touches me or punches me hard (not light shoving) they aren’t going to kick him out.
A week ago I was sleeping on the couch because it’s right by my parents room and makes me feel more sleep. He then went into the living room in the middle of the night and slept in the middle of the floor.
He’s being creepy. He yells at me like once every week and half calling me a lair etc. Being in a house with him without going to school or to friends makes me feel terrible.
I would stay at a friends but my mom has severe COPD so I can’t because of the virus.
I don’t think I can do anything. I’m only allowed to leave the house for a 2 hour walk every other day. I’m unable to function well enough to get my schoolwork done. I feel terrible. I feel unloved by my parents even though I KNOW they love me, but they refuse to do anything! It makes me feel terrible! I don’t want to hurt myself but I almost want to go to a psychward so I don’t have to be here! Or run away and live under a bridge! Or something! I feel so fucking trapped.
If you read all of this please at least comment “that’s fucked up” so I know I’m not crazy for feeling so terrible because my parents are acting like it’s not big deal while also saying they believe me and it’s making me feel nuts. 
Sorry this is so long and badly written. Thank you for reading. Any advice is appreciated. Btw CPS already knows and also did nothing because they couldn’t I guess.

I've social anxiety due to that and I fear crowded places. I experience paranoia, like people looking at me, judging me and talking/thinking the worst of me. I can't talk publicly and I barely ever argue. I fear getting laughed at daily. I don't like certain touch.

i was molested by my father as an adolescent. my memory is pretty murky so i can only approximate my age--i think i was 10-13. around that same time i ending up perusing encyclopedia dramatica and similar pages a lot, looking at content that would be inappropriate for any person ever, let alone a young, hurting, isolated child. i've seen about every shock image from the 2005-2010 internet era. i've read awful stories about rape, murder, pedophilia, et cetera. i've seen awful pornography--about anything you can imagine, just barely legal. i've seen videos of people dying. and most of this i saw before high school. 

i've not told anyone about this. one of my good friends in high school was also into this stuff, but we're no longer close and i don't know if he similarly feels traumatized now or not. i am going to speak to my therapist about it next time we meet. i've only really acknowledged it as a problem to myself lately, but now that it's reared its head the emotional turmoil is very painful to bear. i am not comfortable telling my friends--only one of them even knows i was molested, and that she only knows because we were drunk and she told me she was as well. i feel sad, disgusted, ashamed, angry. i wish i could go back to my younger self and do what none of the adults that were supposed to help did--let me know that i was and am not a freak, or a monster, or a predator.

i still struggle with that now. despite not having seen this stuff for close to a decade, i still see those images sometimes when i close my eyes. i sought them out at the time, so i also feel foolish for retroactively being traumatized. most victims don't willingly waltz into the arms of trauma, but i did, countless times over several years. it's affected my sex life (or lack thereof), my self-confidence (i've seen how nasty people can be on the internet, and i always knew that i was only a hair's breadth away from being targeted myself), my ability to connect with others, blah blah.

hi, im 14 y/o and ive just realised my sister's boyfriend has been grooming me. ive talked to some people on r/SuicideWatch and r/survivorsofabuse and they were all very kind and helpful and i appreciate the time they took to warn me, a lot.

long story short, I met my sister's boyfriend when i was about 10-11. hes probably 30 right now and my sister is turning 30 soon. he has been touching me inappropriately for a long time now and it was until recently that i figured out this was wrong. he seemed like such a cool and nice guy to whom i could talk about videogames and tv shows with.

will this leave a permanent mark on me? i don't want to develop ptsd, i want to live a normal life. a few years ago when i started researching more about mental health and i came across ptsd it seemed like such a serious thing to me, which i guess it is, but i never thought id get to the point of thinking im at risk. i understand you guys can't diagnose me and im ok with that. i just want to compare my experiences to someone who has gone through the same things.

somehow this is all my fault. i did this to myself. i think it was like 2 years ago when i told him the tv in my living room had some porn channels in it. he didn't believe me so he started searching for them until he found one. we ended up watching porn together, another time i woke up before him and saw him stroking himself (he probably thought i was asleep), today he asked me if id wear lingerie after touching me on my thighs, waist and resting his head on my shoulder while playing a sexual hentai videogame. i can't help but think im the cause of this. im a teen, sexual thoughts do cross my mind but for some reason i think im the one who kickstarted the situation im in for even daring to think about anything sexual. ive never been so ashamed of myself.

664b66433a85063bba8cd374	335_ptsd	"Triggering dream (triggers are involved) Any help would be appreciated. So background, in 2012 I witnessed my stepfather kill himself.

There on after I’ve been battling my own thoughts and reoccurring episodes with many negative events in between then and now.

I’ve made many life changes, the most influential including 1 year of seeing a psychologist after being on medications, meeting my boyfriend who keeps me accountable on my actions, and maintaining a healthier life style.

So there’s a few things that keep me from going into a panic attack and recognizing that is key.

However, all my methods of coping today are not working after this dream I had. 
Writing is one of my methods, and I wrote this and I would really appreciate feedback or any insight on why I am not being able to withhold myself today.

“I’m writing this, because I am experiencing and attempting to avoid a full blown panic attack. I am stronger then my negative thoughts, and I do have the power to control them. Writing about it makes it seem less real, and it isn’t. My dream keeps playing in my head like a record and each time i get a glimpse of the record I avoid it. I avoid it as much as I can, because I am at work and I am capable of working a full time job without letting this effect me. So let’s talk about it, I dreamt that any type of thing that supported my idea of killing my self was personified. The first person was Brian, he was in the dream with the bullet hole in his brain with the gun in his left hand telling me “I did it, and you saw me do it. Why would you not want to get it over with? You are going to do it.” Then the sound of him shooting himself replayed in my head echoing. The 2nd person, wasn’t anyone I knew. It was a kid I saw hang himself on morbid reality, after the suicide I developed an almost sexual obsession with observing death. This was the first time I saw it happen on the internet, the same feeling echoed through my brain. The kid told me that it was my turn to be watched by the public. Then the video replayed in my dream with the sound of him struggling for air and finally passing. The third one was my ex husband, who was probably the worst. In the dream, he kept telling me to do it as he cut himself deeper and deeper in his arm. Then he said I’m gonna do it, all because of you too. You deserve to die, then at the end of the dream he kept holding me down to put a knife against my throat and said this is how it ends, just do it yourself.”

I am also looking into talking to someone I can somewhat relate to on this, talking to your friends about this typically doesn’t help me.

Thank you for listening."

664b66433a85063bba8cd374	1152_ptsd	"Just Found Out So yesterday was I guess what you would call a breakthrough for me in thearpy.

For the past month or so I have had a few family and friends say they think I have ptsd which I ignored heavily cause of that ""what do they know right?"" However my sister-in-law was one of them and her dad and older brother were combat vets and suffered ptsd badly so when she said it it took me off balance and I guess triggered me.

Well then Wednesday I had to follow up with my PCD on bipolar meds and we discussed how I feel like I've had set backs dealing with my depression that still persisted through the medication and even he said it sounded alot like I had ptsd.

Well I went to my normal therapist session yesterday and it felt different from the start. He was delving deeper into things I was saying more so then the content itself and finally mentioned ptsd twice which took me off guard again and got me flustered.

He caught me lying twice and I guess cornered me for lack of a better words and in a revelation or release I'm not sure which finally drove the nail home that I suffer from PTSD.

A huge chunk of the issues lays with my dad and how he was physically and mentally abusive to me, my brothers, and my mother who left when I was 2. I caught alot of the mental.

It hurt alot to finally admit it to myself and, that I felt very exposed.

Even now I still feel hypervigilant but I know where it comes from now.

My biggest worry is now that I know I'm afraid it will hurt to much and well make things worse and lead somewhere I dont wanna go to.

Sorry for the length I just felt I had to kinda tell someone or some people to I guess vent about it.

The last question is how do you guys cope with it? How do you handle or deal with your triggers now that you are aware of it? I've stayed non violent about it this whole time(alot of temper flares and screaming and yelling but no physical violence) but, I'm afraid some triggers may make.me that way now that I feel kinda vulnerable.

664b66433a85063bba8cd374	594_ptsd	"I think i cured my violent sexual trauma and ""fetish"" by getting it to happen to me again. Is this possible? Is it sick? Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it ""rape"" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.


 At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).


I hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be ""real raped, choked"" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.


2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming ""OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP"" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.


Over the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???


TL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick ""fetish"". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."

I haven't got anywhere yet, and this is tough, just trying to ventilate something.  


I'm in my early 20s, I'm a male, I live in Europe and I have a girlfriend that tries to support me.  
I am struggling today with studies, my everyday mental state and doing what I think is required of me. But I don't seem to be able to carry all of it and sometimes it comes crashing down at me. I end up crying and downwards spiraling in my thoughts. I have trouble remembering stuff, I have trouble concentrating and it doesn't feel like I will ever get to where I want to be. I'm afraid, scared and it seems that I have gotten used to the feeling of it that I don't even notice anymore. My head is failing me and it was one of my best qualities about myself.  


I grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too. We were poor, there never was a ray of sunshine because new clouds of shit always came around.   


My earliest memories is me running from home, because my mother yelled at me to do so - because my dad was going to beat her. She told me to run to my aunt and make her call the police. I remember running, but not arriving there.  


I became the quiet kid, the kid that tried to fix everything and not cause any trouble. But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  
I had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either. I remember being in school, and people were complaining about things that seemed like nothing but I never could tell anyone.  


I remember feeling so horribly sad, and I went to talk with my mother. And she was high on the pills, because she said she saw angels but it was just light flashes from the cars driving by our window. And that hurt so much.  
I was crying and she didin't take care of me.   


When I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother. Everytime they came around, they always brought problems home. Always turned to a scream-fest and me being stuck infront of my PC - hoping that they don't come here.  


I never got beaten by my dad, but my dad beat everyone else. ( I can't remember how severe it was, but I don't think that anyone got hospitalized. ) And my mom told me that I should feel glad/lucky that he never did, because I was his son.  


I finally got to meet a therapist, I cried and did what I thought was nessecary to get past this.  
But it won't let me go, I just want to be healthy and be a normal person. I want to stop crying everyday, I want to feel good enough and not being so fucking pitiful. I was so strong, I thought.  


Then I tried cannabis, and I realised that not all drugs are bad and.. It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.  


Then.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze. I took some punches, told the truth and they wanted to beat someone else now.  
 (But it backfired in two hours and they wanted to meet me and prob beat me more.)  


When I left, I was glad that I had not pissed myself or started crying. But my head was racing, I had never been so alert in my life. Adrenaline.  
I did not realise that.. That was probarly the beginning of my PTSD. I became paranoid, I moved 2 days after that.  


7 months later, I was in the military. I was not forced, but I thought it was a good idea and a nice life experience.  
2,5-3 months in, it hit me. I started flinching, I started dreaming nightmares, I became dull in my head, I once grappled with a dude and.. I became so furious, and he had to hold me because, if he had let me go earlier than he did. I maybe would have done something rash. ( I can get angry, but I -never- act on it.. I did when I was a teen, but very rarely. )  


I had to drop out, I felt that I was a failure. I came back to my country where I was born. (Neighbour country.)  
I started living with my GF and.. That is where everything turned to shit.  


I have stopped crying while writing, so that's nice. But I must have been occupied.. Less than a hour, but more than 20 minutes.   


I have forgot to mention so much. Such as, I stopped being happy after the military. My symptoms worsened.  
I did not know what was wrong with me back then, now I do.  
It felt like I was at fault, but I know now that it's just a illness or whatever you may call it.   
(English is not my primary language.)

  
I'm going to talk to a therapist again, I'm waiting for a call. (Within 10 days.)  
I try to be transparent how I feel with my GF but it's hard and sometimes I want to just fight it through without her help, because I don't want to take even more from her than she already gives me.

  
I found this sub yesterday, I was looking for a place to ventilate. I can't keep crashing and crying infront of my awesome girlfriend, I -must- get better because I don't want to lose her. (She really is the best, my gf during military cheated twice. Nice.) Anyhow, I read a post and.. The person writing felt the same way I did, I could see myself in several other posts, people who have it better or worse. And I felt glad, that I'm not crazy and you people also feel like I do.  
I know, it's f\*\*ked up but thank you for feeling like this and thank you for sharing!"

I remember the first time I tried to kill myself, it was after she got me in trouble one morning. I have this loose ceiling fan in my room. I was always a smart kid, but sometimes not in a good way. I was five, and I thought if I hang myself with my jump rope from my ceiling fan then if the jump rope breaks the fan will probably fall and kill me. My mom walked in the room and saw me tying a jump rope to my fan. She yelled at me and took the jump rope. I wasn't allowed near jump ropes for six years. Two months ago I had cut myself for the first time, because my sister lied again. I had flashbacks to all the other times she had hurt me in someway. I had a breakdown, and things have just been getting worse ever since. I've had the urge to cut again. Luckily I haven't, yet. I'm trapped in this house. I'm too young to leave, and my sister won't move out. I think I'm going to die here, so to everyone who reads this I want you to know what I've been wishing to have for a while now. I wish that I could have someone in the world to love. Not just someone who will show me they love me. I want to have someone that I can give all my love too. Someone I can hug, talk to, cook for, watch movies with, play videogames with, someone who I can be there for when ever they need me. I don't care about feeling loved, I want to make someone feel loved. Sadly I don't think that I'll ever get to do that. So to anyone who feels that they aren't loved, just know that if I could, I would be there for you. I'm sorry I can't be there, but just know that I care. I'll always care, even if I die. I won't stop trying to make my wish true even if it kills me in the process. I'll only be happy if I make someone else happy. That is my purpose.

55ba0babfdf99b09bd1bec17	743_ptsd	"Advice on medications and therapy I have been struggling for PTSD for 6 years. It's destroyed me and the personalty I used to have. I'm a very angry, paranoid, and bitter person now. I'm not who I was 10 years ago and I honestly don't think I will ever be that man again.

For the last 4 years I've been self medicating with alcohol every day to feel calm and not so keyed up and paranoid. 

I was able to quit successfully on my own, I've been sober 16 days today. Not one drink (this was not easy at all)

But I'm struggling now more then I ever have, My PTSD seems worst then I remember it being before I started drinking to manage it. 

I'm angry, paranoid, anxious, depressed, and hypervigilant to the point of near exhaustion. I just feel like giving up and going back to drinking. I feel like these feelings will never go away and I can't function like this, I either need relief by using alcohol again or I need to see a doctor. 

The problem is I'm very paranoid of people and their intentions and I do not trust doctors at all, I also am apprehensive about telling them everything (or anything for that matter) because I feel like they won't keep things between us. I can't repeat the things that cause me hurt and pain to myself, Let alone another person who does not understand what I've been though and had to do. 

Deep down I do want to get all those things off my chest but I'm afraid to talk about them. I also don't like being stigmatized as crazy or weak because I am a man. I was raised in a very conservative household and I was taught not to cry, show weakness, or talk about trivial things like how I'm feeling or how things make me feel so talking about feelings is very alien to me. I just don't know if I can tell someone I don't know or trust everything.

I've considered just going to a psychiatrist instead of a therapist so I don't have to talk about anything. 

I just want relief from these feelings. 

If anyone has combat induced PTSD, Can you give me advice on what medications to ask for?

Any advice would be great.

2014: I received heart surgery and woke up during the surgery. I didn’t think much of at the time, as I don’t recall experiencing pain but tbh the memory is pretty fuzzy now. Cue, panic attacks, debilitating anxiety, blurry vision, horrible memory, extreme hypochondria for the next 5 years. I am a shell of the person I once was. 

I am now reading up on ptsd following waking up during surgery, and I seem to fit the description. I’ve been in therapy since but not until my latest therapist was the idea of ptsd, rather than plain old anxiety discussed. I never felt anxiety the way it was typically described to me. What I feel can maybe be best described as extreme discomfort, like I want to jump out of my skin. I disassociate from the horrible sensations I am feeling. It’s so inexplicable that I have trouble even describing it to doctors which just makes things worse. 

The ssris just seem to numb me up enough to be functional but I refuse to allow this to be the rest of my life. I will fight this. I want to get better and I’ll do anything to get better.  

But who can help me? It’s not this vivid memory I have that I can trace through the trauma. Has anyone had experience with this and sought the correct treatment? I’m open to all options."

To keep a long story short, my supervisors at my work (state bureaucratic job) called me into a meeting on Friday and let me know that they were considering firing me this week once my 6 month probation period is up because, essentially, I don’t socialize enough with my co-workers. I explained to them during the meeting that my PTSD, which I’ve told them about before , saps a lot of my mental energy and I am constantly battling anxiety attacks and flashbacks, etc., throughout the workday, which is very mentally and emotionally draining, and leaves engaging in small talk with others quite difficult for me. I’ve never been rude or disrespectful to anyone at my job, and I’ve never turned in sub-par work as a result of my difficulty socializing (they agreed with this). I simply don’t engage in small talk like some of my other co-workers do. However, my supervisors did not care when I explained all of this, and said that they simply have to fill out the “objective forms” that indicate whether or not I’m qualified for the job, and that my introverted behavior makes them have reservations. I don’t know what to do at this point, but I’m feeling really mistreated, and I am about to head into this work week fully expecting it to be my last.

I avoid thinking about them, and I avoid thinking about them. And yet, I can feel they are there in my “soul”.

Not the details, just the broad strokes. I talked to old veteran buddies who were there with me. I even called to start up the therapy. But every time I talked about it, I would feel so much worse. Not only did I feel truly terrified and upset about what happened for the first time ever,  but I would feel such shame and embarrassment about everything about what I did, about not being strong enough to talk about it without having a total emotional melt-down, shame about having an emotional melt-down in front of people. And I would think to myself “is this emotional reaction even appropriate? After all when the things actually happened, my thoughts and emotions were pretty much “I wonder what’s for dinner” and then I feel guilty about being some apparent psychopath who didn’t feel anything as people were killed around him, some of them friends. All of this shit didn’t feel good to air. Instead I just felt awful afterwords in a million different ways. 

I started to “come out” then “noped” everything back into the closet. Then I was even ashamed of myself chickening out of actually dealing with it. Life is ok for me with this locked up in my mind.

I don't like going into details about this but when I was 15/16 my school friend went missing (we had a very small school, maybe 10 people per class? It was for ppl with mental health problems I had/have pretty severe depression and anxiety) it was just when we had finished secondary school so lots of us assumed she'd ran away from home. She hadn't and her body parts were later found and her step brother arrested for it.
After this I completely shut myself off from my friends, I didn't even talk to my therapist about it (I was with CAMHS) I didn't let myself be sad about it at all. Now that I'm 20 i feel like everything reminds me of it. I can't watch anything true crime/murder related without feeling weird and everything remind me of what happened. Even GoT has been a bit much with beheadings etc... And I know I could just avoid watching stuff like that completely but you'd be surprised how often murder comes up in basically any TV show. I can't deal with dissociating everytime I think about it and see something that makes me think about it. I don't know what to do, I'm already on medication for my depression /anxiety (100mg sertraline).

55ba0babfdf99b09bd1bec17	1035_ptsd	"PTSD coming in waves Im a recovering heroin addict.  I’m still at the beginning stages of dealing with PTSD, stemming from trauma related to my addiction, incarceration, and physical trauma from being hit by a car 7 or 8 years ago on my bike.  
I don’t really want to get into all the details of things that happened to me, or things I witnessed happening to people close to me.  
My reason for coming here is more about what I’m experiencing now.  
I relocated to another state 3 years ago to get treatment and I’ve been off of heroin since I left my home state.  I met my soon to be wife, had a baby and work a good job with benefits.  Everything was getting so much better.
But I left with active warrants in 3 counties and we took a flight back to one of those counties to start taking care of it.   
Pretty much the whole time we were there I was fine.  Saw the judge, explained why I left and let him know I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get this out of the way of my life.  
It went well, but I have two other counties to appear at in the near future.  Everything went better than expected. 
Since we came back home It’s like a switch was flipped and everything feels out of control.  I don’t feel safe anymore.  I don’t know what’s going to happen and I’m having a really hard time coping with the reality that I’ll probably be locked in a cage again at some point. I found myself curled up at the foot of my bed yesterday crying with my entire body convulsing as I remembered very specific events that have taken place over the last 10 years.  
I can’t sleep, I can’t handle my daughter when she cries, I keep flipping out in anger over the smallest triggers.  (Wife burned her hand on a hot plate, screamed in pain, and I flipped out.  Yelling at her and had to leave the house for a walk to cool down.). 
Anyway I’m wondering what I can do to stop myself from emotionally hurting the people I love during this time.  I’m not violent, never physically hurt anyone, but I’m so afraid of ruining the life I’ve built while I learn how to process all of this and move forward.  It’s so strange to me because right now I’m totally fine.  I can think of all the worst memories or possible outcomes and be totally willing to go through it, but my episodes have been triggered so quickly and randomly that I don’t see how I can stop myself in the moment.   
Is it normal to be able to recall memories and be fine with it one day, and then have a completely insane reaction throughout my entire body over the same thoughts another day?   
Again, I’m not worried that I’m going to do any physical damage to anybody, I just don’t want my family to see me like this and remember it for the rest of our lives together.  I don’t want to scare them or cause their own traumas and issues in life because of my inability to rationalize this.  
I have my first emdr session coming up on Thursday and I’m going back to work in the morning so I think that will help.   Mostly wondering if it’s normal to be fine one day and completely fucked the next, and what you guys have found that helps you with this."

I have PTSD from an incident that occurred 9 years ago. It debilitated me for years, and I am only now starting to get my life on track. I am also starting, very slowly, to date again. 

I had someone over tonight after being very clear that touching was totally off the table. He was totally respectful, he was very nice, and I never felt uncomfortable or pressured. I even hugged him goodbye. 

However, after he left, I was flooded with terror. I started to break down, and I almost split; I had to talk myself down from a total dissociative flashback, which I haven't had since August. 

Why??? He didn't do anything, nothing triggering happened. And it happened after he left. 

I'm sitting in bed, too afraid to smoke (I have medical marijuana for these occasions) because I'm worried it will incapacitate me and I won't be able to get away if I need to. I am so scared right now and I don't know why this is happening or what to do.

Her foster family didn't care for her either. She never had a safe childhood. i knew she was a little off when we first met, but it only started to get worse.

I'm in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. I have recently begun talking to my family again over email after avoiding contact for a year as I needed to distance myself from them. I have a great deal of trauma attached to my birth name which I no longer use and they put very little effort into understanding this and not using it when talking to or about me. I also have trauma associated with my upbringing and my family's behaviour to me as a child.

The conversations were over email and it felt as if they had begun to be more understanding of this. Recently my Mother came to visit me and after about an hour into her being here, I noticed I had begun to feel extremely nauseous, very anxious and uncomfortable, to the point where I really struggled to focus and maintain socialising for the rest of the day and for the rest of her visit. I had a really hard time falling asleep because these feelings did not subside and instead had gotten worse, leaving me up overthinking to the point of crying and feeling like I needed to throw up as if I had something stuck in my throat.

Even though they have not purposefully me any wrongdoing and that I still love them as family, I feel as if I would be putting myself through more than it is worth and more than I can deal with if I continued keeping in contact with them. I feel great deals of guilt when considering cutting them out of my life but I honestly don't know if there is a better option at this point other than doing this and seeing a therapist.

People say that you are meant to remove from your life things that are triggering for past trauma, but what do you do when this trigger is a person, especially a family member or members?

I am really stuck here, sometimes I feel as if I am being over sensitive and nasty about this, but other times I feel justified and this is the right thing to do for myself.  I can't tell if I am being unreasonable/unfair or not and would really appreciate a second opinion on this."

I've had PTSD for a while. I was assaulted as a child, by my cousin, then again at 11 by my boyfriendwho was 16, and again at 14 by a different boyfriend. I never told anyone, even my therapists, I was ""normal"" in my eyes, because until two years ago some of the incidents never resonated as an assault. I was conditioned to think they were normal things that teen girls do with or for the older men in their lives. My therapist knew though, I think. They're trained to know, especially when a young kid is edging around certain subjects like their love life or past boyfriends.

Well, a friend who knew me and my first boyfriend (the one who assaulted me at 11), has recently started hanging out with him again after years of no connection. He's apparently VERY different now, but she doesn't know that he assaulted me. She keeps pressuring me into going to their friend's house to hang out, she keeps texting me funny things he's said to her, and I woke up early this morning read a text from her about him and fell back asleep because it was early. 

I had a TERRIBLE nightmare, I woke up and didnt even remember where I was. I won't go into details, but it SEVERELY affected me. I dont know what I want to do, I want to run away and stay put. I want to cry and I want to brush it off. I dont know what to do, because i never played into the PTSD. I didnt want my siblings or parents to know, i didnt want anyone to know. I never told anyone about that diagnosis and now? I wish i had.

This same friend also dated the other boyfriend who assaulted and stalked me (for four years, as a minor, he was an adult). I'm open about the stalking, I told her when she asked me, but I never told her about the assault. We worked together and he would wait for her (she worked in the back mostly, I worked in the front of the restaurant), but he always watched me. Always did things to make me jump, like leaving so I'd be comfortable and wait for me to relax, then he'd reappear. 

I was fine until I wasn't, and it feels like today was a breaking point. I feel scared and angry. And like no one will understand. 'Why didnt I speak up before?' 'Why didnt I tell anyone?' And I'm just scared. I dont even want a hug, or someone to hold my hand, I dont want anything. I just went to my room instead of taking a hike like I wanted and started hyperventilating, I cried. Like I never have before. 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I can't find anywhere else to put it. I just wanna throw up and hide. Am I overreacting? Is this all in my head?

Anyways, best wishes all, stay safe and occupied during this stressful time."	"[{'start': 1992, 'end': 2108, 'span': "".

Hi, so last night I was given an intervention by my new boyfriend, who believes that I have PTSD from a rape that happened several years ago. 
 I have been medically diagnosed with severe depression and an anxiety attack disorder.
This diagnosis came two years after I had been raped at the age of 16 and a virgin too nonetheless. 
At the time I felt as if I had no case so I didn’t report it to my family or the police. Since the attack I’ve struggled heavily with intimacy and trust in men. 
Now I’m 20 years old, a full time university student and far away from my attack but recently I’ve started to deal with some symptoms that I wasn’t used to with my current disorders.
 I’ve started to have nightmares sometimes daily about my attack. It happened in a wooded area very similar to the woods I have to walk through to reach my bus stop for school and I cannot stop dreaming about the men in my life cornering me in those woods. 
Combined with the nightmares I’ve had several episodes of a lover touching my back during sex and I think I had what’s considered a flashback although I’m not very sure. All I know is that it terrifies me. 
My boyfriend believes that I’m struggling with PTSD symptoms due to my attack but I don’t understand why I would have them now 4 years later?? 
Is that even possible? 
I would really appreciate some insight from those who have been diagnosed and wether or not you believe my symptoms hold cause for my to get tested."

66450101a6a8f52f8b5db596	920_ptsd	"sometimes I wish I was raped Now before you start typing about how I shouldn't say that and I could never want something like that to happen to me, I want you to hear me out.

When I was little. about 6 or 7ish, something happened to me. And ever since then I still don't know if I can call it sexual assault, sexual abuse, or just a bad experience. There are several reasons I don't know what to call it. I was young but so was he. He was four hears older but I know that he knew what he was doing. But at the same time he only would have been 10 or 11 at the time. I never said no, I never said stop, and when I told him he was heavy or that something hurt or was going too far he stopped. But yet again, I was only 6 or 7 and I just thought if felt good. I remember him telling me not to tell my mom or dad, and it happened more than once. I enjoyed it at the time though, It felt good. No intercourse actually happened, but there was a lot of grinding and touching. He had me watch him ""do his thing"" and asked if I would do it too and when I said no he didn't make me.

The thing is though, I still see this person all of the time and I will for the rest of my life probably. We have never talked about it, but I don't even know if he'd remember it. This person has always been violent and has a history of abusing my parents and me physically, along with ""anger management"" classes when he was about 10 or 13, I don't really remember. That's another thing. I don't really remember all that happened, it was over ten years ago. I remember some of it but not all of it.

Now this is why I wish I had been raped. When I was in the fifth grade I started self harming. Not cutting, I hadn't even heard of that. Instead I would dig my nails into my skin and scratch until I bleed, this happened whenever I thought about what happened because I thought I did something wrong. After I told my friend (Who I'm still extremely close with to this day) about it I kind of just forgot about it every few months until when I started to hit puberty and feel sexual about anything. This was about seventh grade. I had just learned what rape was and then I remembered what happened to me and I wrote it down in my diary. The nexy day I blacked it all out with a marker.

In eighth grade I had a male teacher for homeroom who taught many of my classes. I would feel constant anxiety when he walked around the room because even the thought of him coming behind me scared me so much I was shaking. Now the weird part was he was my favorite teacher and at the time my favorite adult. So sometimes I would stay up from lunch and talk to him about anxiety and such. But at the same time, I was scared out of my mind that he was going to do something to me. Now keep in mind, this was the most innocent, sweetest teacher, nicest adult and teacher I knew at the time, and yes he was a history teacher, fulfilling the stereotype. But Even though I trusted him more than pretty much anyone at the time, I still was in a constant state of fear when he walked around the room. I thought putting myself in uncomfortable situations like seeing him during lunch would help me to trust him more and it actually did. Things got better, even though I never did tell him what had happened when I was little. in eighth grade a started to scratch myself more and a few of my friends noticed. It was on and off but by then end of the year I had stopped.

When high school started I was a nervous wreck. I was starting a new school where I didn't know anybody. So obviously, little old me began to think that the first friend I made there would be my best friends, so I told a lot of people. By a lot I mean like 7 or 8. Some of them I still talk to, but a lot of them I told because they themselves had been assaulted. So early into freshman year I had my first kiss, which led to my first make out session. Of course I freak out because there's this heavy weight on top of me and I hadn't control anything. My heart started to race and I had a hard time breathing. I was having an anxiety attack. That's when I started cutting. All of freshman year I was cutting on and off. Nowhere anyone could see though. The next few months things got better and worse all the time. One week I'd be fine and the next I'd be scared to go home because the person that did that to me would be back there. About February I had my first boyfriend. I told him about it and whenever I would start freaking out when we were doing something he would be totoally okay with it and just make sure I was okay. Truly a great guy. We broke up after about 9 months. I didn't have a lot of trouble with him sexually but when I did it was bad. We never had sex though. To this day I am still a virgin.

Now I'm a sophomore in high school and for the past few months as I've been pleasuring myself and such, I would start crying. It's not like any of the things I was doing to myself he had done to me, but I would constantly think of someone, him, another man, holding me against my will and raping me or forcing me to do things. What happened to me was not anywhere this close to extreme, and sometimes I feel like I just need to get over myself and deal with it because nothing really bad happened. But something did happen, and Sometimes I feel like it was my fault and I was in the wrong and I wasn't abused or anything and it was just kids being kids. But on the other hand I remember him knowing exactly what to do and how to make himself feel good.

I know he took advantage of me. But cutting since fifth grade and being in a constant state of fear of my eighth grade history teacher doesn't add up from what he did. It's not like he forced me to do anything. I've read so many articles, I've contacted Planned Parenthood and RAINN chatrooms asking them if I'd even been abused. They all said that's up for me to decide. Maybe it wasn't the thing that happened to me though. Maybe it was the fact that he would hit my mom my dad and me and that put the fear into my head. I don't know what caused it but I feel like I'm overreacting but I just can't help the anxiety and the tears and the thought of some man inside of me whenever I touch myself. But it just doesn't add up.

I do sometimes wish I was raped. It would make life clearer. It might cause more trauma but at least I would know it wasn't my fault. At least I would know it was assault or I would know it was abuse. at least I would have the courage to tell an adult and not have them judge me thinking that I was just some horny kid who messed around with a family member because I was such a horny child. I would know why I feel so exposed and preyed on. Because right now I have no idea why I feel this sort of... I don't even know if you can call it PTSD.

I know people who have been raped will tell me to never wish this upon myself but I really do. It might make my life harder, but I won't have to question everything I do and think to myself that I'm an attention seeker even when I never told anybody some of this information. If you still feel as though you need to tell me I'm a terrible person, go right ahead. I already feel guilty about this feeling."

I still occasionally get panic attacks and sometimes they aren’t related to the incident, the last major panic attack I had was probably very recent after the incident.  I was too prideful to admit I needed help/ therapy and lately my anxiety has been getting bad, not even relating to the accident but school, etc. 


Yesterday there was an incident in my college town that resulted in a student death. I didn’t know the student, but several of my friends did from either back home or here at school so I was pretty upset to hear the news. 

Later that night I had a dream that I was at the scene of the incident and although they weren’t really similar incidents, I think it subconsciously reminded me of my incident and I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever had, all while dreaming. It was so vivid. I think I knew I was dreaming but I still could not calm down. I woke up later, not immediately after that and was soaked in sweat. 

It was different than the usual nightmare/ being scared etc. It was like I was reliving my past trauma again for the first time. 

TL; DR - Had a dream of an event that reminded me of past trauma that I never received help for &amp; relived a similar experience leading to a massive panic attack all while dreaming but it felt the exact same as if I was awake. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Does this mean I should seek help/ therapy for unresolved trauma?

So long story short, i’ve had more smaller events of sexual abuse starting when I was 12, possibly earlier, with a very neglectful and toxic mother and family. I had a bigger trauma when I was 16 where i got dragged out of a car and let in the middle of nowhere. It wasn’t until I was 20 I got the diagnosis of PTSD (also bipolar) after years of trying to figure out what was wrong with me. I started going to therapy, but the prolonged exposure didn’t work. I didn’t want to do it, because it just made me uncomfortable. I have panic attacks and the fear and real emotions come when I don’t expect it at home, but i was never able to get any emotions out in therapy. I couldn’t even really have full memories of the main traumas. My therapist always tried to get me to cry and break down but i never could. I eventually just gave up and stopped going because i started feeling better. He was confused and thought i was running because we didn’t do any real PE work. I feel fine but my husband also thinks i’m running from it.

Here some background. My biodad is a narcissistic sociopath. He is incredibly abusive. Emotionally and mentally, and has not done anything physically but I think he would be capable of it. 

I have a chronic illness and was undiagnosed for a very long time. He thought I was lying. So he wouldn’t let me ice me joint and would tell me I was weak. Eventually I believed him. I still do to an extent. There are numerous other abusive things that would happen. 

But I never considered myself a trauma victim. I already thought “everyone else has it worse”. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I do have a therapist, but I never told him about any of the stuff with my biodad. I had convinced myself that I was over reacting and everything was fine. 

Recently, right before lockdown I met this great guy. I have issues around men (not I’m realizing it’s because my biodad always intimidated me) so I told him that before we started dating. He was really sweet about it. I explained that if he yelled I would completely break down and if we have an argument, it wouldn’t help. Our relationship has progressed and one night I was really having an awful night. 

Couldn’t sleep and I had some really bad flashback like nightmares. He called me and we chatted on the phone for a bit. After talking and me apologizing for talking about stuff. I said “I don’t get why it effects me. It’s not like I was abused. I wasn’t traumatized” and he said “I think you were. You’re having a trauma response and you deserve help. You deserve to be able to tell people. He hurt you really badly and you’re allowed to not feel okay”

And then it all kinda clicked? I realized that I was badly hurt and by not telling my therapist, I was just helping my biodad win. 

I have a FaceTime appointment with my theorist tomorrow. I’m mildly terrified. I’m so scared that he’s going to be mad at me.

Our two young kids were passengers and he was driving too close to the car in front, and too fast. I saw it coming. The car in front brakes and my ex wasn’t watching. Our car clipped the back of the car in front and rolled several times into the freeway. When the car stopped it was eerie. We were upside down and had been hit from behind. I was left in the car with our kids (3 and 9). My ex had crawled out and I turned round and was blindly feeling and calling for our kids. To cut a long story short it was an absolute miracle that any of us, never mind all of us survived.

I have since been such a nervous passenger but have done almost all of the required hours to help our kids through learning to drive. I am only just realising the absolute trauma I have experienced.

After my surgery, a hole appeared in the floor of my mouth. A surgeon came into my 6 bed bay at 2am and using local anaesthetic stitched up the floor of my mouth by a flashlight that her assistant was holding, she stabbed me through the lip (which wasn't numbed) a couple of times and the next day I found out she hadn't done it properly and still had a hole. The surgeon  wanted me to go under General and get it sorted but I was too scared and so let it heal naturally which took 3 weeks on NG tube which made me sick. I have bad veins also and was stabbed numerous times every day by people trying to find veins for canulars or to take bloods. 2 doctors gave me a nose bleed because they were trying to very forcefully shove a large NG tube that was the wrong size up my nose. My dietician  restricted my water and I had severe dehydration headaches all weekend while she was off and no one would up my water intake because her word is law or whatever. Anyway long story short, it was a lash up and lots of horrible things happened to me along with just trying to deal with getting cancer and going through treatment. So since then I have nightmares every night, I can't sleep, I grind my teeth all day getting angry at how (I've tried) but can't get any help for what happened to me and psychological help. So it didn't really click until I went for an eye test and they did the glaucoma air pressure test and I completely broke down. I was so embarrassed because the lady doing it clearly didn't get it, it's only a burst of air to the eye, it doesn't hurt. Which I get. But to me, it was another test, another thing being done to me in a kind of medical setting and I just couldn't handle it and lost my shit.

I have panic attacks and the fear and real emotions come when I don’t expect it at home, but i was never able to get any emotions out in therapy. I couldn’t even really have full memories of the main traumas. My therapist always tried to get me to cry and break down but i never could. I eventually just gave up and stopped going because i started feeling better. He was confused and thought i was running because we didn’t do any real PE work.

Anything sexual that shows up in conversation or on TV makes her cry and scream. I cant tell you the amount of nightmares she has had in the past. She believes that sexually-active parents don't love their children and that if a child died, the parents would just have a sex party on that child's corpse. that terrifies me. that is far from normal. that is demented thinking. i am pregnant myself, and as a woman who is *very* sexually active, i can tell you that that child is my number one priority and that even though I haven't met him yet, my boyfriend and I would give our lives up just so he can live happy. i'm afraid to have sex with my boyfriend because she's almost always here, and if she even hears us having sex, i don't know what she'll do. she was given to a foster care in sixth grade and her parents were put in prison for fifteen years for child abandonment and sexual abuse involving a child. Her foster family didn't care for her either. She never had a safe childhood. i knew she was a little off when we first met, but it only started to get worse. We tried therapy, medical marijuana, and she's currently on medication that i have to keep because i'm afraid she'll overdose.

5a89afc90f1bce00012242d8	227_ptsd	"I reflexively calmed down after my anger flared up for the first time today. TW: violence

For almost 3 years now I've been struggling with a PTSD that I got from being assaulted in public twice in a row in the span of 2 months. Since this was pretty public and the public was very apathetic to it it caused me to feel very worthless. I felt a lot of resentment for other people. Since then I've had anger issues. I got pretty good at hiding this though. 

&amp;#x200B;

In these last 3 years violence has played a big part in my routine mental thought. If I was mad at someone, even for the slightest smallest ""infractions"" towards me, I would fantasize about hurting them in some way. Life was mostly good, but I'd spent hours pacing around my apartment thinking about how people had ""crossed"" me that day, and how they were going to pay for it. It is really scary stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Until today I always had to put in concious effort to stop when I caught myself having these involuntary fantasies. But today, for the first time, I caught myself in a fantasy and reflexively got myself out of it. It almost feels like my body finally realizes that I don't actually live a violent life, and that I can tackle my problems in other, healthier ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned to function with my PTSD for a long time now (therapy yay!), but this feels like the biggest step towards recovery yet. I really hope this trend continues, because sometimes I'm still afraid that one day I might slip up, and do something that I would regret. Luckily that hasn't happened yet, and things seem to get easier with time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you folks ever felt like they where ""stuck"" in a violent state of mind? How do you guys cope with it?  Are you guys hopeful for a full recovery or do you believe that PTSD is something you have to learn to live with?

I lost seven teeth, crushed the right side of my face and broke my left humerus. While it's not ideal, I've accepted this moment in my life and the results of it. In a roundabout way, it's lead to one of my best friends meeting his now-fiancee and put me on a positive direction in life as opposed to bouncing around from job to job.

Over the past couple of years I dealt with roughly one dream a week reliving the experience and waking up in a panic. For the past year I've been going to a rock climbing gym and the dreams have largely stopped. I still avoid ladders and other heights, but I'm comfortable on the rock wall. I'm not as daring as others there, and it really limits the difficulty of climbs I can complete because I don't put myself out there as much as I could to make the more difficult moves. Sometimes I fall, but it's generally expected. Or I jump off because I'm worn out. 

Today I had an unexpected fall. It was only from about 7ft, but my foot slipped, just like it did in my accident. I hit the ground awkwardly, but unhurt and didn't stop shaking for an hour. I was on the verge of tears as I left the gym and bought a pack of cigarettes (I've been on an ecig for a few months). To top it off, I had to go in for a work meeting where the manager tore into us for the general decline in standards that's occurred lately, which is a whole other story.

I don't know what to do. I'm still on edge, and I don't want to sleep because I know I'll have a dream where I fall, or I lose my teeth, or crush my face or something. I was doing so well, and I know it's just a bad day, but I'm terrified that this step back will have more of an impact. I just need someone who's been here before to tell me something that helps."

Am I just a crybaby or something... I spoke on abuse support group about my feelings and a woman attacked me, told me I was nasty and I brought other people down to feel good. It was evident I didn’t do that in the post (I mentioned my ex cheating with sex worker and she took offence to the fact I mentioned her occupation, I wrote no opinion on it, just mentioned it whilst focusing on my pain).

5a89afc90f1bce00012242d8	838_ptsd	A night that still haunts me So me and my girlfriend had decided to take acid around 5pm one night. We felt like having a little bit of fun, but only took one tab each so that I could still drive and we could just cruise around all night tripping. So skip ahead some time and at this point it was around 3am. We were driving on some back roads in a country area. We felt this was a good place to stay because it wasn't populated and no one else was on the road. There was also no police that came by this area usually. We took a turn on a road and started heading down it. This was a road we haven't been on before. It was very dark, no street lights. When we turn a corner I see blinking lights from a car and then I see that the car was smashed into a tree. I was tripping balls at this point, but I felt I couldn't not go and see if anyone was hurt or not. I pull up behind the car and my girlfriend begs me to not go. She is tripping harder then me and thinks that I am going to be attacked or something and I was going to get killed. I calmed her and just reassured her I was going to check and I'll run back to the car if anything happens and to leave it on. I walk up to the car and I can smell gasoline and burnt rubber. My heart starts to beat fast as I approach the door. When I open the door I instantly felt sick. Already tripping the sight I had to just behold almost had me at my breaking point I tried not to cry. There was a mother and her daughter in the front seat. The mothers head was bashed in part of her skull had con caved into the rest of her head and there was blood dripping all over. There was a strong metallic smell. I immediately went over to the daughter to see if she was still breathing and to my horror when I checked her pulse there was none. I felt like I couldn't hold myself together. I grabbed my phone and dialed 911. I began to break down and I could only say that there had been a crash on the road that we were on and I hung up and took off. By my reaction my girlfriend already knew what must have happened. What haunts me the most is that the car must have been sitting there for a long time. Just sat there maybe the girl was still alive for awhile and no one was there to help her. Maybe if someone had seen it earlier she would've lived. By the way that the blood was coagulated when I came it must have been there for at least an hour. I'll never forget this night ever.

5a89afc90f1bce00012242d8	444_ptsd	"Questioning I’ve never been diagnosed with ptsd but I’m wondering if it’s possible I could have it...

I’ve been dealing with pretty bad emotional manipulation/abuse since I was a child (22 years of it) and recently had a very bad run in with my aunt where she cornered me. I don’t want to get into details too much (it triggers me), but it was a lot of the usual stuff (my father and his side of the family blame my mom and myself for the lack of relationship with them when they’ve never tried to have one at all, I can never do anything right, etc...). This also led to her talking to some people who are pretty important to me and getting them successfully on her side. 

None of this came with any threat of harm, the most she did was grab me (literally) and pull me into a hug. But I have depression, anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, and ocd and just her cornering me sent everything off the walls. I was suicidal that night, numerous panic attacks, etc... lots of fun.

I don’t know if any of this would be enough to trigger ptsd or not, but I feel like I have it(??)

I keep getting definite flashbacks (mostly auditory, but sometimes it feels like a bad movie I can’t turn off) (these also come with terrible headaches), I dissociate bad when things that remind me of this whole mess are even brought up, I have been having the worst panic attacks of my life when something that reminds of this is brought up, I’ve been having terrible nightmares related to this, I can’t go or even think about going near where it happened without shutting down, I have changed my number to prevent them from contacting me because they were trying to... I could go on for hours...

I’m a mess and it’s only been getting worse. Would this situation causing me to feel so intensely suicidal and continuing to bring up those feelings for months now (this has been dragged on for close to 4 months at this point) be enough to tip me over?? I feel like it doesn’t qualify trauma wise but I feel like I have every other symptom in the book...

However, I'm studying abroad in france for this semester and I'm about to run out of this medication, and I cant get anyone to prescribe me a medication I feel comfortable taking, so I may just have to go off my meds. In france it seems that doctors just automatically want to give you xanex for anything anxiety related, obviously I dont think theres anything wrong with taking Xanex in general, if it helps someone thats great but since I have been taking a non-addictive medication in the states that has worked wonders, and my US doctor has made it clear she doesn't like prescribing Xanex unless nothing else works I'm incredibly uncomfortable with it. I have now been going to doctors appointments for a month now trying to get something I can take (I've taken SSRI's before, and while they still leave me with way too many mental illness symptoms, the worst of them are gone), and of the 5 different doctors appointments I've had all have been really against prescribing me anything other than  Xanex. Im honestly just so scared, the last time I went off medications I failed every assignment I had during that time period, and spent almost every second of my day in bed feeling like crap, and this time, since I'm abroad I don't even have friends that I can reach out to in person, just through text for the second half of the day, thanks to the time difference. I've already noticed my mental health getting significantly worse just from the stressed cause by all this. I'm just so worried, and I know the worry is just going to make everything worse, because even though i'm medicated right now its making me miserable, so I'm going to crash fast and of course I'm going to dun out right in the middle of midterm week. Anyways thanks for reading all this, I just needed to get it out somewhere and I didn't know where else to go.

We found out later that there was no actual threat in the school, but I thought there was. I spent an hour and a half huddled up in my creative writing classroom fearing for my life, having no idea what was going on, having reason to believe someone was in the school with a gun or a knife or something. I was 11 years old and mentally preparing myself to be murdered. I wasn't though. No one was remotely physically hurt in anyway. There wasn't actually a shooting or anything. We just thought there was. I thought there was. No one understands that. They all think ""well nothing actually happened, it couldn't have been that scary"" or ""you can't really have PTSD from that"". No one understands how much being in that situation really hurts. I often say ""silence is scarier than gunshots"". I almost wish I could hear an attacker, then at least I would have some idea of what was going on.

I have PTSD and anxiety and have been working with my Therapist to not only set boundaries but also put myself first (I tend to put others before my needs and burn out). Boy is it hard. 

I  had a rough month last month. Got hired on into a new job, Dad was diagnosed with cancer and had surgery. Fiancé went through issues that triggered his anxiety and on top of all of that I’m working on healing from my trauma and all the spin offs from it (I’m a assault survivor and the anniversary just happened).  I’m going through some of the darker parts of what happened in therapy and it’s draining on me. 

Also add that my mom leans on me for support and I had to talk her down from anxiety in relation to my dad while trying to deal with my own pain and emotions from it.

Rough month right? 

I finally hit a wall, I just needed a break.  I had to be strong with all that was going on and it hit me hard.  And yesterday I felt that straw break.  

In the middle of all the craziness that was happening at work yesterday, my mom calls me...my step grandmother has cancer (bone) and I just couldn’t. I didn’t want to hear it at that time.  I had shut down. 

I couldn’t provide the logic my mom wanted to hear. She didn’t even listen to me when I asked her to stop. She just kept going on and on about what cancer it was and what may happen next and how everyone is upset.  I actually snapped and yelled stop. I told her I could not process right now and that I need a break. I asked to let me had the night and we can talk about it the next day.  

Her response was to tell me that “I could just find out about it myself” and hung up on me. 

I’m angry, hurt and shutting down, please tell me others have felt this way too.

When I was 14 my friend was beaten so badly he died of complications relating to brain trauma a few days later. I was sat next to him. I got dragged through a murder trial. Never once did I cry about it. Turning to drugs, drink, petty theft and violence almost immediately after. My mother I suspect is a covert narcissist and my father an emotional black hole. The whole thing got brushed aside while I started to burn my life.

My previous job had me on call 24/7 for a little over 3 years. It was in the medical field, and if a patient or nurse called me any time, day or night, I had to respond to the call. I would work my 9+ regular hours at the office or in the field, and then several more hours a day after hours on call, not to mention every weekend.. It was a good job, but I absolutely hated that part of it. It caused me to lose a lot of friends and put a lot of hardship between me and my family because I was ALWAYS at work.

Anyway, about 2 months ago I decided that I needed to leave that job for my own mental well-being. I should note that I had always kept the standard AT&amp;T ringtone on my phone. After my last day, I changed my phone number, ringtone, etc. I needed to be free. Since leaving, I have noticed that almost everyone has that ringtone. When I'm out shopping or at a restaurant and someone's phone rings with that ringtone, an almost overwhelming amount of anxiety washes over me to the point that I almost feel sick at my stomach. After 10 minutes or so, and as quickly as I can distract myself with something else, it's mostly gone but I still feel ""off"" for a while. I even still hear ""phantom"" ringing a lot, where I will be alone and think my phone is ringing but it isn't. Typing this all out makes me feel like I'm crazy or something. Is this PTSD or something else, and if so, how can I get over it?"

5ed934569883864994ac0b97	750_ptsd	"I don't know if I actually have ptsd TW: Sexual Trauma, suicide

I had what i think are repressed memories that came back about two years ago. I feel like i cant talk about my trauma, because i don't even know if it actually happened, or if my mind just made it up.

I've had a ridiculously high sex drive since late middle school for seemingly no reason, i was obsessed and so lost in fantasies (nothing immoral) that my grades fell. Im trans and poly, like so aggressively poly i have trouble with monogamous relationships. I have diagnosed chemical depression and general anxiety disorders but i thought it was common, especially in high school. I went to therapy but they would always try to figure out ""the real reason"" i was depressed, as though my litte sister passing wasn't enough. I attempted suicide several times, but nobody knew.

I had a sexual relationship with an ex my sophomore year. A few months after we started having sex, i started dissociating and having flashbacks of things i didn't remember, followed by panic attacks. I had had lots of negative sexual encounters (like regret or harassment; i often got my ass slapped in middle school hallways and thought it was a good thing until i was older) which, sadly, lots of afab people do, but i didn't remember any assault. 

I still have the flashbacks, though not as often or aggressively. Some positions or certain phrases trigger it, sometimes it's just the act, sometimes it's because someone angrily kicked their backpack in the hall or raised their voice. I usually have to stop whatever sexual thing I'm doing and often don't do anything else sex-wise for several days, but i can occasionally force it out of my head and continue. I still have an elevated sex drive but not as crazy as before i started getting them. I still have problems with monogamy.

I wonder if the sex drive and my being trans and poly were defense mechanisms, like subconsciously trying to retake control of my body. I guess I'll never really know. I've tried to tell therapists and counselors, but i can't ever spit it out because i feel like they'll tell me repressed memories are a myth or I'm doing it for attention and i just don't know what to do.

5ed934569883864994ac0b97	1177_ptsd	"Introductory post..kinda?//about my PTSD Hi guys. I’m new to this sub reddit.


I’m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. 
I totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn’t do anything. 
I had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn’t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don’t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.
I’m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can’t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can’t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. 
I also watched the worst accident I’ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I’d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn’t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn’t ok to drive. 
So.. yea. I don’t really know where I was going with this, I guess I’m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they’re doing better now. 
I don’t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can’t even do those things.
I’m trying so hard. I just feel like it’s pointless sometimes. 

Anyway if you read this super long post..
Thank you. It feels nice to finally be able to have a voice."

I work in the mental health field. Which I suppose lead to my conversation with my room mate about his past.

I’ve lived here for a month and started my convos with my room mate very basic about games and pop culture. Eventually went into coronavirus which then lead to life and some of
His past.

Which eventually found out he tried to kill him self in service and his only coping methods is isolation, his cat, video games, and anti depressants.

He is quiet and clean. Good room mate. Likes to talk every now and then.

But I feel that he could blow any minute and if he loses his job that could be the trigger.

My first reaction was I have a friend whose a vet and great person who offered to reach out to my room mate. He refused the help. My friend said to suggest This local non profit that helps
Vets to him. He refused to use them as help as well. 

I honestly don’t think there is much I can do
If he doesn’t want help. It’s depressing for me to watch some one self destruct. Especially when I know there is ways for prevent it. 

Maybe in time he will trust me more and reconsider the resources I’ve suggested. 

He said I’m the first room mate he has had who cleans up apparently and has shown a genuine interest to his issues. 

Thanks for any advice,

I recently started seeing a counsellor specifically trained in my type of assault and am  going to actually start working through it. Today was my second appointment.

Half way through my appointment, we weren’t even talking about my trauma, I just started having flash backs. I couldn’t pull myself out of them. I could hear her talking to me but I could also just hear everything happening in the flash back over and over again.

Then of course I snapped back and had to explain what happened and talk about it and bawled my eyes out.

Ever since I just can’t get it out of my head. The months ahead are going to be tough, I can feel it.

5ed934569883864994ac0b97	1046_ptsd	"Finally getting help I had some childhood trauma.  And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   

I injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  

Well the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  

Luckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. 

I looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) 

 When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  

I went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a ""cookie cutter"" plan.

They explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. 

After going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  

They truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  

They also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    

With their help I have been clean 3.5 months.

It is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. 

So today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.

For the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future.... And it gets brighter every day!!!

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for another one of those 'life story' posts but i need to get it off my chest- and id hopefully like a sort of explanation for my behavior and maybe some ways to cope with it 

rundown of the socially bad things in my life:

i started going onto social media sites since i was maybe 11, and i was really proud of myself for the friends i'd make. when i had just turned 13, i joined a community and met an older person (23) who became infatuated with me. i liked the attention he gave me, and he'd always tell me i was his favorite person. he was incredibly possessive of me, would call me sexual pet names, and would get upset and passive aggressive if i made any mentions of other friends in front of him (or at all). i never sent nudes or anything of the sort, but he'd make me do sexual role playing with him. he would threaten to kill himself if i said anything about it and he would send me pictures of him cutting if i did something wrong. after i finally cut him off i found out a close friend of mine that i'd vent to was actually also him- he made a new account and identity to stalk me and watch me, even before i decided to leave him. that whole ordeal lasted about a year

&amp;#x200B;

i also had befriended a 21 year old sociopath. he did heavy drugs and was also very close to me- but never sexual. he was also possessive, and calls me his angel. he liked to send me imagery of how he'd kill me- and promised me one day he'd come and meet me. i'm still close with him, i don't think he's a bad person but at times he says and does stuff that makes me feel like i'm under someone's control again

&amp;#x200B;

now, i have a really screwed up idea of relationships. i don't get close to people often, i only have a few friends. i took a year 'off', which means i spend the time in complete isolation with no human connections or contact. for about two years, i had no lasting friendships- i'd get extremely attached to someone for a short period of time, and eventually cut them off or they'd cut me off. when i get close to someone, i become really clingy and nervous that they're going to leave me. i feel like no relationship (friendships included) give me satisfaction like those two did- i feel like i'm constantly chasing for the feeling of belonging to someone and being someone's 'favorite' again, even if it does mean im trapped in it. i have a hard time believing i have importance to my friends because im not the one person in their life 

&amp;#x200B;

i get nightmares a lot, i can't sleep throughout the night. i'm obsessed with routine- especially with friends, i send the same goodnight and good morning text to my best friends because it makes me feel good to be ingrained in someone's routine. sometimes i'll have fits where i feel like person 2 is coming to get me, and i'll find myself on the bathroom floor unable to look up because i'm scared he'll be there. sometimes i forget who my friends are and i feel like they're all identities of person #1, a few months ago i couldnt talk to my two best friends (online) for weeks because i was scared they were him.

&amp;#x200B;

i feel lonely all the time. i feel ashamed of myself for being so screwed up mentally- i always wish i was normal. my two best friends support me and they've been the most consistent, good people in my life but i still sometimes feel like it's not enough because i'm still so obsessed with belonging to someone like i belonged to those two men. they think i have c-ptsd from it- it would make sense, but i feel so guilty knowing some things other people have gone through.  i know for sure i have trauma from unrelated events- that's a whole other thing to get in to, but i don't think that affects the social aspects of what's been going on with me. i'm just not sure how to deal with any of it"	[]	"[{'start': 851, 'end': 895, 'span': ""he'd make me do sexual role playing with him"", 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 897, 'end': 930, 'span': 'he would threaten to kill himself', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 971, 'end': 1028, 'span': ' send me pictures of him cutting if i did something wrong', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1283, 'end': 1382, 'span': '\r\n\r\ni also had befriended a 21 year old sociopath. he did heavy drugs and was also very close to me', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1402, 'end': 1425, 'span': 'he was also possessive,', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1450, 'end': 1497, 'span': ""he liked to send me imagery of how he'd kill me"", 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 2822, 'end': 2847, 'span': "" sometimes i'll have fits"", 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

I haven’t enjoyed this day for years. A lot of bad things have happened on this day of the year from my mom beating me to threatening hospitalization to needing to run away to getting dumped mental breakdowns. To the point that every year I dread my birthday. Today I’m 19

School has been over for some weeks so I’m spending today as I have every day sitting around the house doing absolutely nothing except crying a little more and being more depressed. And that makes me sad. The day is over soon and I can’t enjoy it

My parents tell me all year I’m a bad kid and don’t deserve anything and they buy things for me then use them against me to guilt trip me. Whenever they’ve bought me huge gifts on my birthday I’ve had a panic attack and then they get angry with me for not wanting to accept them. 

I get depressed and feel guilt when people express excitement. I get depressed and guilty when people buy me gifts, or praise or compliment me, or ask what I want so I tell them I want nothing. 

But I do want to enjoy it. I just can’t make myself. I do want gifts and to feel appreciated but the guilt overwhelms me. I get so upset when people compliment me or do anything. So it’s just better if I’m alone. It’s just better if I get nothing. Then I mourn how the day was miserable and I can’t enjoy it and dread it for the next year. 

Like it’s a cycle I can’t break out of that I want to but I just can’t. It probably doesn’t make sense to anyone.  My friends offered to hang out with me but I’ve just been by myself. Today reminds me of all the ways I’ve done wrong in my life and how I’m not good enough and failing in so many ways .

When I was 7 he r*ped me and I didn’t tell my parents until October of 2018...Since then all that has happened it a switch of rooms because he used to have to walk through my room to get to his. He still lives with us because he has high functioning autism and can only really work at a grocery (as he is now). My parents don’t want him to work too much or he will no longer get disability and they’re scared he’ll have a fit at work and get fired even though he’s been working there for like 2 years and been fine.
We don’t have enough money to get him an apartment. My parents don’t think he could survive on his own, so I’m stuck living with him. 
Since I told he doesn’t talk to me or look at me. I do the same towards him. This was until maybe 3 months ago when he had an outburst and screamed at me saying I’m a “junkie lair who should finish what she started and kill yourself” (I used to smoke weed and have attempted suicide before). 
He’s had an outburst like this three times now where he yells at me while I lock myself in another room. Talked to my dad about it and he said unless he sexually touches me or punches me hard (not light shoving) they aren’t going to kick him out.
A week ago I was sleeping on the couch because it’s right by my parents room and makes me feel more sleep. He then went into the living room in the middle of the night and slept in the middle of the floor.
He’s being creepy. He yells at me like once every week and half calling me a lair etc. Being in a house with him without going to school or to friends makes me feel terrible.
I would stay at a friends but my mom has severe COPD so I can’t because of the virus.
I don’t think I can do anything. I’m only allowed to leave the house for a 2 hour walk every other day. I’m unable to function well enough to get my schoolwork done. I feel terrible. I feel unloved by my parents even though I KNOW they love me, but they refuse to do anything! It makes me feel terrible! I don’t want to hurt myself but I almost want to go to a psychward so I don’t have to be here! Or run away and live under a bridge! Or something! I feel so fucking trapped.
If you read all of this please at least comment “that’s fucked up” so I know I’m not crazy for feeling so terrible because my parents are acting like it’s not big deal while also saying they believe me and it’s making me feel nuts.

At the age of 8, I have seen a man who tried to take his life by using (meat) hooks. To make things worse, around the age of 13 I have seen a deadly car accident. To top it all of: at the age of 17 I conquered another suicide attempt. This time a roommate who tried to take her life using a knife. 

I got diagnosed with PTSD at the age of 16. This is also were I started EMDR. It helped me a lot and I am almost symptom-free. Because I have quite much experience, I would like to help others. This, and I want to try to talk about the things I have experienced, because I have always been silent about my past.

\-Backstory Time

My mother was married four times, and her third husband, was addicted to pills. I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. 

My mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. 

I know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.

My mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-It's all downhill from here folks.

So how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Almost up to speed

I have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. 

It was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.

There on after I’ve been battling my own thoughts and reoccurring episodes with many negative events in between then and now.

I’ve made many life changes, the most influential including 1 year of seeing a psychologist after being on medications, meeting my boyfriend who keeps me accountable on my actions, and maintaining a healthier life style.

So there’s a few things that keep me from going into a panic attack and recognizing that is key.

However, all my methods of coping today are not working after this dream I had. 
Writing is one of my methods, and I wrote this and I would really appreciate feedback or any insight on why I am not being able to withhold myself today.

“I’m writing this, because I am experiencing and attempting to avoid a full blown panic attack. I am stronger then my negative thoughts, and I do have the power to control them. Writing about it makes it seem less real, and it isn’t. My dream keeps playing in my head like a record and each time i get a glimpse of the record I avoid it. I avoid it as much as I can, because I am at work and I am capable of working a full time job without letting this effect me. So let’s talk about it, I dreamt that any type of thing that supported my idea of killing my self was personified. The first person was Brian, he was in the dream with the bullet hole in his brain with the gun in his left hand telling me “I did it, and you saw me do it. Why would you not want to get it over with? You are going to do it.” Then the sound of him shooting himself replayed in my head echoing. The 2nd person, wasn’t anyone I knew. It was a kid I saw hang himself on morbid reality, after the suicide I developed an almost sexual obsession with observing death. This was the first time I saw it happen on the internet, the same feeling echoed through my brain. The kid told me that it was my turn to be watched by the public. Then the video replayed in my dream with the sound of him struggling for air and finally passing. The third one was my ex husband, who was probably the worst. In the dream, he kept telling me to do it as he cut himself deeper and deeper in his arm. Then he said I’m gonna do it, all because of you too. You deserve to die, then at the end of the dream he kept holding me down to put a knife against my throat and said this is how it ends, just do it yourself.”

I am also looking into talking to someone I can somewhat relate to on this, talking to your friends about this typically doesn’t help me.

Last year I moved to a state in the USA  that gets very high humidity and heat during the summer and we are already experiencing humidity in January that is triggering my PTSD.

Humidity is a major trigger for me - I didn’t realize this until last year. It makes me feel suffocated, I have panic attacks or at the least various elements of a panic attack. I feel like I can’t breathe. Humidity has become a huge issue for me in being able to manage my PTSD as the suffocation and crushing feeling I feel replicates physical aspects of my trauma. I’m so concerned as we head into warmer months. 

I know I need to leave the area and that’s on my agenda, I just can’t do that before summer comes and goes. I am currently trying to come up with ways to manage my day to day life. Working from home, not venturing outside as much as possible. But even the ride from home to office is enough to send me into a spin for about an hour. At the worst of it last year I was afraid to leave my house because of the heat and humidity. So.... yes, I have to plan for all of this...but...

Any ideas, thoughts, similar experiences???? I am really worried about this. 

It may seem silly to be afraid of weather but the feeling of suffocation and what that reminds me of plus there is the addition of the climate I was in at the time.... and I think my body and mind just panics and I don’t know how to manage it while also trying to make my job not see me physically panic.

Over a year ago, I got out of a relationship because he would always guilt me into doing sexual things I knew I didn't want to do. He'd say stuff like 'don't you trust me?' and I felt like it's what I needed to do to be a good partner. But after every time, I'd have to hide in my bathroom for a few minutes and calm myself down from a panic attack. I was and still am full of guilt from the situation and can barely think about it without feeling disgusting. For the most part, I've kind of willed myself to stop thinking about the details but I remain hyper vigilant and paranoid that he's watching me (we still live in the same city). I've always suffered from anxiety and depression but my list of triggers has almost doubled in size, but for the most part, I can function like a normal person. 

I've found it really hard recently to keep everything straight in my head, and the fact that I still have feelings for him makes it to where I can't even take myself seriously about what happened. Maybe it was my fault after all and I'm just over exaggerating. 

I can't seem to be mad at him for anything but the few people I've confided in seem to be pretty pissed. It doesn't make sense.

February 2019 was the best and worst month of my life. I welcomed my biggest blessing my son on feb 4th, then 9 days later that joy turned to the most traumatic thing I’ve ever experienced. 

A quick back story: I had my child when i was 21. The birth of my son was very painless and the whole experience was very positive. No painful contractions, no complications with the csection or anything.

Back to the story. after a csection they give you narcotic pain meds. On feb 13th i started weening myself off the pills because i wasn’t in that much pain anymore. That whole day i felt like something was off in my body. I had chills but my body was hot and i felt nauseous. I figured it was the effects from no longer taking the pain meds. After hours of not feeling well my dad took my temperature and it was 104.3. My dad kept my baby while my boyfriend took me to the hospital. 

Upon arriving and telling them my symptoms i was immediately swarmed my so many doctors and nurses like the scene of a movie. They asked millions of questions and stuck IV’s and sensors all over me. 

Fast forward i learn i have sepsis and a blood clot in my ovarian vein. You’d think those are pretty simple fixes. Wrong. 

I spent 2 weeks in the hospital and i barely have any memory of most of it but i remember flashes. 

During that time i had several blood transfusions, blood drawn every 3 hours everyday for 2 weeks and they stuck me in a different vein every time, got given heparin (blood thinner) for the blood clot which they later realized i was allergic to do they switched me to another blood thinner, got given so many different antibiotics for the sepsis, had 3 different IV’s at the same time and a PICC line, had a foley Catheter and a feeding tube, was in the icu in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator, had to do physical therapy to walk, had to get my lungs drained after catching pneumonia from the ventilator, had to get fluid sucked out of my abdomen via ct machine needle insertion, and so many tests and labs i can’t keep up. 

Was sent home with 11 prescription as well as a blood thinner injection i had to give myself everyday. All while having a newborn at home waiting for me.

Most traumatic experience of my life. It still causes me bad anxiety til this day and it’s even worst a lot more happened that i can’t remember. I was there for 3 weeks but to me it felt like 3 days.

Still a year later i haven’t met anyone who can understand or relate to me regarding the experience"	[]	[{'start': 975, 'end': 2300, 'span': 'Upon arriving and telling them my symptoms i was immediately swarmed my so many doctors and nurses like the scene of a movie.

I mean absolutely no disrespect to those who do have PTSD and struggle with its symptoms. The last thing I want is to go around waving that phrase around carelessly and take away from those who have it.
Several months ago, my fiance had a seizure in my dorm. He has epilepsy so I've always had it in the back of my mind that if I notice anything weird to remain calm, but he is on meds for it and I had never witnessed a seizure before, so seeing him just stare at me and start screeching and convulsing out of the blue one afternoon took me by surprise.  I remained relatively ca and waited it out since he told me before that I shouldn't call an ambulance unless the seizure lasts a long time. I counted less than two minutes, which is fine. When he opened his eyes again, he didn't speak or seem like himself. He was just trying to  get up and climb on furniture while i tried my best to keep him from hurting himself. Eventually, he regained consciousness and asked what happened. I offered to take him to the hospital to get checked out since his dad recommended it over the phone, but he refused. A little later after he was back to normal he was on the phone, and my head rested on his lap. One minute he was talking, then the next minute I heard that awful screech again and jumped up. After two seizures, i decided to just call 911. He went to the hospital and all was well. 
For a long time, and even to this day, if he's joking around and accidentally makes a sound like he did or moves too suddenly, I panic for a second before realizing he isn't having a seizure. Early in I used to snap and get so angry at him for making weird sounds that sounded like that, but he honestly doesn't know what he sounds like during seizures and didn't mean to upset me, so i have gotten better about being more fair to him. We are long distance right now, and even when other people around me make strange sounds I feel my heart drop and I get so upset thinking that they could be having one even though no one in my family has ever had it. It gets me kind of angry to be frightened like that and ready to spring to action if need be only to find they're just being weird or having other less urgent issues. Is this ptsd, or just a more prominent anxiety? I do have a history of anxiety and am going to counseling for it."

In December, I decided to spontaneously cease contact with my dad when an opportunity arose. I had been ruminating over that thought for years. I thought I would be free of his emotional abuse, the feeling of being suffocated and having to answer to him. To my surprise, it got really bad. I began to dwell more on the past, and my mom was continuously making me feel guilty, claiming to not understand what could’ve possibly went wrong. This was exhausting to go through. I developed a severe marijuana addiction as a result of being unable to cope with those emotions. I was seeing a psychiatrist but they were ignorant to trauma. 

Last year, I witnessed the van attack in Toronto and it’s aftermath as I walked past Yonge street that day after work, bodies still laid down at 9 pm as the investigation wasn’t complete. This shook my sense of safety as well. I didn’t realize until my first appointment last week with a trauma specialist that it deeply disturbed me and made me incredibly uncomfortable in public. 

I’m almost done, I swear. 

Now I’m realizing how my mom was potentially worse than my dad in some regards. Some of the things she said to me when I decided to cut contact are now things that have made me want to stop contact with her. “I chose you my whole life over him and I suffered for it.” Not really something I wanted to hear, something she likely thinks I’ve forgotten. The more I think back, the more disturbed I get. I feel shackled to this fucked up family situation. The reason I haven’t gone entirely nuclear on my mom is because my younger sibling is still at home and it’s already been a difficult time since I ceased contact with my dad. My moms not making the house a very pleasant place (I moved out a while ago)

If you’ve read this far, I appreciate you so much. Present day, I feel like my chest is full of dread and I feel so heavy. My personal hygiene is a joke, and I’m riddled with intrusive thoughts about harming myself that I can’t listen to because my partner will notice. I feel like I’ve been robbed of a shot at life and I’m so angry for it. I feel like I can’t breathe. I’ve asked to see the therapist on a weekly basis because I’ve never felt so bad. I thought in my twenties I was making progress on my mental health and this all creeped up on me out of nowhere. I was well aware of my situation but it never felt so... life altering. I’m more and more aware of how I’ve been robbed of a childhood, robbed of a sense of safety, robbed from a life free of anxiety and depression. I’m so bitter and angry and I just want to scream. This past week has been a literal hell for me and I don’t know how to get by until my appointment. 

I’m not a danger to myself I just don’t know how to cope. I’ve done so many therapies, I have all the tools. It just all feels meaningless when my situation will never really change. I hate my life."

I checked myself into the loony bin about 18 hours after the suicide attempt and started (also finished) treatment.\r\n\r\nIt's been several months since and I started having bad dreams the last 2 weeks or so. I just woke up, not sure if it was a noise, the cat doing something, a dream, idk... I thought I was back in Iraq with a friend of mine who was in the shower when we got attacked and ended up decapitated. He died running naked to the bunker and ended up the result of a direct hit on the bunker. Was found with his head detached laying a few feet from his body still blinking and looking around with an extreme look of fear on his face.\r\n\r\nIn this dream, we started getting attacked and I told him to run for the bunker, then I ran the other way for a further bunker and I got knocked over and knocked out from percussion by the blast of when he got hit. That's when I woke up and I propped up out of bed, ran into the wall, stumbled and ran into the closet full bore and went face first into the wall in there. I fell over again and when I got back up I started coming to and noticed I was covered in blood, all over me, the clothes in the closet and all over the carpet."", 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of your night/morning and have a wonderful week. &lt;3"	[]	"[{'start': 1010, 'end': 7694, 'span': ""Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD.

5e7ca572facc782f64f2e4da	1191_ptsd	"Bullying gave me anxiety, anxiety made me an alcoholic and drug abuser, alcoholism gave me chronic gastrointestinal pain, and chronic gastrointestinal pain gave me intense homicidal feelings. I dropped out of school during my last year of high school because of extremely high levels of anxiety. This severe anxiety disorder started nearly a decade ago, because of the bullying I went through in middle school. I suffer from uncontrollable panic attacks (I would qualify those panic attacks as small heart attacks, given their intensity).

My first real panic attack happened back when I was in 8th grade (in 2007) and my phone got stolen from my backpack during PE. This might not seem catastrophic, but with this phone, I (stupidly) recorded myself jerking off while I was bored a few months prior , and I didn't erased the video (I know that it's dumb, but I was 13 at this time, and teens do stupid shit all the time). I completely forgot that this video was still on my phone's memory card, so when I figured out I got robbed, I was just angry about losing my phone, and about not knowing who stole it. I didn't realized what was about to happen. So I got home, (I lived with my mom back in middle school) told my mom that my phone got stolen, and she called the telephone operator to deactivate the sim card. To me it was no big deal....

The real drama started the following day, when I got back to school, and got laughed at by literally almost a hundred kids. I didn't understand why everybody was laughing hilariously, and then someone said to me ""I saw you beating your meat dude !"". I still didn't get it, then I remembered about the video I filmed a few months before with my phone, that I didn't erased.

I got ridiculed for the rest of my middle school years because of this, kids called me various degrading names, like faggot, pervert, wanker, weirdo etc.... During this time I began to sweat a lot because of anxiety, so I smelled like sweat all the time, so people humiliated me because of it, for example, one day during a math class, a girl complained to the teacher that I stink, and that she doesn't want to sit next to me, because my body odor makes her gag, of course everybody started laughing at me, even the teacher had a smirk on his face, but the teacher didn't let her move to another place.

I got beaten a lot, because I used to be skinny and short as a teenager, so I was an easy target, I got violently beaten countless times in the locker room during my middle school years, someone spat on me once, It is extremely humiliating to be spat on, I got treated like a pariah, like a punching bag (and I never reported it to the school administration or the police, out of shame, I never even told my parents about it to this day, and I regret not doing it, because there could have been an investigation to find out who stole that phone). The video was shared phone by phone, via Bluetooth, so my entire school saw me choking the chicken (seriously !).

I live in Martinique, an island in the middle of the caribbean. This island is part of France, so I'm French, but Martinique is a very ghetto and rough place. Living here feels more like Jamaica, or Brazilian favelas, than France. I've been to ghetto schools. The schools I went through were very ghetto-ish. The kind of schools where kids do drugs at 11, where a good portion of the girls get pregnant before 18. It is very traumatizing to get beaten by 5 or more kids. It feels like your manhood is taken away from you. People pick up on anxious vibes, and treat you like garbage because of it. Now I have PTSD from all this physical and verbal abuse.

The bullying greatly diminished in high school, because I went to a high school away from my hometown, where nobody saw this video. I moved from my mom's house to my dad's house, but the damage was already done. In high school, I got teased a little bit because people could notice my severe anxiety, for example people in high school used to tell me that I walk like I have a broomstick stuck up in my ass, and other hurtful things like that, but it was nothing compared to what I went through during middle school.

Because of all of this, I stupidly became a full-blown alcoholic during high school, to cope with anxiety / depression. I also heavily used drugs. This heavy alcohol and drug use led to all those health problems I have now. I want to commit suicide because I suffer from extreme anxiety, agoraphobia, chronic stomach pains and severe headaches. I went to a GP, I explained to him all my symptoms, then this GP sent me to a gastroenterologist, a neurologist, and a psychologist. The psychologist prescribed Xanax and Klonopin, and I did CBT for 4 months, but it didn't help me. The gastroenterologist and the neurologist got multiple tests done on me: A gastroscopy, MRI, blood tests, etc... but unfortunately they didn't figure out what's wrong with me.

I'm currently unemployed, I live with my father, and he is threatening to kick me out of the house. He has been very patient with me, but his patience is running out. I totally understand that he is not immortal, and he wants me to be independent, I don't hate him or anything, I love him, but how can I hold a job when I'm severely physically sick, and I have no diplomas, because I didn't graduate from high school ? From these years of intense bullying, I developed an extremely severe anxiety problem, and even almost 10 years after this happened, I still struggle with even basic human interaction.

This made me completely hateful of people, even though I know not everybody is a piece of shit. This left me in a state of perpetual, uncontrollable anxiety. I absolutely hate every single human being on Earth. If I do get a job, I will die from a stroke or a heart attack because of anxiety. I tried to get a disability allowance, but it got rejected TWICE. I lost pretty much all hope, and I feel like going on a killing spree at this point. I feel like going to a place where a lot of people gather, then cowardly killing as many people as I possibly can, The only thing preventing me from going on a killing spree is my belief in some form of reincarnation after death. If I go on a killing spree, there's only 2 options afterwards:

OPTION 1): I surrender to the police, I get sent to prison, and the prison where I will spend the rest of my life is a dirty, severely overcrowded mess. There's no protective custody there. This prison is organized in dorms, each one full of 40 to 50 violent people, high on crack/meth, HIV positive, murderers, thieves, rapists, etc.... I don't want to go to prison.

OPTION 2): I commit suicide to avoid prison bullying, but unfortunately, instead of finding eternal peace, I'll find temporary peace, then I'm going to be reborn as some creature on another planet somewhere far away from Earth, maybe as a penguin-like creature, and instead of having a good time in my next life surrounded by my new penguin friends, I'm going to get gang raped and abused because of bad karma. Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vs1d0fNEsE) poor fellow. What goes around comes around. I can avoid human justice easily, but unfortunately, I can't avoid the Universal justice system. I hate this world.

I hate this life so much, this life feels like a punishment. No matter what I do, I always end up getting fucked over. I fucking hate life. I want to say thank you to anyone reading this long wall of text, and sorry for the eventual grammatical errors, because English is not my main language (I'm French) Sharing life experiences with strangers on the Internet is helping me. I don't really plan on killing anyone, so don't call the cops on me, I'm just venting on the Internet."

This might not seem catastrophic, but with this phone, I (stupidly) recorded myself jerking off while I was bored a few months prior , and I didn\'t erased the video (I know that it\'s dumb, but I was 13 at this time, and teens do stupid shit all the time). I completely forgot that this video was still on my phone\'s memory card, so when I figured out I got robbed, I was just angry about losing my phone, and about not knowing who stole it. I didn\'t realized what was about to happen. So I got home, (I lived with my mom back in middle school) told my mom that my phone got stolen, and she called the telephone operator to deactivate the sim card. To me it was no big deal....\r\n\r\nThe real drama started the following day, when I got back to school, and got laughed at by literally almost a hundred kids. I didn\'t understand why everybody was laughing hilariously, and then someone said to me ""I saw you beating your meat dude !"". I still didn\'t get it, then I remembered about the video I filmed a few months before with my phone, that I didn\'t erased.\r\n\r\nI got ridiculed for the rest of my middle school years because of this, kids called me various degrading names, like faggot, pervert, wanker, weirdo etc.... During this time I began to sweat a lot because of anxiety, so I smelled like sweat all the time, so people humiliated me because of it, for example, one day during a math class, a girl complained to the teacher that I stink, and that she doesn\'t want to sit next to me, because my body odor makes her gag, of course everybody started laughing at me, even the teacher had a smirk on his face, but the teacher didn\'t let her move to another place.\r\n\r\nI got beaten a lot, because I used to be skinny and short as a teenager, so I was an easy target, I got violently beaten countless times in the locker room during my middle school years, someone spat on me once, It is extremely humiliating to be spat on, I got treated like a pariah, like a punching bag (and I never reported it to the school administration or the police, out of shame, I never even told my parents about it to this day, and I regret not doing it, because there could have been an investigation to find out who stole that phone). The video was shared phone by phone, via Bluetooth, so my entire school saw me choking the chicken (seriously !).\r\n\r\nI live in Martinique, an island in the middle of the caribbean. This island is part of France, so I\'m French, but Martinique is a very ghetto and rough place. Living here feels more like Jamaica, or Brazilian favelas, than France. I\'ve been to ghetto schools. The schools I went through were very ghetto-ish. The kind of schools where kids do drugs at 11, where a good portion of the girls get pregnant before 18. It is very traumatizing to get beaten by 5 or more kids. It feels like your manhood is taken away from you. People pick up on anxious vibes, and treat you like garbage because of it. Now I have PTSD from all this physical and verbal abuse.\r\n\r\nThe bullying greatly diminished in high school, because I went to a high school away from my hometown, where nobody saw this video. I moved from my mom\'s house to my dad\'s house, but the damage was already done. In high school, I got teased a little bit because people could notice my severe anxiety, for example people in high school used to tell me that I walk like I have a broomstick stuck up in my ass, and other hurtful things like that, but it was nothing compared to what I went through during middle school.\r\n\r\nBecause of all of this, I stupidly became a full-blown alcoholic during high school, to cope with anxiety / depression. I also heavily used drugs.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

I haven't got anywhere yet, and this is tough, just trying to ventilate something.  


I'm in my early 20s, I'm a male, I live in Europe and I have a girlfriend that tries to support me.  
I am struggling today with studies, my everyday mental state and doing what I think is required of me. But I don't seem to be able to carry all of it and sometimes it comes crashing down at me. I end up crying and downwards spiraling in my thoughts. I have trouble remembering stuff, I have trouble concentrating and it doesn't feel like I will ever get to where I want to be. I'm afraid, scared and it seems that I have gotten used to the feeling of it that I don't even notice anymore. My head is failing me and it was one of my best qualities about myself.  


I grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too. We were poor, there never was a ray of sunshine because new clouds of shit always came around.   


My earliest memories is me running from home, because my mother yelled at me to do so - because my dad was going to beat her. She told me to run to my aunt and make her call the police. I remember running, but not arriving there.  


I became the quiet kid, the kid that tried to fix everything and not cause any trouble. But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  
I had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either. I remember being in school, and people were complaining about things that seemed like nothing but I never could tell anyone.  


I remember feeling so horribly sad, and I went to talk with my mother. And she was high on the pills, because she said she saw angels but it was just light flashes from the cars driving by our window. And that hurt so much.  
I was crying and she didin't take care of me.   


When I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother. Everytime they came around, they always brought problems home. Always turned to a scream-fest and me being stuck infront of my PC - hoping that they don't come here.  


I never got beaten by my dad, but my dad beat everyone else. ( I can't remember how severe it was, but I don't think that anyone got hospitalized. ) And my mom told me that I should feel glad/lucky that he never did, because I was his son.  


I finally got to meet a therapist, I cried and did what I thought was nessecary to get past this.  
But it won't let me go, I just want to be healthy and be a normal person. I want to stop crying everyday, I want to feel good enough and not being so fucking pitiful. I was so strong, I thought.  


Then I tried cannabis, and I realised that not all drugs are bad and.. It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.  


Then.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze. I took some punches, told the truth and they wanted to beat someone else now.  
 (But it backfired in two hours and they wanted to meet me and prob beat me more.)  


When I left, I was glad that I had not pissed myself or started crying. But my head was racing, I had never been so alert in my life. Adrenaline.  
I did not realise that.. That was probarly the beginning of my PTSD. I became paranoid, I moved 2 days after that.  


7 months later, I was in the military. I was not forced, but I thought it was a good idea and a nice life experience.  
2,5-3 months in, it hit me. I started flinching, I started dreaming nightmares, I became dull in my head, I once grappled with a dude and.. I became so furious, and he had to hold me because, if he had let me go earlier than he did. I maybe would have done something rash. ( I can get angry, but I -never- act on it.. I did when I was a teen, but very rarely. )  


I had to drop out, I felt that I was a failure. I came back to my country where I was born. (Neighbour country.)  
I started living with my GF and.. That is where everything turned to shit.  


I have stopped crying while writing, so that's nice. But I must have been occupied.. Less than a hour, but more than 20 minutes.   


I have forgot to mention so much. Such as, I stopped being happy after the military. My symptoms worsened.  
I did not know what was wrong with me back then, now I do.  
It felt like I was at fault, but I know now that it's just a illness or whatever you may call it.   
(English is not my primary language.)

  
I'm going to talk to a therapist again, I'm waiting for a call. (Within 10 days.)  
I try to be transparent how I feel with my GF but it's hard and sometimes I want to just fight it through without her help, because I don't want to take even more from her than she already gives me.

  
I found this sub yesterday, I was looking for a place to ventilate. I can't keep crashing and crying infront of my awesome girlfriend, I -must- get better because I don't want to lose her. (She really is the best, my gf during military cheated twice. Nice.) Anyhow, I read a post and.. The person writing felt the same way I did, I could see myself in several other posts, people who have it better or worse. And I felt glad, that I'm not crazy and you people also feel like I do.  
I know, it's f\*\*ked up but thank you for feeling like this and thank you for sharing!"

66588675c6cf038dad7c95e9	1074_ptsd	"Another terrible anniversary. Woke up crying. I'm ashamed and I hate myself. (Sexual abuse and violence) I missed the primary elections two years ago because two years ago yesterday, my ex dislocated my arm in three places in the wee hours of the morning and threw my car/house keys into his lawn in the dark and rain. I was still trying to get it back together because I couldn't explain it at the ER and I didn't want insurance make me have to face him in court. I should have seen it coming. Three months before that, he screamed in my face and grabbed me by the shoulders. I ignored the blazing red flags. I still experience daily pain. Roughly twelve hours before that he'd shoved me over the couch (I have a serious back injury which I finally had my spine fused for recently, and that has long been a huge no no for me) and yanked my pants down to try to fuck me while his 4 y.o. daughter was in the bathroom. He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly. I was shocked because he hadn't done anything like that in the 11.5 months we'd been together, but as a testament to my prior experiences with abuse, I saw it as nothing terribly abnormal. This was what I'd always known relationships to be, whether it be family, friends, or intimate relationships.

I was supposed to move in with them in a couple weeks. I wanted to wait until a year in, because I knew deep down he was a bad guy, but I wanted to be wrong. I wanted to be a mom (I can't have kids), and I wanted to save his daughter from the life I had growing up. He used this all against me. He's a narcissist and has some severely anti-social tendencies. 

Last night I had a nightmare involving me babysitting for him and his ex-wife, and their friends drugging me to rape me when they brought the party home. It brought back all the bad and my husband (we met two years ago next month) has super-hearing abilities and heard me crying while he was in the bathroom getting ready for work. He came out to hold me. Now he's gone and I'm crying again, damn it. It brought back all the memories of all the physical and sexual assaults and rapes I've experienced. People like that can smell a victim a mile away. 

The shame is so overwhelming right now. That I let it happen. My entire life. From the first time I didn't say anything aged six. I just want to forget. I don't want to feel these people touching me. So many people, so many times, I've literally lost count. The things I've let happen because I never understood that people who love you don't hurt you like that. Things I let happen because I was conditioned to believe from such a young age that that is what life is. Hiding, hurting, and being used. Because I never saw the value in myself as a person. I still don't. I'm a garbage person. 

My husband was the first to tell me that it wasn't normal to let myself be an object. A fuck toy and a punching bag. I had just accepted my fate that it was my place to be used and abused. That my normal was to live in fear of being hurt or fucked. I was 34 when we met. Now, after all the years of being used like a Kleenex, I feel so dirty, ashamed, and undeserving of someone as wonderful as he is. I feel like if he truly knew all that had happened, all the things I let happen, though I've shared a lot with him, that he would be disgusted. He's a better person than that, I know. But I feel unworthy of love, and unworthy of the safety I have with him now. This morning I told him I often wonder if I'd met him sooner, if I'd believe him or just brush him off as some bullshit fairytale who would eventually hurt me in the same ways. It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that.

I'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all. A couple months ago I asked my psychiatrist if ECT would make me forget. Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. 

Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.

66588675c6cf038dad7c95e9	1066_ptsd	"What to do when it feels like too much? I opened the can of worms recently (a few years ago), and started dealing with my trauma. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 16.  Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. 

*My dad did drugs
*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once
*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once
*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)
*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.
*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)
*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we ""misbehaved"" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.
*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. 
*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. 
*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. 
*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.
*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.
*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. 
*I was in a ""relationship"" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).
*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. 

All of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.

I want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old. I want a chance to be 5 again. But I don't want to die.

I don't know what to do.

66588675c6cf038dad7c95e9	1225_ptsd	"Possible trauma from hospitalization, and people think I need to get over it. I was 21 at the time, now I'm 22. In May of 2017, I got really sick out of no where. In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. 

At 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. 

The doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said ""what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?"" I said I didn't know what was wrong. 

After they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. 

They discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a ""nasty fever"" and told me to rest for a few days.

At 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. 

Positive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.

Being septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. 

I returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). 

Now I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. 

I constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit.

TL;DR History of sexual assault. I feeI like a fake because people have had it so much worse than me and yet my ptsd runs my life. Feel embarrassed by my lack of experience with men which is a consequence of PTSD.

I have struggled with this for a long time and I have avoided posting about it because I have been afraid of people confirming these feelings. I have been on medication prescribed to me for PTSD for a few years now and this has been my only way of allowing myself to feel valid. I don't tell people about my PTSD but when I have to I feel like I need to somehow slip the fact that I am medicated into the disclosure so that I will be taken seriously. When I say ""have to"" I am referring to situations such as the time I signed up for a self defense class and I needed them to know not to get on top of me in any way (will make sense later) and that I needed a female teacher. I needed to mention the PTSD for context. 

A little background: I have always had a fear of men and I can't really pinpoint when it started or why, but it was always more severe than the unfortunately common intimidation that many women tend to feel. I remember feeling this way as early as 7 or 8. I would avoid men in general. Experiences such as being cat called and followed in my early teens made it worse. 

The experience which really caused my PTSD happened just after i moved away from home for college. I was at a friends house one night and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up in the middle of the night with a guy 'friend' straddling me and giving me hickeys and trying to take off my clothing. I told him to get off me multiple times and he didn't. I curled up into a fetal position until he gave up and left. It felt like he was on top of me for hours but I'm guessing it was more like 15 or 20 minutes. Nothing more happened, he got off me and fell asleep somewhere in the apartment, but it left me anxious and depressed for months.  I felt dirty and guilty. I couldn't look men in the eyes and any romantic attention from men felt even more threatening than it did for me already, even if I knew that they were probably very nice guys. Because of this I have never had a boyfriend. Never slept with a man. The first and last time I had sexual contact with a man was when I woke up to someone who I thought I could trust sucking on my neck and putting his hand under my blanket. I am nearly 25 now. Its embarrassing to me and I am afraid that, at this point, if I manage to move past the anxiety of male attention that I will scare away any man with my lack of experience.

That was the first one. The second event, which blew everything up, was when I was jumped walking home at night. I am a runner and a lot stronger than I look as a small woman and managed to get away. It left me so traumatized, though, because I tried really hard to get help and no one would help me. The security guard at my apartment building told me to stop talking and tell the female security guard who was only going to be working 4 days later, and the police laughed at me when I described what happened. (Might sound unlikely but I was living in another country at this time and this isnt uncommon behavior there).

At this point I would physically start to shake if I was hanging out with a man and he got touchy. Panic attack symptoms minus hyperventilation. 
I would feel my body go cold and my muscles seize up. There was a situation when I was trying to get over this all and had been on a few dates with a guy. He kissed me and all was fine until he touched my thigh and I started having a panic attack. I was so embarrassed and humiliated because he immediately left the room to tell him roommates. Yes, I know, I found myself an asshole.

That left me with really unhealthy views of men (even more than before) and I genuinely believed for a very long time that men did not feel love and that any appearance of love was purely a form of manipulation. These experiences along with an unfortunate mother (who would tell me things like ""all men cheat"") caused me to be so scared to fall in love because to me that would mean being a slave. It took me a very long time to realise that men do feel love. People will probably be wondering this: my father is in my life and he is a good man. One of the most honest and loving people I know. No issues there.

Anyway, here I am years later. I have been through therapy, take antianxiety/antidepressants and have managed to cut down my PTSD meds to ""as needed"". So, Prazosin when I have nightmares, and that's all. I still get incredibly uncomfortable with men touching me and i am terrified of sex and it stops me from pursuing men I like. I am so worried that they will not be patient with me and that i am embarrassing. 

It's also hard to know when to bring this up with a man because I dont want to scare him off but at the same time I dont want him to scare me off by going at a pace I cant handle. 

To bring it back to my post title....I feel like a fraud. There are women who have been through experiences infinitely worse than mine and yet here I am complaining about it. It's so hard to like life. I really dont like life right now."	[]	"[{'start': 198, 'end': 225, 'span': 'History of sexual assault.

6661afeb07b10535305f29b0	636_ptsd	"I'm (F20) really bad at this whole ""coping"" thing Hi. I'm new to this subreddit, so I hope I dont violate the rules with this.

I've had PTSD for a while. I was assaulted as a child, by my cousin, then again at 11 by my boyfriendwho was 16, and again at 14 by a different boyfriend. I never told anyone, even my therapists, I was ""normal"" in my eyes, because until two years ago some of the incidents never resonated as an assault. I was conditioned to think they were normal things that teen girls do with or for the older men in their lives. My therapist knew though, I think. They're trained to know, especially when a young kid is edging around certain subjects like their love life or past boyfriends.

Well, a friend who knew me and my first boyfriend (the one who assaulted me at 11), has recently started hanging out with him again after years of no connection. He's apparently VERY different now, but she doesn't know that he assaulted me. She keeps pressuring me into going to their friend's house to hang out, she keeps texting me funny things he's said to her, and I woke up early this morning read a text from her about him and fell back asleep because it was early. 

I had a TERRIBLE nightmare, I woke up and didnt even remember where I was. I won't go into details, but it SEVERELY affected me. I dont know what I want to do, I want to run away and stay put. I want to cry and I want to brush it off. I dont know what to do, because i never played into the PTSD. I didnt want my siblings or parents to know, i didnt want anyone to know. I never told anyone about that diagnosis and now? I wish i had.

This same friend also dated the other boyfriend who assaulted and stalked me (for four years, as a minor, he was an adult). I'm open about the stalking, I told her when she asked me, but I never told her about the assault. We worked together and he would wait for her (she worked in the back mostly, I worked in the front of the restaurant), but he always watched me. Always did things to make me jump, like leaving so I'd be comfortable and wait for me to relax, then he'd reappear. 

I was fine until I wasn't, and it feels like today was a breaking point. I feel scared and angry. And like no one will understand. 'Why didnt I speak up before?' 'Why didnt I tell anyone?' And I'm just scared. I dont even want a hug, or someone to hold my hand, I dont want anything. I just went to my room instead of taking a hike like I wanted and started hyperventilating, I cried. Like I never have before. 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I can't find anywhere else to put it. I just wanna throw up and hide. Am I overreacting? Is this all in my head?

Anyways, best wishes all, stay safe and occupied during this stressful time."	[]	"[{'start': 2169, 'end': 2286, 'span': ""a breaking point. I feel scared and angry. And like no one will understand. 'Why didnt I speak up before?' 'Why didnt"", 'annotation': 'trauma'}]"

5e9779d5f867330e192fe7e5	1021_counseling	I am very sorry to hear of your struggles.  I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself.  Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.I notice that you said he left you.  This tells me that you didn’t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you.  Low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can’t do any better.  Also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get.  The way I see it, he did you a favor.   You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be. Take this time alone to work on you.  As hurtful as it may be that other people don’t want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you.  Your statement “I don’t feel like I exist anymore” tells me that in addition to low self-esteem, you also don’t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are.  People can and will let you down.  It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and to gain a stronger sense of self. Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it.  Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good.  Find a hobby that you enjoy.  Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily.  Google “positive affirmations” to find some that resonate with you.  Such statements might be “I am a good person who deserves to be happy” or “I can do this.”  Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well.  There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search.Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing.  When you are a happier, more stable person, the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them.  Good luck with rebuilding your life.  I know it is hard!  Remember to take it one day at a time.	[]	[{'start': 431, 'end': 489, 'span': 'emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

Now, I find myself thinking everything has gone away and like I'm okay. But I'm not. Every time I see something related to it, everything comes flooding back. 

My main concern is that I just, my brain seems ""broken"". I constantly have repetitive thoughts I can't control, and they're intrusive and scary (not in a violent way but it's always something im afraid of) and I've been having this extreme problem where my brain just seems to malfunction like fucking shit. Except it doesn't manifest in me seeing what happened before, it manifests in completely seperate and mild situations and even fears. It's like it's a disease that slowly grows roots into my brain and all that, even long past it being over.

It's like I'm putting the emotions from my trauma into everything here and now, that I think about even if it's not related. And then I don't even remember why I'm feeling what I am. And things just seem to be taking over in a way where everything haunts me, but I forget why so I literally have no idea why I feel the way I do. The only reason why I realized this could be because of PTSD is because someone mentioned it. But it's just so frustrating, it's like remembering a smell from a memory but you have no idea what the smell is or the context. And these feelings linger and screw with my head.

Things have been going well for the most part, with the exception of a small misunderstanding that resulted in him going silent for about 2 weeks. We spoke and moved past that but last night marked our newest miscommunication.

Early in the relationship, A expressed to me that sometimes he has a hard time with seeing blood. That it makes him uncomfortable but he’s good for the most part. We planned to spend this weekend together, sort of a little stay-cation. Yesterday, we arrived at our accommodations, ate a nice meal and I changed into something sexy for him. Things were going great. We had been very excited, this would have been our first time
waking up together. Eventually, we were intimate with each other (not the first time). During sex, I started to bleed a bit. A mild-moderate amount, but enough for him to notice. He immediately went to the bathroom and spent about 5 minutes cleaning himself off. He was very uncomfortable with it. Once we sat back down, he didn’t even touch me. He’s very well endowed, over 8 easily so I suspect that has something to do with it. We discussed this, and that that is most likely what caused the bleeding. He was unable to move on from it. He explained to me that he was having severe anxiety over it, and that he wasn’t trying to be a jerk but that the smell/sight of blood is hard for him as he’s seen so much of it in his life. He shared briefly that he’s smelled blood burning, and seen wounds. I was open and listening at assured him that I want to be there for him and whatever he needs I want to try to do. Eventually, he said he needed to leave to go get his medicine(I’m assuming for anxiety). He kissed me, hugged me and damn near ran out of the hotel room.

I’m struggling with a few feelings at the moment. I feel resentful that he left me, on a weekend we planned together, alone in a hotel room at 10pm and didn’t care enough to text me and check on me last night or make sure I was safe this morning. I feel self conscious that after sex, he sat away from me on the bed as if he was repulsed by me. I’m also empathetic to him, and I want to be there for him and his support system but I’m being shut out. I don’t know what to do. I called once when I woke up, then sent a cute little “sending you smiles” gif.... nothing in return from a man who texts me Goodmorning every day. 

At this point, I suppose the only option is to step back and let him reach out to me when he’s ready, but I’m a communicator and this is 100% opposite of my nature.

She has broken up with me twice; the second time was very traumatic and sudden, and I am still getting over it. I have developed PTSD as a result of being involved with her. 

The mere thought of returning to university induces a panic attack; she is likely to ignore me (which she’s done often in the past) and this too causes panic attacks. 

She acts very charming and happy with everyone in the class, and even seeing her do this makes me feel anxious. Her entire presence causes me stress and anxiety. The sight of the university building causes me anxiety. Everything to do with her and the university makes me ill. 

I am worried about going back there, and I’m starting to think I’m not able to.

I was prescribed trazadone of 1 to 3 tablets a night and it’s insane how heavy the carry over is into the next day. And I’ve had other sleeping medications and it’s the same thing. I just feel so exhausted all the time because I know my quality of sleep is not good. 

My partner, bless him, I swear, tells me he hears me talking and grinding my teeth hard in my sleep. I also sweat to the point of soaking my sheets and every morning I wake up and my hair is so wet you’d think I just stepped out of the shower. It makes me so self conscious to say, but I’m having the most trouble communicating with my doctor my struggles. 

I used to have terrifying vivid nightmares but I haven’t really had them/ remembered any of them since I started smoking marijuana a few years ago. My partner says he thinks I’m having them sometimes. I don’t really know what to do. 

I’m not in a legal green state otherwise I’d have my medical card and I’m sure more of my doctors support, but I’m not so sure. She knows I smoke and doesn’t hate it but doesn’t approve. My therapist doesn’t give a shit. 

Tonight I was even having such a hard time I just bursted out crying after having an outburst at a banker because of having no money due to the holiday and me getting off late every Friday to be unable to deposit my check until after hours and my bank said something was possible and tldr when I get there it’s the opposite so I’m full of frustration and lately I’ve been feeling as if I’ve been disassociating and just disappearing into space with the fact that I’ve had a lot of time off of work lately because my boss has been on vacation I just kind of summed it up to having too much time on my hands.

 And while that’s partially true, I have had too much time to sit around with just me and my thoughts. I also recognize that I have a harder time around the holidays and winter in general. 

So tonight I canceled my late therapy appointment and just came home and drank wine in a onzie and cried until I smoked enough to feel good enough not to cry. 

I’ve been having a hard time talking to my therapist because I don’t ever know what to say. She presses a little and I just say it sucks and it is what it is and I can’t change it and then like it’s book closed. 

I don’t know how to communicate or open up I don’t know what I’m supposed to do to get over this because I need to feel like a fully functioning human being to work and be alive. But I can’t do that if I’m always sleepy and just shut out. 

I don’t feel as shut out with my partner but I’m happier around him and the air feels more clear. He knows my trauma and my shit and we don’t elaborate further, not that it’s a problem it’s horrible. 

I just need to know what I’m doing wrong because I’m trying so hard and this cycle sucks. Advice on sleep, sweats, and talking to your therapist would be dope.

I still occasionally get panic attacks and sometimes they aren’t related to the incident, the last major panic attack I had was probably very recent after the incident.  I was too prideful to admit I needed help/ therapy and lately my anxiety has been getting bad, not even relating to the accident but school, etc. 


Yesterday there was an incident in my college town that resulted in a student death. I didn’t know the student, but several of my friends did from either back home or here at school so I was pretty upset to hear the news. 

Later that night I had a dream that I was at the scene of the incident and although they weren’t really similar incidents, I think it subconsciously reminded me of my incident and I had the worst panic attack I’ve ever had, all while dreaming. It was so vivid. I think I knew I was dreaming but I still could not calm down. I woke up later, not immediately after that and was soaked in sweat. 

It was different than the usual nightmare/ being scared etc. It was like I was reliving my past trauma again for the first time. 

TL; DR - Had a dream of an event that reminded me of past trauma that I never received help for &amp; relived a similar experience leading to a massive panic attack all while dreaming but it felt the exact same as if I was awake.

I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.

I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.

I just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? 

A few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.

I feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. 

I think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough.

665dca402df6df4388baf19d	366_ptsd	"TW: SA and self-harm/suicide mentioned—Unable to process events healthily 2 years ago I was sexually assaulted by a close friend from an extremely tight-knit group of friends at a party my freshman year at an elite music conservatory. I reported it to the school and was basically called a drunk slut unable to properly recall what happened. I left because I was in a downward spiral and was going to kill myself and was self-harming and not taking care of myself. 

I want nothing more than to move on from it all. I thought one way to move on was to help out a friend-of-a-friend who is a journalism student at my old school who was writing a report on the title ix department there. I was happy to oblige but it became all too much and one night while I was very drunk, I decided to look for some documentation he had asked for, and everything came spiraling back and I began inconsolably crying. For hours, I cried so hard that I woke up my roommate. 

The thing is, that was the first time I even approached anything close to processing my trauma. I have been in therapy since I was 15 and especially since I was assaulted, but I’ve never been able to catharize the deep, conflicting emotional hang ups I have with the friends I sorely, sorely miss; the assaulter whom I can never really escape without shutting out any person from that extremely tightly knit group of friends; the youth/naïvety/innocence I had before all of that. I just want to cry about it, but I’ve compartmentalized and can’t soberly, healthily access the emotional capacity required to let out the anguish, confusion, anger, longing, isolation, desperation, and all of the half-discernible emotions that lie in between. 

I’m not sure what I’m hoping to get out of Reddit from this but all of my friends, who *have* helped me through this, are asleep and I’m too anxious to follow suit and needed a place to vent."

So to start off, I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, but I do suffer from trauma and I didn't know a better place to ask for help.

My story is rather personal, but in a nutshell: I have suffered and still suffer from verbal and also, probably, emotional abuse from a family member. Screaming, cursing, and other awful things have been said over the course of many years (I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said over the course of my entire life).
All this left me traumatised, a major depressive disorder and also anxiety, which is luckily in remission. But I still suffer from images of specific events and also from stress. I can't live a day without thinking of the event and experiencing at least some stress. Now I know it's nothing extraordinary, but it does really haunt me. 

Now I'm asking for advice, but that's where matters become more complicated. I still live with said family member and that will likely remain the case for at least a few years.
So I am asking for advice on how to deal with past traumatic experiences and also for advice on how to deal with the present.

I have a bunch of debt, no sense of self, university dropout and no idea what I want in life. 

The only thing I want to do is travel but I don't make enough. I want to backpack Europe but even for that I'd need a good few thousand. 

Today, I got fired from my job. I wasn't the best employee but I spoke french and English which most others couldn't and I we had occasional french customers, I was early, I was fast on the cash register, I followed the dress code and didn't stand around talking for 40 mins where most others barely did that... managers included.. 

There were 4 managers and I had no problem with the first 3. The 4th one was a narc that totally triangulated the other 3 against me and I noticed a shift in their attitudes towards me after she decided to have a vendetta against me. She would constantly minimize me, be passive aggressive, push only my breaks back but no one else's and nit pick me to a T. Other employees agreed that they saw this happening. 

Today I woke up feeling amazing after a deep sleep meditation on YouTube- only to get fired as they told me right before my shift. This really shook me and made my PTSD worse and I've felt like crap all day today... It was the only thing that helped me build motivation, my job. It's this constant cycle of me barely surviving and then other people tearing me apart. 

Ive suffered severe attachment traumas. I have never had parents there for me, never had true friends, never had a boyfriend or a true love interest in my life. I've been used by narcissists sexually, mentally and emotionally. My mom has used my mind against me. I can't find real friends. I can't even connect to my
True self it seems. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm in this trance like fog state and I can't think right. I need to get away from the narc mom I live with but I don't make enough and now being fired I definitely don't make enough.

I guess I should look for a new more full time job but it's really hard keeping a job because I keep a) attracting narcissists who can't be pleased or b) my depression and PTSD gets perceived as bitchiness/ laziness, despite that I do try. 

I guess being on meds would help but I don't know the necessary steps to obtain them without family doctor  ( I live in Ontario Canada)

665dca402df6df4388baf19d	940_ptsd	"I was watching Agents of Shield last night and I was severely triggered. I have no idea how to proceed. TW- Mental Illness/Kidnapping/Death/Childhood Abuse. This is a lot to unpack. I didn't know what to label the trigger warning in the title. I don't really know what this is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I was watching Agents of Shield. For anyone who is not familiar, an agent of the government died and was sent to Tahiti after his director and medical staff saved his life. Nobody seems to know how long he was really dead.

&amp;#x200B;

Then he starts having nightmares and slowly remembers the truth. He gets kidnapped and put into a machine that forces him to remember. He was never in Tahiti at all. He was dead for days, and he was put into a medical lab for display to the other, higher up members of his agency. His skull was off the top of his head, and his brain was being surgically worked on while everyone, including his direct supervisor, watched. One of the nurses was arguing with the one who was directly operating on his brain, and he was saying ""This is inhumane! Who ordered this?"" The other nurse replied that it was the agents direct supervisor, who was watching from above. They never knocked him out. Everyone stood by and watched him scream. He was saying ""Please, just let me die! Just let me die!"" He found the nurse who kept saying that the surgery was inhumane, and was told the truth; the memory he was brought back to was a fragment of what happened. He was on call for the seventh operation, and he didn't know what the operation was until he was in the room with everyone watching above. It's unknown how many there actually were, but he was 'in Tahiti' for a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

It brought me back to my teenage years. I was abused by my mother. I was bullied by my 'friends'. I have severe BPD from all of the trauma (the parental abuse lasted years) and all I wanted for a good two years was just to die. The pain was too much, and all I wanted was for everyone to let me go. Nobody cared how much pain I was in, including my direct bloodline, my mother. She just stood by and watched, and added to my misery. Just like the direct supervisor did with his agent. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped watching immediately and called my husband, who was at work. I tried to hold it in but I just cried and told him that I couldn't wait for him to come home. He knows I was severely triggered but I told him I didn't want to talk about it, I wasn't ready and I still don't think I am. All of that was five years ago now, and the more time that passes by, the easier it gets. I did therapy. I'm on medication. I was actually doing really well until about a week ago, where I started slipping back into a depression. That just punched me in the gut, and I feel like I'm right back to where I started; scared and not knowing how to cope.

I avoid thinking about them, and I avoid thinking about them. And yet, I can feel they are there in my “soul”. After one particularly dark patch of my life where I couldn’t get suicide off my mind, I thought I should air my dirty laundry. I shared what had happened to my wife for the first time. Not the details, just the broad strokes. I talked to old veteran buddies who were there with me. I even called to start up the therapy. But every time I talked about it, I would feel so much worse.

And I would think to myself “is this emotional reaction even appropriate?

I was raised by a narcissistic physically and verbally abusive mother and sister.  An emotionally absent, verbally abusive father.  I suffered sexual abuse by I don't know who all.  I know it was older kids in the neighborhood, but I have long thought there was an adult involved as well.  I am an HSP and have severe OCD.

I read this forum, and the CPTSD forum, and it seems most avoid sex.  I avoid romantic sex, but the crazier and kinkier it is the more I want it.  If I am ""making love"" with my wife I can't stand it.  I feel weird, and usually cannot complete the session.  If it's a kink fest, the weirder the better, it's the best sex ever.

I have always been that way.  In my teen and early adult years I would have sex with anyone, any sex.  Made life difficult in the 80's in the deep south.  But I was known to make you feel friggin' amazing.

But it seems to all boil down to I have to be giving others pleasure.  My own is not even a consideration for me.  My pleasure is in debasing myself to whatever level to make whoever I am with have amazing sex.  My germaphobic OCD is probably the only reason I haven't had anything worse than chlamydia.  Kept me faithful to my wife as well probably.

This is my first post ever and because i’ve been a long time lurker I’ve decided to ask for your guys advise because of the great support Reddit gives each other. English is not my first language so bare with me please..

A little bit of background story. Started grown up job which consited of driving a lot. Had 2 car accidents in a short period of time. After the second one I couldnt take anything anymore and felt like I was having a mental meltdown. Worked since i was 14 and couldnt lift a finger after the accident. Felt like I was losing my mind literally. 

Couldnt talk to people normally without crying and wasnt myself anymore. Childhood things arose during therapy sessions like arguing of my parents and molestations from family member. I thought that I outgrew everything but after the accidents I cant live my normal life without thinking about the past, crying and feeling worthless. My love for people and life dissapeard as if was never there and was feeling quite suicidal without wanting to be actually dead for a long while.

Was going to therapy since the beginning. Therapist was thinking about PTSD but after telling her that my normal doctor suspected me from having post concussion syndrome (because of the forgetfulness, headaches dizziness etc) she is waiting for other test i guess to conclude that it really is ptsd.

Im really hopeless and want to do just anything to get better. So my question is can anyone relate to this or what do you advise me to tell my therapist because I really wanted to start EMDR and I feel as if it is going to take forever..

I grew up in an abusive household with my mother and step father. Mother would beat me and my step father would molest me since I was as young as 7 or 8 yrs old... or well what I can remember up until I was about 12. When I turned 13  I moved in with my sexist father.

Fast forward 2 years, I met my now ex of 4 years. I lost my virginity to him, however, he turned out to be very abusive 8 months into the relationship.  He raped me, beat me, and verbally abused me. Took 4 years to really get out of that toxic relationship.

Shortly after the break up  I was raped by someone I thought I was becoming friends with. BUT then again... what did I know about making friends. I was an outcast and had no friends growing up and my ex wouldn't let me have friends. Anyways this person stalked me and threatened me after. I quit my job and moved shortly after not too far but where he didn't know I lived.


In between and after all this... quite a few men has looked at me or/and treated me like some sort of toy for their pleasure. 

I'm so emotionally broken. I don't know what to do with myself sometimes. Since then I've met an amazing person who treats me right ... but I don't know if I really want to be with this person. I've made friends that don't hurt me and seem to care. 

But I have no one I can really talk to about all this. I mean they know the gist. But I'm that ""happy friend""-- you know the one that is never sad or cries, the one who listens and is always smiling. Keeping those happy, positive vibes.

Deep down though ... I'm sad. I struggle with a lot of anxiety and depression. I have PTSD and try so hard to push through each and every day. Some days It feels easier than others. Most days I can't focus on anything and am completely overwhelmed with my memories, thoughts, emotions. 

I don't feel like anyone around me truely understands what a toll all this has taken on me and how much it actually hurts me. To them it seems like because it is in the past I should be just fine and dandy now (like out of sight - out of mind type thing) or they simply have nothing helpful to say. 

I can't really blame them for not understanding. But I'm just going through it right now. My anxiety has been through the roof and I stupidly start to shake uncontrollably and breathing sounds like I'm shivering.

665dca402df6df4388baf19d	334_ptsd	"Could this be considered traumatic? NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.

 I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.

My father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to ""discuss"" it. ""Discussion"" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining ""how things are""- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to ""misunderstand"", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a ""discussion"". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.

This was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing ""privilegies"" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and ""llike you mean it"". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.

Sometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.

I was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.

Limited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.

My friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.

I realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.

665dca402df6df4388baf19d	847_counseling	I need help controlling my anger. Anger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues.    Anger also helps us understand that there’s something wrong that needs to change.   Once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry, then we can explore the source of anger.  Ask yourself: Why am angry, Am I hurt, disappointed, confused, embarrassed etc. ?  Once you find the answer, explore how often that happens and what’s your reaction.   Then explore how else you could respond or react.   You could use I-statements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario.   This is a good exercise to practice with your Counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration, especially if you have been angry for a long timeAlso, it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggression and learn to manage our anger before we act on it.   Anger is a feeling; aggression is when you act out your anger physically, verbally and psychologically.   Find ways to vent: crying or sweating will help to release your anger, and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry.   Physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotions.

665dca402df6df4388baf19d	716_ptsd	"PTSD Flashbacks, maybe Disassociation My friend of 4 years had a bad flashback the other night. She has Tourettes, Anxiety, Rage Attacks, PTSD, and some more that go along with all of them. She gets PTSD from being filmed (father would film her as a child to send out to doctors) Also gets PTSD from men being aggressive and angry in her face (ex would beat her and another ex would trigger her on purpose, so this might actually be CPTSD)

&amp;#x200B;

So the other night she was out drinking and came over at 3:30am because she was having bad Anxiety and wanted to be comforted. I get her ready for bed and went back downstairs to finish a game before I shut my PC off. She came right down and hit the back of my head. I stood up and was in shock, she threw her arms up and said ""What are you gonna do, hit me!?"" I grabbed my phone and started to record her for proof. She backed away and hid from the camera. Eventually she started to hit herself, most likely the tics from tourettes. I took the phone out again to record her and she saw me doing this and it triggered her, she took the phone and began attacking me and herself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to get my phone back to call the police but she did a good job keeping me from it, I was yelling and in her face because I was pissed. She kept attacking me and had my phone. This triggered her into a flashback I believe. Her mood completely flipped to a calm person, looked at me and said ""I forgive you if you slap the fucking shit out of me, you fucking pussy"" She then actually slapped herself and then began to choke herself why saying her ex's name. The rest of the story is the same, I eventually get my car keys and run. I get to a friends house to call the cops and meet them back at my house. I get arrested because she claims I attempted to murder her by choking her to death. I got arrested right away and the cops didn't even get my statement or ask me anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My question to you all is How can you make someone aware that an event they thought was real (flashback).. wasn't?** In her mind she thought I was doing these things to her. She had a flashback of her ex beating her. It's been two weeks and she still thinks I did all of that. I cannot contact her due to being arrested so it'll be a while unfortunately. I've attempted to reach out to her family but no response yet. I'm facing 7-10 years in prison with all the charges the cop/state put on me.

640de1d339ad474bc682f05f	243_ptsd	"Realistic nightmares that don’t end on waking. For the past 4 years, I have been dealing with sleep disturbances related to my PTSD. The one I had tonight has me desperate for help or advice, maybe even just a comment or two from someone who has dealt with similar issues.  

*edit: not being able to sleep has resulted in a lot of googling. Perhaps instead of a nightmare, this is a “
Hypnagogic Hallucination” 


About once a week I am woken up by a “nightmare” (calling it this for lack of a better term.) The nightmare is always brief and is set exactly in my setting (my room, the hotel I’m staying in, etc.) It’s hard to call it a night mare because it occurs as I’m waking from sleep, but in the moment it feels as though I’m waking because of the thing happening in the nightmare. 

For example, tonight I woke with a start and saw a man peeking his head into my bedroom. My door was ajar and I clearly saw a mans face, leaning over and peering into my room. I yelled out (actually yelled, I was awake at this point) “what are you doing?” Or “who are you?” I’m not sure. But I grabbed my phone, dialed 911 and jumped out of bed and turned on the light. It was as I was jumping out of bed I recognized this might be another situation where I was having a nightmare, so I didn’t call 911. But 80% of my brain was still full on functioning as if there was an intruder in my home. I literally went as far as to grab a knife and check every inch of my home. I stood in my entry way with the knife and phone in my hand for a good 10 minutes trying to reason with myself that it wasn’t real. It’s hard to describe how my brain felt so torn. One part of me was constantly aware that it wasn’t real, but there was and is this part of me that can’t shake how real it felt. 

Even now, I am in bed with every light on and I can’t sleep. Logically, nobody is here. But I am terrified and the adrenaline and fight-or-flight dump I just got has me completely freaked out. I’m convinced if I turn off the lights and relax, it will happen again or I was wrong and it was real and I’m about to get murdered. 

I have never had the effect of one of these episodes last this long. Normally they are more vague. I wake to the “knowledge” that someone is there, but I’ve never actually had a full on hallucination. 

Has anyone experienced this? Maybe I need to finally seek professional help. It’s getting out of control.

640de1d339ad474bc682f05f	1163_ptsd	"Two stretches you can do at home that actually help make rage and anxiety go away These things seem dumb and I swear to God I didn't think they'd work, but a therapist I had told me about them and they actually do work.

To stop a feeling of rage: Stand straight with your feet apart. Raise your arms as high as you can above your head, and put your hands together (like people do when they're praying). Stretch as high as you can. Jump and land on the floor, bringing your hands down between your legs, and hold that position for a few seconds.

To lessen anxiety: Roll up in a ball. Put your head down by/between your knees (if you can), and wrap your arms around your legs. Squeeze yourself as hard as you can, try to tense all the muscles in your body that you can. Hold for as long as you can (like 5/10 seconds), then release.

I avoid thinking about them, and I avoid thinking about them. And yet, I can feel they are there in my “soul”.

Not the details, just the broad strokes. I talked to old veteran buddies who were there with me. I even called to start up the therapy. But every time I talked about it, I would feel so much worse.

He is quiet and clean. Good room mate. Likes to talk every now and then.

I honestly don’t think there is much I can do

Hi, so last night I was given an intervention by my new boyfriend, who believes that I have PTSD from a rape that happened several years ago. 
 I have been medically diagnosed with severe depression and an anxiety attack disorder.
This diagnosis came two years after I had been raped at the age of 16 and a virgin too nonetheless. 
At the time I felt as if I had no case so I didn’t report it to my family or the police. Since the attack I’ve struggled heavily with intimacy and trust in men. 
Now I’m 20 years old, a full time university student and far away from my attack but recently I’ve started to deal with some symptoms that I wasn’t used to with my current disorders.
 I’ve started to have nightmares sometimes daily about my attack. It happened in a wooded area very similar to the woods I have to walk through to reach my bus stop for school and I cannot stop dreaming about the men in my life cornering me in those woods. 
Combined with the nightmares I’ve had several episodes of a lover touching my back during sex and I think I had what’s considered a flashback although I’m not very sure. All I know is that it terrifies me. 
My boyfriend believes that I’m struggling with PTSD symptoms due to my attack but I don’t understand why I would have them now 4 years later?? 
Is that even possible? 
I would really appreciate some insight from those who have been diagnosed and wether or not you believe my symptoms hold cause for my to get tested."

**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. 

&amp;#x200B;

***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it.

But I knew that some things were wrong like rotten food, basic rights like phone calls, visitors, and showers being a privilege to be taken away at will.  Or even being denied a doctor or medical tests when my pre existing conditions were acting up. Some things I didn’t notice the extent until later like I didn’t realize how badly I’d been gaslighted and manipulated until the brink of insanity. 


But I didn’t even realize how fucked certain “minor” things were. Like being forced to wake up at 6 am when I got a cold or how I wasn’t allowed to even sleep during “reflection time” which was basically a 3 hour time out style punishment for breaking rules or trash talking the facility, or refusing to eat the expired food. They would take away all my things like books or drawing stuff- anything to occupy the time and I wasn’t allowed to sleep either. They would stand there and poke me telling me “no sleeping” every time I tried to sleep to pass the time.


I was at my weakest when I went there- because I was depressed with a bunch of mental illness but now I still feel so broken. I am angry and sad and I was talking to my grandma yesterday and she was appalled at the things I just thought were minorly shitty. I guess it puts it into perspective.



But my dad still thinks that I’m exaggerating and over reacting because the facility flat out denies most of the stuff, making me seem insane.

5e1ba4f4e8a6633cb7d29344	109_ptsd	"I think i cured my violent sexual trauma and ""fetish"" by getting it to happen to me again. Is this possible? Is it sick? Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it ""rape"" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.


 At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).


I hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be ""real raped, choked"" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.


2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming ""OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP"" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.


Over the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???


TL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick ""fetish"". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."	[]	[{'start': 519, 'end': 571, 'span': 'At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

5e1ba4f4e8a6633cb7d29344	916_ptsd	"Is this PTSD? What do I do? (19 y/o male) About 2 months ago one night  I was delivering a pizza to an apartment building for my job. I left my car door unlocked for convenience when i just walked like 30 steps to the door to deliver it. A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. 
Since then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could’ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I’ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could’ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I’ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don’t really have nightmares.
I just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it’s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I’ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don’t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I’ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I’ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I’m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I’ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I’m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn’t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn’t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don’t want him to think I’m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he’s made it clear before that he doesn’t generally prescribe benzodiazepines. What are my options? I desperately need advice. Sorry for the long and badly structured rant by the way."

5e1ba4f4e8a6633cb7d29344	893_ptsd	"Some thoughts on dissociation? Not sure if this sub is the right place. Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or ""go see a therapist"" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.

Okay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating/introspecting/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.

Either way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.

In particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.

There is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.

Now, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I ""jump into"" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable/offensive that the pain/the other parts could have anything to do with it. 

If that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: ""I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.""

Mind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.

This celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other ""weak needy"" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. 

Outside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.

Now, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and/or ""tricks"" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.

My thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out ""jumping into"" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.

Anyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.

When I was 7 he r*ped me and I didn’t tell my parents until October of 2018...Since then all that has happened it a switch of rooms because he used to have to walk through my room to get to his. He still lives with us because he has high functioning autism and can only really work at a grocery (as he is now). My parents don’t want him to work too much or he will no longer get disability and they’re scared he’ll have a fit at work and get fired even though he’s been working there for like 2 years and been fine.
We don’t have enough money to get him an apartment. My parents don’t think he could survive on his own, so I’m stuck living with him. 
Since I told he doesn’t talk to me or look at me. I do the same towards him. This was until maybe 3 months ago when he had an outburst and screamed at me saying I’m a “junkie lair who should finish what she started and kill yourself” (I used to smoke weed and have attempted suicide before). 
He’s had an outburst like this three times now where he yells at me while I lock myself in another room. Talked to my dad about it and he said unless he sexually touches me or punches me hard (not light shoving) they aren’t going to kick him out.
A week ago I was sleeping on the couch because it’s right by my parents room and makes me feel more sleep. He then went into the living room in the middle of the night and slept in the middle of the floor.
He’s being creepy. He yells at me like once every week and half calling me a lair etc. Being in a house with him without going to school or to friends makes me feel terrible.
I would stay at a friends but my mom has severe COPD so I can’t because of the virus.
I don’t think I can do anything. I’m only allowed to leave the house for a 2 hour walk every other day. I’m unable to function well enough to get my schoolwork done. I feel terrible. I feel unloved by my parents even though I KNOW they love me, but they refuse to do anything! It makes me feel terrible! I don’t want to hurt myself but I almost want to go to a psychward so I don’t have to be here! Or run away and live under a bridge! Or something! I feel so fucking trapped.
If you read all of this please at least comment “that’s fucked up” so I know I’m not crazy for feeling so terrible because my parents are acting like it’s not big deal while also saying they believe me and it’s making me feel nuts. 
Sorry this is so long and badly written. Thank you for reading. Any advice is appreciated. Btw CPS already knows and also did nothing because they couldn’t I guess.

614b9dec59b51fe50763ced0	1035_ptsd	"PTSD coming in waves Im a recovering heroin addict.  I’m still at the beginning stages of dealing with PTSD, stemming from trauma related to my addiction, incarceration, and physical trauma from being hit by a car 7 or 8 years ago on my bike.  
I don’t really want to get into all the details of things that happened to me, or things I witnessed happening to people close to me.  
My reason for coming here is more about what I’m experiencing now.  
I relocated to another state 3 years ago to get treatment and I’ve been off of heroin since I left my home state.  I met my soon to be wife, had a baby and work a good job with benefits.  Everything was getting so much better.
But I left with active warrants in 3 counties and we took a flight back to one of those counties to start taking care of it.   
Pretty much the whole time we were there I was fine.  Saw the judge, explained why I left and let him know I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get this out of the way of my life.  
It went well, but I have two other counties to appear at in the near future.  Everything went better than expected. 
Since we came back home It’s like a switch was flipped and everything feels out of control.  I don’t feel safe anymore.  I don’t know what’s going to happen and I’m having a really hard time coping with the reality that I’ll probably be locked in a cage again at some point. I found myself curled up at the foot of my bed yesterday crying with my entire body convulsing as I remembered very specific events that have taken place over the last 10 years.  
I can’t sleep, I can’t handle my daughter when she cries, I keep flipping out in anger over the smallest triggers.  (Wife burned her hand on a hot plate, screamed in pain, and I flipped out.  Yelling at her and had to leave the house for a walk to cool down.). 
Anyway I’m wondering what I can do to stop myself from emotionally hurting the people I love during this time.  I’m not violent, never physically hurt anyone, but I’m so afraid of ruining the life I’ve built while I learn how to process all of this and move forward.  It’s so strange to me because right now I’m totally fine.  I can think of all the worst memories or possible outcomes and be totally willing to go through it, but my episodes have been triggered so quickly and randomly that I don’t see how I can stop myself in the moment.   
Is it normal to be able to recall memories and be fine with it one day, and then have a completely insane reaction throughout my entire body over the same thoughts another day?   
Again, I’m not worried that I’m going to do any physical damage to anybody, I just don’t want my family to see me like this and remember it for the rest of our lives together.  I don’t want to scare them or cause their own traumas and issues in life because of my inability to rationalize this.  
I have my first emdr session coming up on Thursday and I’m going back to work in the morning so I think that will help.

Feeling anxious, rotten, emotionally unregulated, helpless and hopeless and that no one is helping me. Finally asking and begging for help only to be ridiculed by hospital staff and treated insane. 

I took my charmain hiney to the hospital in a major panic and disassociative episode last night. Can't  sleep because my sleep are nightmares, can function bc I cant sleep. Erupted in an uncontrollable rage and panic last night because of some effed up intrusive and totally unreal thoughts.

I took a Lyft bc i didn't wanna panic my boyfriend and mostly asking for help from anyone in my life or to do something about abuse has never gone well and victim blaming is a thing. You see last year my brother strangled me to unconsciousness and left me for dead. His wife absconded with their kids bc she is a nurse and didnt want to lose her job. They left me in their house to die and when my mom picked me up I was pretty beat up amd she asked me what I did....lol...All for bringing his wife home 10 minutes too late (he hates himself and her and has alway always wanted me dead bc I took everything from him...you know by not doing drugs and studying and earning scholarships for college sure seems unfair.) Cuckoo.

Sitting there, naked in a robe, zoned tf out with tears down my cheeks and a bag of piss sample, I could just see and hear nurses making rude gestures. It was empty in the ER and the only time I've ever felt unsafe for myself, i couldnt even feel safe there. I finally asked to be seen, they ignored me. They took all my belongings and phone and i just needed to call my fiance to pick me up bc i could feel a huge trigger (sweating profusely, rapid talk, hypervigilant). I said i really didn't want to be there so unless they're checking me in, ill go. A dude  nurse walks by and laughs ""good, go then""......uhm all I saw was red. That's alllllll it took for me to cuss him out, threaten litigation, speak to their head staff and demand my belongings and to tell me ""tell me how tf do you act when your brother tries to kill you and you lose the only kids youl ever have niece and nephew"". They were in the wrong and the security staff apologized as did the doctor. Doesnt matter, i wont be seeking help from the er ever again and i get to deal with the embarassment of losing my shit thinking im a victim again. Ughh.

I prob needed 72 hrs. Thats what i wanted. 

About me:  Im 37 years old and was diagnosed in 2017 with PTSD. A history of child physical and sexual abuse, extreme poverty, absentee parents , extreme bullying and racial prejudice from whites and blacks bc I am mixed, an emotionally abusive and cheating gay ex husband, watching friends die in front of me, painful endometriosis, bullying at work, physical attacks and most recently my brother tried to kill me.

Spent all of my life ignoring the effed upness of everything because being alienated or told your different sure makes you not wanna put on anything but a happy face...until my body and brain broke, which happened one night outside of a club in 2017 when a black woman threw me to the ground and choked me because i walked by her and  apparently thought I was ""just some cute lightskinned girl."" After, i went into a dissociation and been stuck in it since.

You see, i can write all those things down now but those are things no one knew of me. I am smart, educated, used to be kind, and definitely goofy/quick witted. My kindness has often been easy for manipulative people to exploit and since speaking up didnt work as a child, I just laughed about everything....the manager whos wife sent me nudes and tried to groom me for a threesome outta nowhere, the other manager who hated me because I excelled at what I did and ridiculed and alienated me from staff, the perverts who knew i was naive to men, etc...

I was raised by a narcissistic physically and verbally abusive mother and sister.  An emotionally absent, verbally abusive father.  I suffered sexual abuse by I don't know who all.  I know it was older kids in the neighborhood, but I have long thought there was an adult involved as well.  I am an HSP and have severe OCD.

I read this forum, and the CPTSD forum, and it seems most avoid sex.  I avoid romantic sex, but the crazier and kinkier it is the more I want it.  If I am ""making love"" with my wife I can't stand it.  I feel weird, and usually cannot complete the session.  If it's a kink fest, the weirder the better, it's the best sex ever.

I have always been that way.  In my teen and early adult years I would have sex with anyone, any sex.  Made life difficult in the 80's in the deep south.  But I was known to make you feel friggin' amazing.

But it seems to all boil down to I have to be giving others pleasure.  My own is not even a consideration for me.  My pleasure is in debasing myself to whatever level to make whoever I am with have amazing sex.  My germaphobic OCD is probably the only reason I haven't had anything worse than chlamydia.

She met one guy years ago and fell in love.  He passed away a few years back.  She lost the love of her life and the one man she trusted in that way.  She is still very much hurt and stuck on that.

So now I come in.  I am a very sensitive person.  I cherish the little things.  I listen and im attentive to my partner.  She isnt used to that.  She fell for me really hard and quick.  I tried to hold her back but I gave in and was all in love and happy.  

Then we had a couple fights stemming from my own insecurities and hers along with the situation we are in the one of her sons fathers.  (!Hes constantly trying to get back with her and she cant just stop talking to him bc her child lives with him currently).

After these fights that to me were nothing to ruin a relationship, she starts backing off.  She decides she wants to use protection and not have my kids now and came out of the blue with it and that hurt.  Then she didnt want me going to her kids school stuff. 

I went from being able to talk to this girl about anything and touch her whenever I want, all the way to she wont touch me and she wont talk to me without being cold and defensive.

I didnt understand anything and I was getting hurt by all this.  I do alot for her and she knows that.  I never hold it over her at all.  I just want the intimacy and relationship back that we had.

Finally the other day we had the biggest fight and everything was on the table.  I felt used and lied to.  I felt hurt by what was happening.  I've given her my all and I thought we were in love.  

For some reason she finally said something that helped me understand that it wasnt me.  It's not that she isnt attracted to me.  It's not that she doesnt love me.  She is dealing with something in her head that she isnt ready to tell me or cant even describe.

I'm pretty new to the idea of me having PTSD, since I always thought of PTSD in the context of war/physical harm. However, in the past two years, I think I've pinpointed that my emotional issues stem from a specific incidence of trauma from when I was a kid, but I'm doubting if this memory was actually 'traumatic enough'. 

When I was around 7 years old, I had a pet parakeet. My older brother, around 14 at the time, offered me a quarter if he could have my her. In my mind, since we lived in the same house, he could have the bird but she would still be here in the house, so it didnt matter. I don't remember much of the events that happened after that moment, but I remember that he had had a friend over and they were joking around. Anyways, we had the kind of glass windows that shut closed. At some point, my brother put the bird in the windowsill and smashed the glass slider against her, basically killing her violently. 

I believe I suppressed this memory, or blocked out most of it, since I don't remember much of what happened afterwards. 

I'm making this post because I have told only one person in my life about this situation, and while she is incredibly supportive and helpful with my emotional issues, I still feel in the back of my mind that this /isn't/ PTSD, and my issues don't stem from this experience at all. 

For the entirety of my life, I have felt an extreme, often paranoid fear of people close to me hurting me physically or even killing me. I am currently seeing a wonderful guy, but I feel like I have PTSD glasses on and am searching obsessively for signs that he's a sociopath. This obsessive fear, of someone close to me turning out to be a sociopath/someone who will violently hurt me, has been a ever present theme in my life, and I am wondering if this worry is directly caused by the experience with the bird, or if it's coming from something else.

When i was nine... my mom decided to divorce from my dad... in most cases it wouldn’t be too bad... in this case it was different... this entire shit storm caused my diagnosed PTSD. I faced my dad getting destroyed by my mom in every way possible... from my dad having to sleep in his car to my mom who aways said my dad was a demon... from the most horrible things you could imagine... my mom wrote a letter to her lawyer stating that my dad “beat us” “Physically abused us” and “mentally abused us” my mom is delusional, She has mental health issues...  Because of this she only sees her own reality instead of the actual reality... now skipping ahead... when i was 12 my mom kicked me out of her house because her new boyfriend who moved in with us almost immediately hated kids... He played her in such a way that my mom started hating us. A couple of weeks later when i moved in with my dad.. My sister still lived at my mom’s. my sister had enough of being isolated from the people and family she had been with her entire life.. so she said “mom i wan’t to go to dad to see my brothers...” my mom took this as a sign of her wanted to move into with my dad’s as well... when they dropped her off there was a giant hassle between my dad and my mom’s boyfriend... her boyfriend pulled out a pickaxe (i know right what the fuck) and threatened my dad. I proceed to calling the police and they show up... we got Youth counseling at the end but that didn’t work as planned... they damage had been dealt and still to this day me and my mom are rivals.. she’s a delusional alcoholic who lost her mind. I’m currently in therapy to get trough this mess... i still see the frames of the fights, abuse, and suffering i had to deal with, with such a young age... anyway... thanks if you made it this far... you guys are awesome❤️"	[]	[{'start': 110, 'end': 144, 'span': 'witnessing a death and being raped', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 262, 'end': 442, 'span': 'When i was nine... my mom decided to divorce from my dad... in most cases it wouldn’t be too bad... in this case it was different... this entire shit storm caused my diagnosed PTSD', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 919, 'end': 1044, 'span': 'when i was 12 my mom kicked me out of her house because her new boyfriend who moved in with us almost immediately hated kids.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}, {'start': 1475, 'end': 1664, 'span': 'giant hassle between my dad and my mom’s boyfriend... her boyfriend pulled out a pickaxe (i know right what the fuck) and threatened my dad.

It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

I've had PTSD for a while. I was assaulted as a child, by my cousin, then again at 11 by my boyfriendwho was 16, and again at 14 by a different boyfriend. I never told anyone, even my therapists, I was ""normal"" in my eyes, because until two years ago some of the incidents never resonated as an assault. I was conditioned to think they were normal things that teen girls do with or for the older men in their lives. My therapist knew though, I think. They're trained to know, especially when a young kid is edging around certain subjects like their love life or past boyfriends.

Well, a friend who knew me and my first boyfriend (the one who assaulted me at 11), has recently started hanging out with him again after years of no connection. He's apparently VERY different now, but she doesn't know that he assaulted me. She keeps pressuring me into going to their friend's house to hang out, she keeps texting me funny things he's said to her, and I woke up early this morning read a text from her about him and fell back asleep because it was early. 

I had a TERRIBLE nightmare, I woke up and didnt even remember where I was. I won't go into details, but it SEVERELY affected me. I dont know what I want to do, I want to run away and stay put. I want to cry and I want to brush it off. I dont know what to do, because i never played into the PTSD. I didnt want my siblings or parents to know, i didnt want anyone to know. I never told anyone about that diagnosis and now? I wish i had.

This same friend also dated the other boyfriend who assaulted and stalked me (for four years, as a minor, he was an adult). I'm open about the stalking, I told her when she asked me, but I never told her about the assault. We worked together and he would wait for her (she worked in the back mostly, I worked in the front of the restaurant), but he always watched me. Always did things to make me jump, like leaving so I'd be comfortable and wait for me to relax, then he'd reappear. 

I was fine until I wasn't, and it feels like today was a breaking point. I feel scared and angry. And like no one will understand. 'Why didnt I speak up before?' 'Why didnt I tell anyone?' And I'm just scared. I dont even want a hug, or someone to hold my hand, I dont want anything. I just went to my room instead of taking a hike like I wanted and started hyperventilating, I cried. Like I never have before. 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I can't find anywhere else to put it. I just wanna throw up and hide. Am I overreacting? Is this all in my head?

Anyways, best wishes all, stay safe and occupied during this stressful time."

I’m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. 
I totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn’t do anything. 
I had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn’t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don’t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.
I’m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can’t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can’t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. 
I also watched the worst accident I’ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I’d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn’t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn’t ok to drive. 
So.. yea. I don’t really know where I was going with this, I guess I’m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they’re doing better now. 
I don’t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can’t even do those things.
I’m trying so hard. I just feel like it’s pointless sometimes. 

Anyway if you read this super long post..
Thank you. It feels nice to finally be able to have a voice."

Without getting too into her past experiences, she was emotionally abused and made to do sexual favors, and then stalked by the human garbage. This happened about 4-5 years ago and she sill has trust issues and emotional issues because of it. I am new to relationships, I've only had one long term relationship before this for two years and it ended abruptly and suddenly. Because of that I also am insecure with relationships and I was not sure if she actually liked me for a while. She does but she has a hard time showing it, and I've accepted that because I really like her. She has a hard time expressing herself to me which is fine but a little frustrating because I don't have much of a filter and I say what I feel to her.

She refuses to get help. She won't see a therapist and she won't take medication because she doesn't want to depend on it her whole life. She saw a therapist initially but it made the anxiety and depression worse leading to a suicide attempt, so she won't try again. I keep telling her she needs to talk to someone if not me, or try meds but she won't budge. 

Also, occasionally she will get very defensive with me about seemingly very random things, which does tend to lead to fights because it makes me upset and then she gets upset because of that. What should I do when this happens? She also never apologizes for doing it, which is also a little frustrating because it makes me feel bad, like I did something to upset her(enter, insecurity). 

 All of this being said, I have a few questions.

How do I help her get help? What can I do?

Will she ever open up to me? I see glimpses of her true self every now and then but I want to know everything about her, and it's frustrating that I can't.

If anyone would like to share experiences of dating someone with ptsd I'd love to hear them. Or if you suffer from ptsd I'd love to hear firsthand about these questions or the troubles we are having. I really want to make this work and I do really like her. Besides all of this, she really Is my dream girl and I find her incredibly attractive.

Shortly before, he told me he wanted a divorce. He has four other children, three of which are from his first wife. He decided to end that marriage when his youngest was an infant. The children do not have a good relationship with him now. He has another child from a woman he was dating. He decided he didn't want to be with her anymore when the child was an infant.    It seems to me that there is a pattern. He easily detaches from relationships at the same time in the child's life but wants a relationship with them when they are older. I've tried to research online, but I'm not getting any answers.

I'm in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. I have recently begun talking to my family again over email after avoiding contact for a year as I needed to distance myself from them. I have a great deal of trauma attached to my birth name which I no longer use and they put very little effort into understanding this and not using it when talking to or about me. I also have trauma associated with my upbringing and my family's behaviour to me as a child.

The conversations were over email and it felt as if they had begun to be more understanding of this. Recently my Mother came to visit me and after about an hour into her being here, I noticed I had begun to feel extremely nauseous, very anxious and uncomfortable, to the point where I really struggled to focus and maintain socialising for the rest of the day and for the rest of her visit. I had a really hard time falling asleep because these feelings did not subside and instead had gotten worse, leaving me up overthinking to the point of crying and feeling like I needed to throw up as if I had something stuck in my throat.

Even though they have not purposefully me any wrongdoing and that I still love them as family, I feel as if I would be putting myself through more than it is worth and more than I can deal with if I continued keeping in contact with them. I feel great deals of guilt when considering cutting them out of my life but I honestly don't know if there is a better option at this point other than doing this and seeing a therapist.

People say that you are meant to remove from your life things that are triggering for past trauma, but what do you do when this trigger is a person, especially a family member or members?

I am really stuck here, sometimes I feel as if I am being over sensitive and nasty about this, but other times I feel justified and this is the right thing to do for myself.

5c371dd21ede2b0001152915	1220_ptsd	"A poem about my experience. Hi everyone,

I've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. 

I developed PTSD as a consequence. I mentioned to my therapist that I like writing, and she suggested I write poetry about the experience. So I thought I would share this poem with you all. This week has been particularly hard for me, and I think writing this poem has helped a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The World was a Different Place.** 

*A demon laughed* 

*at me while I* 

*begged my Father not to fire.*

*The lights were off.*

*Alone in the dark,*

*I battled the night.*

*The world was a Different place there.* 

*The womb of reality burst*

*when the gun fired and an*

*ungodly scream*

*came through me*

*and my Father swayed,*

*a tortured tranquility in him*

*before he fell to the ground.*

*The pitch black pistol*

*falling into the chair beside his body,*

*aimed down to the hell*

*that possessed him.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*Grabbing the gun,*

*sliding it to the other room,*

*screaming for help.*

*All in seconds,*

*desperately racing to beat the clock*

*of my Father’s mortal life.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades*

*Blood leaked across the floor*

*oozing into the carpet, through my jacket*

*on my shirt, my jeans, and hands.* 

*Cradling my Father, I whispered to him,*

*“I’m here. It’s gonna be okay. I’m here.”*

*A ghost looked back at me.* 

*The world was a different place there.* 

*The memory fades.* 

*My phone buzzed- a text from the stranger who let me in.*

*“Can you leave?”*

*“No- he shot himself.”*

*The phone rang. I answered.* 

*“You have to come outside. The police won’t come in till you come out.”*

*My mission incomplete.*

*My breath quickened, I looked to my Father again,*

*trying to hear his final words.*

*The world was a Different place there.*

*The memory fades.*

*I could not leave him,*

*And yet- my legs carried me to my feet*

*and out the door to a different place.*

*I walked down stairs.*

*I entered the garage.*

*Police lights everywhere.*

*A voice screamed, “He has blood on his hands!”*

*My arms raised, guns drawn on me.*

*I heard my own voice screaming.*

*“Help him please, he shot himself, dear God help him!”*

*I felt myself walk through the garage doors.*

*Patted down, handcuffed, pushed against a wall.*

*The handcuffs grated sharply against my skin*

*But no one there to feel them.*

*I could not breathe; the spirit had left me*

*an empty husk alone in the desolate place*

*where God could not be.* 

*The world was a different place there.*

*The memory fades.* 

*Police asked where his office was.*

*I could not say, could not remember.*

*My heart fell.*

*I could not remember. I could not remember.*

*Why could I not remember?*

*Why could I not remember*

*when it was my Father dying?*

*The world was a different place there.*

*Sitting on a curb, the wind howling, the skies grey.*

*The blood, dried and caked on my hands.*

*Staring wordlessly at it.*

*A deafening silence*

*interrupted by police officers speaking to me.*

*I heard and I responded*

*the anguish, the heartbreak, the injustice.*

*I could not contain it, the story could not be held.*

*I begged the police to let me clean it off.*

*I heard an apology, but the blood remained.* 

*Rain will wash the blood away instead.* 

*Images and sounds and faces came and went.*

*But no one witnessed them.*

*Pictures, fingerprints, DNA, taken.*

*Questions and questions and questions*

*In the car, headed to the trauma center.*

I struggle a lot with wanting to die. It's all very passive. But like still there, ya know? 

At first, I was going through the motions of therapy, medication, etc. to get better for myself, I just want to feel better. That's what I thought, though. I don't know if I ever truly believed that. I've made progress, that's something not even I deny. But my motivation for anything has just been plummeting for months now. I feel momentary horrible anxiety about consequences, but ultimately I feel like I don't have consequences. 

Maybe, because I don't see a future for myself. Or maybe because I didn't see myself living past eighteen, so I don't know how to see a future for myself. It's all just speculation, really. 

The trauma I felt, the abuse that was done to me, it destroyed me as a person. I have come to realize that the person I was before my abuse...I can never get her back. She is now a ghost. I don't know who I am anymore. I don't who this person is, I don't know whose body I'm staying in. My trauma...it's been like my birth. I hate it. I hate it so much, but...I can't do anything about it. I don't even know if it's worth going back to who I was before. 

I think I have different hobbies I want to pursue, and I think I have a different favorite color. My favorite flowers are different, but my least favorite foods will always be the same. 

My body seems to remember my old self, but my brain does not, cannot. And I don't think I want to push it. I think, just like you do with a kid, I'm going to let it figure out who this new person is. 

But for the time, I have no hopes for this person. I have no foreseeable consequences...or more so, I just can't feel them beyond that insane instantaneous anxiety. But I don't like putting the people I love through this. Just because I don't see much potential for myself, doesn't mean I don't see futures for anyone else. 

So is it okay, while I'm trying to figure out this new person that I am, that I just get better for my hamsters? My lovely dog? My parents? My boyfriend? 

My boyfriend...I want to get better for him the most. I love him so much. But he tells me the same things everyday about what I need to do, and he tries so hard, and I know he is so tired. 

Is it unhealthy to try and get healthy for these things in my life? At least for now? I want to do it for myself eventually, but how do I get to that point?"

I experienced CSA growing up and have only begun to unpack it now in my 20s so it has been pretty distressful for me. I am still dealing with it pretty hard, but usually, I can get a handle on it. Today I was triggered by a movie I was watching and I ended up having a full-blown episode where I had a meltdown and felt like I had to go out to some random bar or dangerous neighborhood and willingly seek out and put myself into another ""sexual assult-y"" situation in order to cope with my overwhelming feelings. This has happened to me many times before so I knew I needed to just stay put and let the feelings pass. I did and eventually, the unbearable urge to put myself at risk went away.

But then I felt so much shame, so so so much shame. I was so shocked at my reaction it's like something came over me to try to seek out such a dangerous situation (I guess my mind is trying to make me act out the trauma again). I also figure I had to stay put in bad sexual situations as a child so my brain thinks I need to do that to survive now as an adult. I'm trying to practice self-kindness and talk about the original traumatic events in therapy, but it still is so overwhelming to go through.

i was molested by my father as an adolescent. my memory is pretty murky so i can only approximate my age--i think i was 10-13. around that same time i ending up perusing encyclopedia dramatica and similar pages a lot, looking at content that would be inappropriate for any person ever, let alone a young, hurting, isolated child. i've seen about every shock image from the 2005-2010 internet era. i've read awful stories about rape, murder, pedophilia, et cetera. i've seen awful pornography--about anything you can imagine, just barely legal. i've seen videos of people dying. and most of this i saw before high school. 

i've not told anyone about this. one of my good friends in high school was also into this stuff, but we're no longer close and i don't know if he similarly feels traumatized now or not. i am going to speak to my therapist about it next time we meet. i've only really acknowledged it as a problem to myself lately, but now that it's reared its head the emotional turmoil is very painful to bear. i am not comfortable telling my friends--only one of them even knows i was molested, and that she only knows because we were drunk and she told me she was as well. i feel sad, disgusted, ashamed, angry. i wish i could go back to my younger self and do what none of the adults that were supposed to help did--let me know that i was and am not a freak, or a monster, or a predator.

i still struggle with that now. despite not having seen this stuff for close to a decade, i still see those images sometimes when i close my eyes. i sought them out at the time, so i also feel foolish for retroactively being traumatized. most victims don't willingly waltz into the arms of trauma, but i did, countless times over several years. it's affected my sex life (or lack thereof), my self-confidence (i've seen how nasty people can be on the internet, and i always knew that i was only a hair's breadth away from being targeted myself), my ability to connect with others, blah blah.

5c371dd21ede2b0001152915	1265_ptsd	"Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. 

Going to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. 

I was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.

I dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. 

I dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.

Honestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.

I feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. 

It's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. 

But still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. 

I'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.

I know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. 

**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks. I have a therapist appointment on friday, but a recent appointment with my psychiatrist, where he absently dismissed a diagnosis of PTSD as being 'purely academic' has me nervous about bringing it up with my therapist."

5c371dd21ede2b0001152915	739_ptsd	"I freaked out over a birthday gift. Can books be triggering? Two years ago my boyfriend gave me a play that means a lot to him. He said a lot of it reminds him of me, but the thing is, a lot of the play has to do with mental illness. 

I do have PTSD, and it was a lot worse then than it is now, but I never wanted to define myself by it. I did hallucinate sometimes, and when it got really bad I'd even hide under the table, but I'm not proud of those moments, and it's much easier to deal with life if I move on and try not to think about how crazy I look while having a flashback. 

So it was pretty upsetting to realise that maybe he sees me primarily as someone who is mentally ill. It doesn't help that the character who reminds him of me is told to shut up and quit whining. But my boyfriend wasn't comfortable with me giving it away, saying that someday he'd like his own copy. So I kept it for two years and tried not to think about it. 

Yesterday we took everything off the bookshelves, and as soon as I saw the play, all those old feelings came back. I felt as if giving me this play was a message that I don't hate myself enough. That character was like a caricature of me at my worst moments, and as I'm recovering pretty well, I'd like to put that behind me. I tried to give the play to my boyfriend, but he looked sad and insisted that it was a gift from him to me. 

He explained that the play was so special that he didn't even show it to some of his best friends. He thought it was one of the most thoughtful gifts possible, from anyone, and that he believed I was clever enough to appreciate it as he does. Also, when I saw myself in that character, I'd realise that all my painful thoughts are just words, and then they'll stop hurting me. And lastly, he told me to get rid of the play, but after hearing all this, I feel so guilty and absolutely despise myself. 

All the same, there were lines like ""You can only kill yourself if you're not already dead"" and ""No one can hate me more than I hate myself"". The author was someone who lived with pain and was used to it, and she did commit suicide. I was going to counselling in order to stop feeling suicidal. I was trying to do anything possible not to be mentally ill, and this gift felt like a slap in the face. It still does, but I wonder, is my feeling justified at all?

Usually comments like these I just roll my eyes at but today it became a huge trigger. My mind went back to my ex and everything he did and for the first time in 4 years since it happened I realized I was raped. I've been lying to myself, making excuses for him, rewriting the memories in my head, trying to find any way around that word. I would say ""sexual abuse"" and ""coersion"" to minimalize what happened. ""he loved me, he didn't realize what he was doing was wrong"". This morning I suddenly remember the probably hundreds of conversations I had telling him no means no and that it wasn't ok what he was doing. He acknowledged, apologized, then said I was just too irresistible and he can't control himself at all when he's turned on, it isn't him, his dick is the one in full control.

Post break up he was desperate to have his victim back. When to great lengths, more than he ever did in the almost 2 years we were together. He did something nice I was extremely grateful for then he sat himself outside my door until I let him come ""cuddle"". He swore he wouldn't try anything, he just wanted some cuddles. I had been up for 48 hrs, anxiety was at a high, I had no strength. He stayed outside begging me for an hour, keeping me awake, until I gave in. I passed out quickly to wake up to him trying to have sex with me. I pretended I was asleep and prayed for it to stop and it never did. He then kissed me on the forehead like it was a consensual thing he did. I'm still pretending to be asleep.

For years I have lied to myself on this situation. I minimalized, excused, told myself he was young and didn't know better (we were 17-18 at the time), anything to make it not happen. I've checked on his social media ever since to make sure he hasn't been dating anyone. He still tries to twist the whole relationship like he wasn't a great bf but we had some great times.

I'm married and in a healthy relationship with someone who respects my boundaries and I constantly worry he's going to do it someone else.

It's just really hard when your brain finally shows you the truth after hiding it for so long.. I remembered what he said but had warped what i told him just to make myself feel like he just didn't understand or know. But he did. He knew. He understood what he was doing. I sat and broke down countless times and he would say his magic words then repeat the cycle.

Sorry for the long ass story, I just.... It took me 2 years to admit the sexual abuse, and another 2 for this.. I'm still having a really hard time saying the word out loud because if I do it solidifies it so I guess I'm typing it out as a next best thing.

I hope the post works this time.
I hope that some of you can relate and that it brings a bit of hope, among all the anger that infects us.

Dear Tom
It's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.

I wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.

Peace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that.

I also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask ""how's school?"", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than ""good"" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.

So you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be ""normal"", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be ""normal"" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what ""normal"" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness.

The affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger.

I have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.

My anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say ""What's wrong with you?"". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.

My depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.

Since my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come.

I'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well.

You have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect.

You used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line ""you're destroying this family"" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted.

But now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said ""you're destroying the family""; what you meant was something different. ""Family"" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, ""Family"" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was ""you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear"" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me.

You'd also say ""I put a roof over your head"". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. ""I did my job, so now you owe me"". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the ""family"".

You aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.

I could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle. As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The ""zig-zag"" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom.

Words can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that ""my kid is dying"" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.

You might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your ""gifts"". The toys were a way of saying ""sorry I bashed your head the other day"", or maybe ""please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute"". The car was a way of saying ""please disappear"". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was ""destroying the family"" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a ""bad investment"" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple ""grudge"" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your ""gifts"".

Sometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. ""Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years"", ""nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?"", ""nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?"", ""nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?"". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in ""raising"" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and ""destroy the family"".

Another inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day.

I tried to explain what it was like to be ""raised"" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.

Moving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.

I'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.

On days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me.

I think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now.

It's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.

This letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to ""destroy the family""."

5c371dd21ede2b0001152915	522_ptsd	"What is wrong with me? Do I have PTSD? Hello,  

I’m a 25 year old woman that turns 26 in exactly two weeks, and I couldn’t fathom being anymore depressed than I am now. When I was 14 and a new sophomore in high school , I met this 22 year old man (I’ll call him The Man) via my friend who was 14 as well. At the time I didn’t know how old he was and he and my friend’s sister (16) were dating. Somehow, the man got my phone number and consistently and persistently texted me until I stopped ignoring him and began texting back. 

I didn’t like him at first, but after weeks of texting nonstop, my 14 year old self somehow fell for him. I knew he was involved with my friend’s sister, and it ate me alive, but I also had feelings for him. One day, when my mom wasn’t home, I invited him over for the first time. We met at my neighborhood pool, and we sat in his car and talked in person for about an hour. When it was time for me to leave, he wrestled with me for about 10 mins trying to kiss me, and when I finally submitted, the only thing I could say was that his breath smelled. He left, and we continued to text. 

A week later, my friend’s sister (who was in my orchestra class) gave me a note basically cursing me out for “kissing her man” and calling me a fat slut, which hurt because although I’m no where near obese, I’ve always struggled with my weight, and she knew that. I crumpled the paper up and threw it at her telling her that he has been persistently pursuing me. It was a big thing and I almost got kicked out of class. I was really hurt, but I knew I was wrong. I texted him and asked him why he told her, and he said he didn’t want to keep a secret from her, and that he couldn’t see me anymore. I was extremely hurt and didn’t really understand what had happened. He began to ignore me, but would sometimes call me and leave messages about how sorry he was. This all took place around this time this year, the fall. 

I fell into a depression, being that this was my first romantic encounter, and it was so negatively toxic, I didn’t know what to think or do. I stopped eating and lost a bunch of weight. Being that I couldn’t talk to anyone about this, my family thought I had developed an eating disorder. This lasted a couple months. Then in December, around Christmas break, I started getting prank phone calls. They would call about twice a day, and after about a week, the person came clean and turns out it was The Man.  He told me that he and my friend’s sister ended things because her mom found out about their relationship. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. Elated, I told him I loved him too and agreed to being in a relationship with him. 

When school started back in January, he would come over after school every Wednesday. My single mom worked a lot, and I took advantage of that. We happily “dated” for exactly a month, until one day, he told me that my friend’s sister wanted him back and wanted to work on their relationship. He also told me that while they were dating, they were sexually involved, something that he was not getting from me. He began breaking up with me saying that she was first. I was distraught. I thought that giving him what she could give him, would make him stay with me. While crying, I told him I would have sex with him. He decided to take me up on that offer. I told him I was scared and asked him if it would hurt and he said it would. He laid me down, and told me to open my legs. I was crying and scared, so he forced them open. I don’t remember it actually happening, but I do remember after it happened, he told me to tell him that he broke me. I told him that he broke me, and he left, not changing his mind about ending things. I cried all night. 

He continued to text me, and see me even while dating the sister. We would have sex, and my attachment to him became really deep, scary deep. About 2 months later, I snuck out in the middle of the night to meet him in my neighborhood and I got caught by the police. The police also found him, but let him go. They brought me home and told my mom. She was livid. She told me that she was pressing charges. She called me a slut and a whore and took my phone. I found a way to contact him and told him what was going on. My mom contacted him and wanted to meet up with him. I don’t know what that meeting looked like or how it went but they met, and afterwards, he told me he couldn’t talk to me anymore, and my mom didn’t press charges. 

About a year later, I received an email from him saying he missed me. Our secret relationship started up again, but this time it was a bit different. His twin brother was dating this 17 year old girl that I went to school with, so naturally, the girl and I became friends to be each other’s cover. We would all hangout together and one time we all were in the same bed and having sex, but not with each other. I met some of his other siblings and had to lie about my age when they said I looked so young. He would also give me alcohol. There was a time that I went on a weekend trip with him and his brother to visit their friend (24). We stayed at the Friend’s house who was celebrating his girlfriend of 6 years’ birthday. It was a big celebration because she was finally turning 18. The Man had friends like him and even his twin brother was like him. About a week later, I found out that he gave me chlamydia and when I told him about it, and that he was the only guy I’ve ever been with, he denied it and said that I must’ve gotten it from a toilet seat or something. Somehow, my entire high school found out that I had an std. I don’t know how, but I continued to date him. On the same date that he broke up with me the year before, he broke up with me again, stating that I was too young. He still continued to see me and have sex with me, just without the title of being in a relationship with me. This allowed him to see other people, which I didn’t understand. 

About 2 weeks later, my mom found out and this time actually pressed charges. She took me to talk to a detective and I remember hating her for that. I didn’t tell the detective everything but I told him some things and that I loved him. The Man decided to turn himself in and I didn’t talk to him again after that. My mom was extremely mad at me for months. I knew she was disappointed in me, and every chance she got, she let me know. 

When I started my senior year of high school, things were a lot more normal. My mom was trusting me again, and even got me a car. I had a boyfriend that was my age, that she approved of. One day, at a Friday high school football game, I saw The Man. I was there with my boyfriend and avoided The Man. He stared at me and watched me. When the game ended, he texted me and said that he sees I moved on. I said yeah. 

The case against him was still going on. A few months passed and he contacted me begging me to ask my mom to drop the charges because he was facing 20 years. I told him that I would talk to her. He then asked me to marry him and said that if I marry him, the charges would automatically drop and that he could get us an apartment. He said we could start a family and that he would take care of us. I seriously thought about it, and then declined. I told my mom that he contacted me and she was mad at me. A few months later, I found out that she worked out a deal to bring his sentencing down to him being on probation for 10 years and being on the sex offender’s list for 3 years. 

At the time, my teenage self moved on from the situation very quickly. However when I turned 25 last year, all the memories and emotions I suppressed hit me like a ton of bricks. Ever since I was 16, my body has been sick. I have acne all over my body, irregular periods, mood swings, regular yeast infections and vaginal infections and have had terribly toxic relationships with men. I think that every guy I encounter has given me an STD. For the last two years, and being sexually active once out of those two years, I have been trying to convince myself that I do not have HIV even after testing negatively several times. I’m starting to believe I’m traumatized. 

 I always feel like I have to please any male I encounter, and that I need to work hard and give him everything I have to avoid him leaving me. I’m overtly sexual and think that I must be a pornstar in order to receive love from the male kind however, I don’t really know what intimacy is. 

I don’t have healthy relationships at all. If I befriend a female, after a couple months, I cut her off and stop talking to her. 

I have dreams of being a doctor, but now think that I’m incapable of achieving something like that. My confidence is shot, and I hate myself. 

I feel guilty for The Man having to spend nearly all of his 20s on probation. I hate myself for being such a fast and loose little girl. I hate what I did to my mom and my sister. 

I still live at home, in the same bedroom where all of this took place and it’s starting to swallow me whole. I’ve been having flashbacks of what happened and I hate myself for that.

 I don’t know who I am anymore and I’m scared to interact with people or even exist on this planet. Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I’m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don’t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. 

Im in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I’ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I’ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can’t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I’ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I’m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I’m always alone and always will be. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do."

(TW: Abuse/Sexual Assault) I grew up in a very neglectful, borderline abusive household and, as a teenager ended up in a situation where I was being regularly assaulted by an acquaintance/family friend. I feared for my life (my abuser was becoming increasingly violent) and for my future (my family was refusing me access to college resources). This whole situation culminated in me leaving home at 17 and moving across the country. The year following my leaving was really hard. I didn't think that I would be able to go to college at all (where I'd gotten in, I couldn't afford it) and was struggling to support myself/with my mental health.

This year, I got a full scholarship to a wonderful school and I'm so incredibly excited! It's everything I've ever wanted, but at the same time, I think that the stress of the upcoming change (I move in three weeks) is already making my PTSD symptoms worse. I know that I'm going to be away from my significant other and my dog, who really help me to cope. Plus, I'm going to be forced to be around people a lot more. My paranoia and nightmares have been increasing, and the other night I even had a flashback, which I haven't had in a long time.

TLDR: I'm worried about dealing with PTSD and the college transition at the same time, and would really appreciate any advice or insight."

So long story short, i’ve had more smaller events of sexual abuse starting when I was 12, possibly earlier, with a very neglectful and toxic mother and family. I had a bigger trauma when I was 16 where i got dragged out of a car and let in the middle of nowhere. It wasn’t until I was 20 I got the diagnosis of PTSD (also bipolar) after years of trying to figure out what was wrong with me. I started going to therapy, but the prolonged exposure didn’t work. I didn’t want to do it, because it just made me uncomfortable. I have panic attacks and the fear and real emotions come when I don’t expect it at home, but i was never able to get any emotions out in therapy. I couldn’t even really have full memories of the main traumas. My therapist always tried to get me to cry and break down but i never could. I eventually just gave up and stopped going because i started feeling better. He was confused and thought i was running because we didn’t do any real PE work. I feel fine but my husband also thinks i’m running from it.

So I’ve had severe PTSD for years, everything from a life threatening illness, watching a week old baby being revived back to life, to abuse and  a victim of assault. We recently had a major incident at my workplace that resulted in some of my close coworkers being very seriously injured, and one of our clients being arrested. I wasn’t actually present at the time it happened, but I was there in the aftermath to clean things up, and help others figure out the rest of their schedules for the week. I feel awful for feeling traumatized, but at the same time, I left only moments before the incident occurred and it happened very close to my office. The room reeked of old blood and the atmosphere felt tense and scary. I never thought my work family and I would go through something like this.

6658c7a03d9792782e2640be	655_ptsd	"Online gore can destroy you. I brought this to myself. I might be the most stupid man I know.. I'm sorry, it'll be a long story.

The first thing I remember being related to this would be when I was 11. I ended up with a picture of an 18yo corpse, in midst of the most disgusting putrefaction. I'd never dared to imagine that was what was coming to me when I'll end up dead. Of course, you can imagine it traumatized me. I couldn't sleep for weeks, I was terrified of the dark and this picture haunted me, forced itself into my mind and I saw it literally everywhere.

It sounds stupid. I know. It gets worse.

I developed, what I understood way later, something called as necrophobia. I realized it when my mother died 2 years ago. I barely mourned her, or maybe I did but in a really quiet and subtle way I still do not understand. I couldn't show up to her burying. It was definitely impossible. I just said goodbye to her while she was getting medicated and ran off when they decided to euthanize her. I couldn't get to see her for the last time as something that terrifies me. I just couldn't. I can't describe it. There was no way.

Yet.. something did change. I changed.. a bit. I developed a close relationship to death. Not in a way that makes me want to join her. But a sense of morbidity and nihilism I did not know I had. 

It developed further as I wanted to confront myself. To make these flashes stop. Just like I did when I was terrified of bees. I decided to confront my fears, to watch death in front of my very eyes. To rationalize it. To be, let's say.. desensitized.

This was the poorest choice of my life. I ended up watching dozens and dozens of pictures, videos. I saw dead people. I saw dying people. Various ways. Horrendous ways. I really don't want to tell what I saw. I'm not made for this. I've never been made for this. Now I'm back to being 11. But 10x worse. I have regular flashbacks of these, each time I turn the lights off. Each time I see a violent clip in a movie or a strange music plays on. It's been months, and it stained me. It damaged me. I can't stop thinking about my mother now. What she endured. What she felt. My stomach tightens whenever it crosses my mind. I fear I might have developed PTSD.. or I maybe I dug an old one up. I feel totally lost. And it hurts so much. I feel like I brought this on myself. 


TLDR : I'm weak and stupid. Never watch these. It can destroy a man."	[]	[{'start': 205, 'end': 295, 'span': 'I ended up with a picture of an 18yo corpse, in midst of the most disgusting putrefaction.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I haven't got anywhere yet, and this is tough, just trying to ventilate something.  


I'm in my early 20s, I'm a male, I live in Europe and I have a girlfriend that tries to support me.  
I am struggling today with studies, my everyday mental state and doing what I think is required of me. But I don't seem to be able to carry all of it and sometimes it comes crashing down at me. I end up crying and downwards spiraling in my thoughts. I have trouble remembering stuff, I have trouble concentrating and it doesn't feel like I will ever get to where I want to be. I'm afraid, scared and it seems that I have gotten used to the feeling of it that I don't even notice anymore. My head is failing me and it was one of my best qualities about myself.  


I grew up with a father that used various drugs, my mother used prescription pills and a brother that turned criminal and early got a liking to drugs too. We were poor, there never was a ray of sunshine because new clouds of shit always came around.   


My earliest memories is me running from home, because my mother yelled at me to do so - because my dad was going to beat her. She told me to run to my aunt and make her call the police. I remember running, but not arriving there.  


I became the quiet kid, the kid that tried to fix everything and not cause any trouble. But when I felt down, it felt like I had nobody to turn to. (I remember embracing the pain, and hoping it would get worse. I don't know why.)  
I had my mother, but she was mostly sleeping in her bed or reading books in bed. I never told anyone outside my family either. I remember being in school, and people were complaining about things that seemed like nothing but I never could tell anyone.  


I remember feeling so horribly sad, and I went to talk with my mother. And she was high on the pills, because she said she saw angels but it was just light flashes from the cars driving by our window. And that hurt so much.  
I was crying and she didin't take care of me.   


When I got into my teen-years, I hated my father and my brother. Everytime they came around, they always brought problems home. Always turned to a scream-fest and me being stuck infront of my PC - hoping that they don't come here.  


I never got beaten by my dad, but my dad beat everyone else. ( I can't remember how severe it was, but I don't think that anyone got hospitalized. ) And my mom told me that I should feel glad/lucky that he never did, because I was his son.  


I finally got to meet a therapist, I cried and did what I thought was nessecary to get past this.  
But it won't let me go, I just want to be healthy and be a normal person. I want to stop crying everyday, I want to feel good enough and not being so fucking pitiful. I was so strong, I thought.  


Then I tried cannabis, and I realised that not all drugs are bad and.. It helps. I became addicted to it in a way, I managed my school but felt like smoking was what made my everyday life work. It felt like it affected the days afterward too.  


Then.. One night, I got a text. I was supposed to meet a guy, I did - and he and his friend scared the life out of me. I think that I could easily fucked them up(I was -very- muscular.), but I was high and.. Something snapped in my head. I froze. I took some punches, told the truth and they wanted to beat someone else now.  
 (But it backfired in two hours and they wanted to meet me and prob beat me more.)  


When I left, I was glad that I had not pissed myself or started crying. But my head was racing, I had never been so alert in my life. Adrenaline.  
I did not realise that.. That was probarly the beginning of my PTSD. I became paranoid, I moved 2 days after that.  


7 months later, I was in the military. I was not forced, but I thought it was a good idea and a nice life experience.  
2,5-3 months in, it hit me. I started flinching, I started dreaming nightmares, I became dull in my head, I once grappled with a dude and.. I became so furious, and he had to hold me because, if he had let me go earlier than he did. I maybe would have done something rash. ( I can get angry, but I -never- act on it.. I did when I was a teen, but very rarely. )  


I had to drop out, I felt that I was a failure. I came back to my country where I was born. (Neighbour country.)  
I started living with my GF and.. That is where everything turned to shit.  


I have stopped crying while writing, so that's nice. But I must have been occupied.. Less than a hour, but more than 20 minutes.   


I have forgot to mention so much. Such as, I stopped being happy after the military. My symptoms worsened.  
I did not know what was wrong with me back then, now I do.  
It felt like I was at fault, but I know now that it's just a illness or whatever you may call it.   
(English is not my primary language.)

  
I'm going to talk to a therapist again, I'm waiting for a call. (Within 10 days.)  
I try to be transparent how I feel with my GF but it's hard and sometimes I want to just fight it through without her help, because I don't want to take even more from her than she already gives me.

  
I found this sub yesterday, I was looking for a place to ventilate. I can't keep crashing and crying infront of my awesome girlfriend, I -must- get better because I don't want to lose her. (She really is the best, my gf during military cheated twice. Nice.) Anyhow, I read a post and.. The person writing felt the same way I did, I could see myself in several other posts, people who have it better or worse. And I felt glad, that I'm not crazy and you people also feel like I do.  
I know, it's f\*\*ked up but thank you for feeling like this and thank you for sharing!"

665381209e6f67f9a9a21f95	256_ptsd	I was abused, I still am My sister liked to lie to our parents to get me in trouble when we were younger, by younger I mean I was five. I'm fifteen now. It may not seem like those lies she told did much, but it was everyday and eventually it took a toll on my mental health. I'm now depressed, paranoid, I have anxiety, and PTSD. My sister got worse with how she treated me. She started physically fighting with me. If we got caught fighting she would fake cry and blame it on me. Our parents were the type to give spankings. I got those a lot, because of her. My parents always believed her because she's almost five years older than me. I remember the first time I tried to kill myself, it was after she got me in trouble one morning. I have this loose ceiling fan in my room. I was always a smart kid, but sometimes not in a good way. I was five, and I thought if I hang myself with my jump rope from my ceiling fan then if the jump rope breaks the fan will probably fall and kill me. My mom walked in the room and saw me tying a jump rope to my fan. She yelled at me and took the jump rope. I wasn't allowed near jump ropes for six years. Two months ago I had cut myself for the first time, because my sister lied again. I had flashbacks to all the other times she had hurt me in someway. I had a breakdown, and things have just been getting worse ever since. I've had the urge to cut again. Luckily I haven't, yet. I'm trapped in this house. I'm too young to leave, and my sister won't move out. I think I'm going to die here, so to everyone who reads this I want you to know what I've been wishing to have for a while now. I wish that I could have someone in the world to love. Not just someone who will show me they love me. I want to have someone that I can give all my love too. Someone I can hug, talk to, cook for, watch movies with, play videogames with, someone who I can be there for when ever they need me. I don't care about feeling loved, I want to make someone feel loved. Sadly I don't think that I'll ever get to do that. So to anyone who feels that they aren't loved, just know that if I could, I would be there for you. I'm sorry I can't be there, but just know that I care. I'll always care, even if I die. I won't stop trying to make my wish true even if it kills me in the process. I'll only be happy if I make someone else happy. That is my purpose.

665381209e6f67f9a9a21f95	631_ptsd	"PTSD court treatment update #2: The Euphoria is wearing off and reality is setting in. It’s not all bad, but it’s not all good. It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

Ive repressed a lot of memories in my life. I was raped when I was in fourth grade and repressed it until it happened again in 8th grade. Me repressing that memory kind of affected my overall memory of life. My life was very traumatic a lot of bad things have happened to me and I really haven’t taken it well. I’ve been finally getting help I was in a partial hospitalization program at the inpatient hospital I frequent for over a month. I started DBT yesterday so like I’m finally doing stuff. I think me finally starting to get help has triggered my flashbacks and what I repressed when I was a child. I feel like I’m spending more time in flashbacks then I am reality. I can’t seem to do anything without a flashback. I take a bath, flashback. Drive the car, flashback. I can’t do anything. I don’t want to talk about it with the people in my life.

But on Saturday, I was walking back from shopping in the town centre with my boyfriend, and I walked past him. He looks exactly the same as he did years ago, and I'm pretty sure he noticed me, and did that stupid hair flip that he always used to do. 

It was so weird, I just grabbed my boyfriend and walked past very quickly. I told him a couple of minutes later and he hugged me and told me it was okay etc, but I just felt so stunned.

665381209e6f67f9a9a21f95	413_ptsd	"I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**



**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7"" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2"" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.

Fast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  

Another episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.

I know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.

Sorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.

**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**

I was always kicked out of my house living at different cousins, aunts, and finally my grandmas house. One of my best friends died in my arms as I performed CPR on him waiting for the medics to arrive. I became a paramedic after that saying to myself I’m going to be better so nobody has to go through that. Turns out it’s really hard to save lives. I’m not going to go into calls I’ve ran or things I’ve seen. But friends and family always ask what’s the worst I’ve seen/done. Not realizing that to them it’s just a story but to us we relive it. It makes me just want to be alone. But at the same time I want to have friends. It’s weird. Is that a form of PTSD. I’m sorry I’m super new and don’t know how this works.

TL;DR History of sexual assault. I feeI like a fake because people have had it so much worse than me and yet my ptsd runs my life. Feel embarrassed by my lack of experience with men which is a consequence of PTSD.

I have struggled with this for a long time and I have avoided posting about it because I have been afraid of people confirming these feelings. I have been on medication prescribed to me for PTSD for a few years now and this has been my only way of allowing myself to feel valid. I don't tell people about my PTSD but when I have to I feel like I need to somehow slip the fact that I am medicated into the disclosure so that I will be taken seriously. When I say ""have to"" I am referring to situations such as the time I signed up for a self defense class and I needed them to know not to get on top of me in any way (will make sense later) and that I needed a female teacher. I needed to mention the PTSD for context. 

A little background: I have always had a fear of men and I can't really pinpoint when it started or why, but it was always more severe than the unfortunately common intimidation that many women tend to feel. I remember feeling this way as early as 7 or 8. I would avoid men in general. Experiences such as being cat called and followed in my early teens made it worse. 

The experience which really caused my PTSD happened just after i moved away from home for college. I was at a friends house one night and fell asleep on the couch. I woke up in the middle of the night with a guy 'friend' straddling me and giving me hickeys and trying to take off my clothing. I told him to get off me multiple times and he didn't. I curled up into a fetal position until he gave up and left. It felt like he was on top of me for hours but I'm guessing it was more like 15 or 20 minutes. Nothing more happened, he got off me and fell asleep somewhere in the apartment, but it left me anxious and depressed for months.  I felt dirty and guilty. I couldn't look men in the eyes and any romantic attention from men felt even more threatening than it did for me already, even if I knew that they were probably very nice guys. Because of this I have never had a boyfriend. Never slept with a man. The first and last time I had sexual contact with a man was when I woke up to someone who I thought I could trust sucking on my neck and putting his hand under my blanket. I am nearly 25 now. Its embarrassing to me and I am afraid that, at this point, if I manage to move past the anxiety of male attention that I will scare away any man with my lack of experience.

That was the first one. The second event, which blew everything up, was when I was jumped walking home at night. I am a runner and a lot stronger than I look as a small woman and managed to get away. It left me so traumatized, though, because I tried really hard to get help and no one would help me. The security guard at my apartment building told me to stop talking and tell the female security guard who was only going to be working 4 days later, and the police laughed at me when I described what happened. (Might sound unlikely but I was living in another country at this time and this isnt uncommon behavior there).

At this point I would physically start to shake if I was hanging out with a man and he got touchy. Panic attack symptoms minus hyperventilation. 
I would feel my body go cold and my muscles seize up. There was a situation when I was trying to get over this all and had been on a few dates with a guy. He kissed me and all was fine until he touched my thigh and I started having a panic attack. I was so embarrassed and humiliated because he immediately left the room to tell him roommates. Yes, I know, I found myself an asshole.

That left me with really unhealthy views of men (even more than before) and I genuinely believed for a very long time that men did not feel love and that any appearance of love was purely a form of manipulation. These experiences along with an unfortunate mother (who would tell me things like ""all men cheat"") caused me to be so scared to fall in love because to me that would mean being a slave. It took me a very long time to realise that men do feel love. People will probably be wondering this: my father is in my life and he is a good man. One of the most honest and loving people I know. No issues there.

Anyway, here I am years later. I have been through therapy, take antianxiety/antidepressants and have managed to cut down my PTSD meds to ""as needed"". So, Prazosin when I have nightmares, and that's all. I still get incredibly uncomfortable with men touching me and i am terrified of sex and it stops me from pursuing men I like. I am so worried that they will not be patient with me and that i am embarrassing. 

It's also hard to know when to bring this up with a man because I dont want to scare him off but at the same time I dont want him to scare me off by going at a pace I cant handle. 

To bring it back to my post title....I feel like a fraud. There are women who have been through experiences infinitely worse than mine and yet here I am complaining about it. It's so hard to like life. I really dont like life right now."

579e431a81f331000139d5d0	796_ptsd	"Does anybody else struggle with not remembering their trauma? I have very few conscious memories of my earliest childhood traumas, but my _body_ remembers it. I remember smells, textures, sensations, but few images, no narrative, no order of events. The myriad evidence that anything bad happened is circumstantial, but I _do_ remember enough to know I was violated, and I am definitely trigger-able. It’s almost irrelevant whether or not the trauma occurred, because regardless of what events transpired, I am left with all the trappings of PTSD.

Why, then, am I so consumed and guilt-riddled by my lack of specific memory? Why do I feel like I’m a terrible human being for suspecting the worst of my caregiver? Like even if it _did_ happen, it absolutely _must_ have been my fault for “misunderstanding” things? Like if only I knew _for sure_, why, then... Then I could argue to myself why my feelings are _differently_ illegitimate, and it’s all still my fault, with the added bonus of perpetual nightmare fuel?... I do NOT want to remember it, but at the same time, it feels invalid if I don’t.

I know there are many flavors of misery to be had with this illness, but if there’s anybody out there in a similar boat, if you have found a way to cope with crippling guilt and shame caused by absent memories, please share what has helped you. I would love to feel a little less alone.

For years I’ve abused various substances, suffered with anxiety, depression and insomnia. Having recently engaged with an addiction counsellor brought up some of my past. When I was 14 my friend was beaten so badly he died of complications relating to brain trauma a few days later. I was sat next to him. I got dragged through a murder trial. Never once did I cry about it. Turning to drugs, drink, petty theft and violence almost immediately after. My mother I suspect is a covert narcissist and my father an emotional black hole. The whole thing got brushed aside while I started to burn my life. 

My whole life I thought I had absolutely no feelings around this. I genuinely felt nothing. Zero. Until I stumbled across it in counselling. Only now am I coming to realise I do have very strong feelings around this. For 20 odd years I’ve been suppressing this with various substances, never realising the reason for my pain. Only now realising why I feel scared when the phone rings (one of my friends rang me to tell me my friend had died).  

My doctor diagnosed me with ptsd today. I thought I’d feel relieved but I just feel incredibly sad that I’ve been carrying this around with me for so long, buried so deep, manifesting in depression, insomnia and substance abuse amongst other things.

579e431a81f331000139d5d0	1152_ptsd	"Just Found Out So yesterday was I guess what you would call a breakthrough for me in thearpy.

For the past month or so I have had a few family and friends say they think I have ptsd which I ignored heavily cause of that ""what do they know right?"" However my sister-in-law was one of them and her dad and older brother were combat vets and suffered ptsd badly so when she said it it took me off balance and I guess triggered me.

Well then Wednesday I had to follow up with my PCD on bipolar meds and we discussed how I feel like I've had set backs dealing with my depression that still persisted through the medication and even he said it sounded alot like I had ptsd.

Well I went to my normal therapist session yesterday and it felt different from the start. He was delving deeper into things I was saying more so then the content itself and finally mentioned ptsd twice which took me off guard again and got me flustered.

He caught me lying twice and I guess cornered me for lack of a better words and in a revelation or release I'm not sure which finally drove the nail home that I suffer from PTSD.

A huge chunk of the issues lays with my dad and how he was physically and mentally abusive to me, my brothers, and my mother who left when I was 2. I caught alot of the mental.

It hurt alot to finally admit it to myself and, that I felt very exposed.

Even now I still feel hypervigilant but I know where it comes from now.

My biggest worry is now that I know I'm afraid it will hurt to much and well make things worse and lead somewhere I dont wanna go to.

Sorry for the length I just felt I had to kinda tell someone or some people to I guess vent about it.

The last question is how do you guys cope with it? How do you handle or deal with your triggers now that you are aware of it? I've stayed non violent about it this whole time(alot of temper flares and screaming and yelling but no physical violence) but, I'm afraid some triggers may make.me that way now that I feel kinda vulnerable.

Anyway thanks for reading my story/venting/acceptance."

579e431a81f331000139d5d0	420_ptsd	"Possible trauma from hospitalization, and people think I need to get over it. I was 21 at the time, now I'm 22. In May of 2017, I got really sick out of no where. In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. 

At 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. 

The doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said ""what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?"" I said I didn't know what was wrong. 

After they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. 

They discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a ""nasty fever"" and told me to rest for a few days.

At 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. 

Positive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.

Being septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. 

I returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). 

Now I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. 

I constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit.

I grew up in an abusive household with my mother and step father. Mother would beat me and my step father would molest me since I was as young as 7 or 8 yrs old... or well what I can remember up until I was about 12. When I turned 13  I moved in with my sexist father.

Fast forward 2 years, I met my now ex of 4 years. I lost my virginity to him, however, he turned out to be very abusive 8 months into the relationship.  He raped me, beat me, and verbally abused me. Took 4 years to really get out of that toxic relationship.

Shortly after the break up  I was raped by someone I thought I was becoming friends with. BUT then again... what did I know about making friends. I was an outcast and had no friends growing up and my ex wouldn't let me have friends. Anyways this person stalked me and threatened me after. I quit my job and moved shortly after not too far but where he didn't know I lived.


In between and after all this... quite a few men has looked at me or/and treated me like some sort of toy for their pleasure. 

I'm so emotionally broken. I don't know what to do with myself sometimes. Since then I've met an amazing person who treats me right ... but I don't know if I really want to be with this person. I've made friends that don't hurt me and seem to care. 

But I have no one I can really talk to about all this. I mean they know the gist. But I'm that ""happy friend""-- you know the one that is never sad or cries, the one who listens and is always smiling. Keeping those happy, positive vibes.

Deep down though ... I'm sad. I struggle with a lot of anxiety and depression. I have PTSD and try so hard to push through each and every day. Some days It feels easier than others. Most days I can't focus on anything and am completely overwhelmed with my memories, thoughts, emotions. 

I don't feel like anyone around me truely understands what a toll all this has taken on me and how much it actually hurts me. To them it seems like because it is in the past I should be just fine and dandy now (like out of sight - out of mind type thing) or they simply have nothing helpful to say. 

I can't really blame them for not understanding. But I'm just going through it right now. My anxiety has been through the roof and I stupidly start to shake uncontrollably and breathing sounds like I'm shivering.

I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive.

**TW// Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD.

***I skipped A LOT of other issues/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***

Here are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this.

I don’t want to elaborate too much, but my friend had gotten really drunk and had what we believed to be a psychotic episode and physically attacked me. Since this incident, he has been attending therapy and I have as well. But although I’ve discussed it a couple times with my therapist...I’m not sure I’m really past what happened. I thought that maybe I was over it after talking about it several times, but I don’t really know how to treat this. I haven’t been diagnosed with PTSD and I don’t have reoccurring flashbacks besides a few small instances. But currently, due to other issues in our friendship, I feel less and less inclined to be around him or reach out to him. I don’t want to end our friendship but at the same time, I don’t mentally have the energy to deal with him. I just feel kinda blah about my relationship with him and I don’t know if I’m really “over” what happened, or just continuing to push it behind me.

I was raped throughout my childhood by my father. He is no longer in my life as an adult. However I still suffer from ptsd due to the trauma. One thing that starts happening to me when I go through an episode (episodes may last days) is that I start becoming disgusted with men. This includes my boyfriend. The fact that he ever wants to have sex with me or that he looks at porn or has any sexual thought whatsoever absolutely disturbs me. I want nothing to do with men at these times and don’t even want to be touched by my boyfriend. Thing is, he is a really nice, supportive man that I’m very lucky to have. He doesn’t ever deserve to be seen that way. I think he deserves someone who is more normal.

5ee944d1886b7d1b8481387d	248_ptsd	"Everything triggers flashbacks, crying every day I’m 23 years old, and last year in April my 15 year old brother hung himself in his closet. 
We were best friends, partners in crime. We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. 
I was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn’t feel like I was getting better. 
I was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn’t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. 
I saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I’m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. 
I’ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. 
My medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. 
It’s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can’t handle my grief, I can’t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It’s absolutely horrible. 
I’m a hairdresser and I’ll have clients say certain words to me like “hang” “closet” “died/death” “brother” or make jokes about suicide even though it’s completely out of context I’ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It’s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don’t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. 
I hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can’t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. 
It is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I’m not ready to explain to the people around me what I’m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. 
It’s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don’t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. 

I can’t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I’m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn’t like me. Advance on getting over that fear would be so appreciated because I KNOW I need some serious therapy right now and my family tells me all the time. Does anyone have any good skills in these areas? Please help me. I’m suffering and I know damn well I can’t go through the rest of my life like this. 

TLDR — My baby brother committed suicide last year, and I ended up developing PTSD from it; I have been having extreme flashbacks and my therapist stopped treating me due to my diagnosis. I really need advice on coping skills for flashbacks &amp; how to be vulnerable to another professional."

612f6a51d47b137e5f17b49c	1112_ptsd	"PTSD and digitizing childhood vhs tapes Hi, I need to talk about this because I don't have anyone I'm comfortable sharing with.

I am going to bring up a couple things that I'm struggling with and share some background so this makes sense. I am F/29 and I am a *survivor* (never said or typed that before) of abuse by the hands, words and actions of a few people. Some of these people I am just now realizing did things to me and happen to still be in my life. This is why I'm posting. I don't know how to manage the way I'm feeling about these flashbacks.

I realized it wasn't just my father who abused me as a child. My childhood vhs tapes. My father narrates and is the man behind the camera in 98% of these tapes. I have probably 20+ vhs tapes I am digitizing for my sister and mother. I knew it could trigger some panic attacks or flash backs to hear or see my father on these videos, but I decided I was strong and I could handle it so my family could share in these memories and I can edit him out as a gift. None of us speak with my father anymore due to his abuse of drugs and us. This is hard to type because I hate seeing this in my head again and it feels horrible. I apologize for how oddly this is written, I'm in a state of shock I think because of what I'm learning.

**Background**

Growing up I have a couple blurry memories or flashbacks of my father doing things that are wrong. One flashback is of me and my mother nude hiding in their closet, wrapped up in their comforter while he is yelling. Another memory is him following me up the stairs and pulling my pants down. Another is him putting his tongue in my mouth. All of these I believe I was maybe 5-7 or even 8? I don't really know. I didn't say anything until I remembered the first thing when I was 15. My parents were divorced when I was 13 or 14 due to his drinking and drugging and abusive ways. I have one sister who is 18 months younger than myself. I also have a very saddening memory of my father being angry with her for not staying upright on her bike (she was probably 4 or 5? so I was 6 or 7). He had cornered us in the laundry room and he was hitting her with a broomstick as she tried to climb into a cabinet where her shoes were kept. I was on my back kicking at him. Her little knees were bleeding so badly from falling on her bike. I don't know why I remember this incident so vividly. CPS has been called on my father 3 times. I don't know much but he was taken to court after me telling a therapist about the first flashback at 15. My mother tells me that she ""made it to where I didn't have to testify"". I don't know a lot about the court case. I know my father is re-married to a woman who is younger than him by at least 10 yrs. She had a 3 and 5 y/o when they married. Those kids are now much older and finishing high school and starting college. I know their father was worried about what my father had done to me and wanted to keep his children safe. I wish I was able to learn the details of these things. I only have my mother as my source and she can be misleading at times and also doesn't remember everything either.

I had stopped all contact with my father at 15 and ended up in treatment by the age of 17 because I was an emotional wreck. I think I still am. Anyway, once I turned 19 a boyfriend (who was also abusive and much older than myself by 10 yrs) convinced me that I needed my father in my life. I regret being convinced every day. I cut ties with him and his blood relatives when I was 26. He had told me he solved an argument with my step brother (who was 13 or 14 at the time) by ""quickly and physically ending the disagreement"". After hearing that I got out of his car, said ""goodbye"" and never spoke to him again. I was frozen. I felt that it was my fault. My step brother ended up in treatment similar to mine for some time. I don't know how he is doing now since I don't speak with my father's side, but I hope he's alright. I also hope my little step sister is alright. I don't know if I can forgive myself for ""leaving"" them.

**The Videos**

I started digitizing and felt fine with hearing his voice at first. It kind of sounds like an old video tape instead of what he sounded like 3 years ago in person or even on the phone. I thought ""Ok, I can do this just fine, just start with the tapes that Mom and sister will like to see first."" This was turning out to be great because I could see my grand parents and great grand parents, my aunt and mother and myself and my sister. I couldn't stop watching. My mind was racing. I chose a tape that was labeled ""1996"" - I realized there were a few copies of the same footage with the same label. I watched this tape and it's pretty normal until it stops and comes on and I hear my father saying things about how it's early in the morning. How he's going to show me this in the morning. I am heard saying ""no"" and clearly uncomfortable. Watching this I was horrified. I can see is the dimly lit room that was clearly the master bedroom floor. I am laying on the floor under a blanket. I am watching this for the first time my husband and I were looking at each other in shock. I immediately stopped it and was sobbing. Why would my dad take that video? What is the reason for that? Is that video part of what my first flashback was or was this a regular occurrence that I still can't remember?

I was alarmed to see footage of my father dropping me down a slide when I was barely able to walk. My mother reacted clearly upset and the camera went off as you hear me screaming. There was another tape from ""1996"" where I'm crying hysterically and it keeps cutting in and out of weird conversation with me sobbing. My little sister is trying to comfort me. My mother is not there. I can almost remember parts of this that aren't on camera. My dad says something to me, as he is shooting the video, about how no one thinks I'm a brat, and he asks ""right?"" to my sister and she says something like ""only mom and dad think \_\_\_\_\_\_ is a brat."" He quickly corrects her and she seems to look like she's confused by his manipulation. The camera goes off and then comes back on to my face. My hair is soaked with tears and is stuck to my face from crying so much. I believe my dad starts telling me to go to bed and I refuse and cry more. Watching this I can tell that I'm afraid to go to bed because I know what he's going to do. I won't get into that because I don't truly remember much. I know it's blocked out and I'm afraid to watch more because It could all come back.

I gave myself a couple days after that footage. I was afraid I'd see something worse. I decided to watch my sisters birthday party in 1996. It was on another tape labeled ""1996"". My sister is turning 5 and we are at the local pool with some childhood friends and some family. I see my cousin and I see my childhood friend. I instantly remember inappropriate things happening with those boys. My cousin used to pretend we were ""married"" when we were around that age. He would make me go into a bathroom after our ""marriage"" and undress with him. He always locked the door. He is about 2 years older than I am. I remember feeling like it was wrong but that he was older so it must be ok. I don't remember much of what happened in the bathrooms when this stuff used to happen. I know for sure it happened in 2 places. I know I was crying at one of them and my sister was knocking on the door. It was a family vacation. He has a daughter now and she is about 5. I hate him.

My childhood friend I mentioned, he also made me take my clothes off because of what ""grown ups do when they get married"". This must have been at the same age as my cousin incident. I remember something weird he did once he made me lay on top of him, he said we had to touch nipples....then I remember his mother walked in on us. I felt instant embarrassment and guilt, but being so young, I didn't know exactly what was wrong. She never said anything or did anything. This friend is still in my life and also has a brand new daughter. They were at my wedding and so was that cousin. I feel sick thinking about this. How could his mother not have done anything!!?? I saw her face in that video too and felt even more sick. Once we were in the high school ages, we spent more time together. He talked me into cheating on my boyfriends because ""kissing isn't cheating"". He'd feel me up and I told myself it was ok because we weren't having sex. I hate myself for this.

I hate seeing these people on my video tapes and remembering these things. It makes me feel like my family isn't real. It makes me question if things really happened even though I know certain things definitely did. I continue to doubt myself and pretend I'm ok. I'm not ok. I'm having a very hard time with these new things and I feel physically sick reliving these things.

**Can having abusers in life be a pattern for some survivors?**

I have had far too many moments in my life where my innocence was taken from me or I was hurt in different ways. I was raped by an ex for years. He took photos of me after he drugged me when he took me out of the country. He was so much like my father. So many red flags and I should have ran screaming, but he was SO manipulative. He told me no one would ever love me like he loved me. He exposed me to HEP-C for years and never told me. He cheated on me. He would tell me I was overweight and that my style was boring. He told me I didn't ""do anything"". He would force me to have sex with him every day multiple times a day. I was fresh from treatment, he was sober and had been for years. I thought he was safe. He even convinced my mother he was great along with other family. He has thousands of nude photos of me from the age of 18-22. He refused to destroy them when I begged for many years. He'd always convince me to come back when I'd leave him or when he said something painfully horrible. He'd show up at my apartments while I was in college in the middle of the night yelling at me. He was a 3x felon. He was an addict and when I left for good, he started drinking again and then using drugs. No idea where he is now, but I pray it's prison. He had his 3 strikes.

I also have been in a friendship where a guy in college became obsessed with me and stalked me. I had to go to the Dean of Students because he had signed up to be in every one of my classes. This was after he had left things at my doorstep, stood outside my front door at 3am whispering my name and sending me paragraphs about how he wanted to ""practice having sex"" with me ""because we are best friends"" and he ""felt like I would give him feedback"" *WHAT THE FUCK!?* \- Guess what - the college only asked him to change classes. That's it. The Dean told me they would kick him out of the college, expel him from classes that semester or ask him to change his classes. I had to tell all my professors on my own because the college didn't have my back. He even showed up in NY when I moved after college, and I moved across the country.....I finally got rid of him when I moved from NY.

There was a guy in college who raped me because I was too drunk to drive home one night. He offered his bed and he slept on the couch until he joined me in bed later that night. I woke up and he was having sex with me. I remember he noticed I woke up and put a condom on. I was frozen. I didn't know what to do. I left when I could see the sun was coming up. I wouldn't talk to him and he acted like he didn't know what was wrong. He'd even send me texts if he was on the same bus to tell me he was behind me. I'm still confused by that.

I'm sorry I spilled this mess here. I have a lot in my head and I don't know how to get it out. I have no one to talk to. No one understands unless they've had these things happen. I'm tired of sharing with someone I feel I can share with and they tell me they don't believe me, or ghost me completely. I had began to keep it all to myself for a few years in college and now I'm busting at the seams with flashbacks and panic attacks. I had a flashback when I was skiing with my husband this year. My father did things to me once when he was teaching me to ski as a kid. I was in the trees and it all came back. I don't know how to talk to my husband about these things. He doesn't understand. He means well and he's good to me, but he will never understand what I feel and what happened to me. I've never been able to really heal from any of this and I'm just now remembering things. I feel like a pile of used, damaged crap. I'm in a new city now, and I don't have any close friends here. I feel lonely and these flashbacks have affected my social abilities. I'm always on edge and I just thought I could share on here and someone might be able to tell me I'm not crazy and that I'm not bad for what happened. I feel I am though."

612f6a51d47b137e5f17b49c	1302_ptsd	"I'm not sure if I have ptsd or not.. I wish I could have thought of a better title for this but honest to god I can't. It's not something that's particularly weighing heavy on me, I just wanted some input. I'm a 23 year old male from Columbus, Ohio also.

Last fall/summer I was the victim of domestic abuse. My girlfriend at the time beat the shit out of me without any warning, it was my first and hopefully last time ever experiencing something of the sort and the fact that someone I loved so deeply could have did that was what really made it worse more than anything... It was only one time that this happened.

There's been a few times where I'll be laying in bed before I go to sleep and I'll see flashbacks of it and go into a panic attack. The way she breathed heavily before it happened, nearly hyperventilating. The way she marched up to me in silence and hit me square in the face... me repeatedly screaming at her to stop whilst trying to restrain her. It all would just come out right before bed but never during my day and these panic attacks maybe happened 2-3 times. This was in the first month after it happened and it hasn't really happened since... as time went on I accepted what happened. Or atleast thought I did...

Fast forward nearly 4 months. Just yesterday when I was at work, I was minding my own business doing my job when I heard a woman frantically yelling at somebody somewhere across the warehouse. It very much reminded me of the way my ex yelled at me the way she did that night when she assaulted me.. The type of loud yelling from a woman where their voice starts to grow hoarse from it while they're yelling. Idk it's hard to describe... but suddenly, I stopped what I was doing and began to shake and hyperventilate as those same flashbacks of that night I described started happening. I put my scanner down and went to the bathroom and had a panic attack on the floor.

The reason I'm not sure if it is PTSD is because it was just one instance where domestic violence occurred in my life, to me it could just be me still not being able to accept what happened. Normally you hear about the common case of combat veterans, rape victims or people who endured prolonged abuse in a relationship that develop PTSD but I feel like one instance of abuse like that shouldn't cause someone to develop it... or maybe it can. That's why I'm on the internet asking strangers about it. 

Thoughts? And thanks for reading. "	[]	[{'start': 275, 'end': 310, 'span': 'I was the victim of domestic abuse.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

I have PTSD and anxiety and have been working with my Therapist to not only set boundaries but also put myself first (I tend to put others before my needs and burn out). Boy is it hard. 

I  had a rough month last month. Got hired on into a new job, Dad was diagnosed with cancer and had surgery. Fiancé went through issues that triggered his anxiety and on top of all of that I’m working on healing from my trauma and all the spin offs from it (I’m a assault survivor and the anniversary just happened).  I’m going through some of the darker parts of what happened in therapy and it’s draining on me. 

Also add that my mom leans on me for support and I had to talk her down from anxiety in relation to my dad while trying to deal with my own pain and emotions from it.

Rough month right? 

I finally hit a wall, I just needed a break.  I had to be strong with all that was going on and it hit me hard.  And yesterday I felt that straw break.  

In the middle of all the craziness that was happening at work yesterday, my mom calls me...my step grandmother has cancer (bone) and I just couldn’t. I didn’t want to hear it at that time.  I had shut down. 

I couldn’t provide the logic my mom wanted to hear. She didn’t even listen to me when I asked her to stop. She just kept going on and on about what cancer it was and what may happen next and how everyone is upset.  I actually snapped and yelled stop. I told her I could not process right now and that I need a break. I asked to let me had the night and we can talk about it the next day.  

Her response was to tell me that “I could just find out about it myself” and hung up on me. 

I’m angry, hurt and shutting down, please tell me others have felt this way too. "	[]	[{'start': 513, 'end': 571, 'span': '(I’m a assault survivor and the anniversary just happened)', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]

February 2019 was the best and worst month of my life. I welcomed my biggest blessing my son on feb 4th, then 9 days later that joy turned to the most traumatic thing I’ve ever experienced. 

A quick back story: I had my child when i was 21. The birth of my son was very painless and the whole experience was very positive. No painful contractions, no complications with the csection or anything.

Back to the story. after a csection they give you narcotic pain meds. On feb 13th i started weening myself off the pills because i wasn’t in that much pain anymore. That whole day i felt like something was off in my body. I had chills but my body was hot and i felt nauseous. I figured it was the effects from no longer taking the pain meds. After hours of not feeling well my dad took my temperature and it was 104.3. My dad kept my baby while my boyfriend took me to the hospital. 

Upon arriving and telling them my symptoms i was immediately swarmed my so many doctors and nurses like the scene of a movie. They asked millions of questions and stuck IV’s and sensors all over me. 

Fast forward i learn i have sepsis and a blood clot in my ovarian vein. You’d think those are pretty simple fixes. Wrong. 

I spent 2 weeks in the hospital and i barely have any memory of most of it but i remember flashes. 

During that time i had several blood transfusions, blood drawn every 3 hours everyday for 2 weeks and they stuck me in a different vein every time, got given heparin (blood thinner) for the blood clot which they later realized i was allergic to do they switched me to another blood thinner, got given so many different antibiotics for the sepsis, had 3 different IV’s at the same time and a PICC line, had a foley Catheter and a feeding tube, was in the icu in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator, had to do physical therapy to walk, had to get my lungs drained after catching pneumonia from the ventilator, had to get fluid sucked out of my abdomen via ct machine needle insertion, and so many tests and labs i can’t keep up. 

Was sent home with 11 prescription as well as a blood thinner injection i had to give myself everyday. All while having a newborn at home waiting for me.

Most traumatic experience of my life. It still causes me bad anxiety til this day and it’s even worst a lot more happened that i can’t remember. I was there for 3 weeks but to me it felt like 3 days.

Still a year later i haven’t met anyone who can understand or relate to me regarding the experience"	[]	[{'start': 0, 'end': 141, 'span': 'Traumatic hospital stay caused PTSD TLDR: traumatic hospital icu stay caused PTSD \r\n\r\nFebruary 2019 was the best and worst month of my life.

612f6a51d47b137e5f17b49c	454_ptsd	"Is it possible to have PTSD and not really remember the precise cause / causes? Years ago I was diagnosed by a therapist as having PTSD. Actually, this was almost ten years ago I received this diagnosis. 

At the time, I was in disbelief and thought the guy was a quack. I've never been in combat, never been in a major accident and never had anything extremely traumatic happen to me. Now like may children of my generation (1980s) I was beaten quite a bit by my dad which I know is messed up, and then I was intensely bullied in childhood for several years. But that's the worst of it. I don't think my childhood was exceptional, just frustrating. 

But after speaking with people close to me, and going through the checklist of symptoms, it was undeniable. So I accepted the diagnosis. Eventually I got a prescription for Wellbutrin and it helped me manage many of my symptoms somewhat for the past decade. 

Lately I've been going through some stressful external events and a month ago due to lack of sleep + stress I had a bit of a freakout with somebody I've been seeing. While my behavior was forgiven, trust was rattled, and it made me rethink about my old diagnosis. Lately I've taken extremely low doses of Xanax (.25 mg) during stressful moments  take the edge off and it's been helpful. And being able to have stress-free moments is helping me think clearly.

And sadly, the only conclusion I can make is that PTSD has robbed my life of friendships and opportunities, and will very likely put me in the grave one day if I don't manage it better. 

But it's frustrating because its (1) incurable and (2) I can't even determine what the f--- gave me PTSD.

I want to conquer this, but the last thing I want is to start adding benzos to wellbutrin to do it. It's just temporary. 

I've heard of meditation -- it does not work. Not for me anyway.

Frustrating. Is there anybody else who has this illness but doesn't even know why?

New member here. 
Basically went through some very rough stuff throughout childhood and witnessed very scary domestic abuse between my parents. Lots of yelling (my dad can be very scary) hitting in front of me, etc.
To this day my parents are still married and the physical fighting has subsided, yet they will still get into a yelling/ door slamming match every now and then that just sends me into tears despite being 20 years old. I still hate all forms of yelling/voice raising. Even when my mom is just calling a sibling from the other room, I shudder at the sound of just her yelling. 

The other night, I was smoking with my sister and her friends. I used to be a frequent smoker, nearly everyday mostly and every single day occasionally for a few months here and there, mostly to deal with depression and such. However we were taking dabs, which I have taken before without this effect, but clearly I got much more high a lot quicker than from a bowl or blunt. Anyway, I proceeded to go lay on the couch in my basement and I SWORE I could hear my dad clear as day screaming at my mom. I knew I was super high and scared, but over and over I would hear his voice in my head. I went upstairs and checked, they were completely fast asleep.

Was this some form of ptsd that was triggered by being high? Is this possible? I just felt so scared and my heart was beating extremely hard at the sheer thought of my dad yelling.

Anyways, I've witnessed a lot of death, comes with the job. It is what it is. Well there are a few scenes I cannot stop dreaming about. Except the people who were killed, murdered or tortured are replaced by my wife, friends and family.

Over and over and over again I watch everyone close to me die. It's extremely vivid as if I'm witnessing it one the first day I saw it.

I've watched my wife beheaded and her face skinned and the men and woman dance around with her face on their own as if they were wearing a mask. Just like what I saw. 

I've watched my friends dunked into pools of water trapped in cages and drown. Members of my family stoned, or executed in various ways.

The worst part is it all feels real and it's a mind-fuck waking up and sorting it all out.

I've woken up in tears within the past year and half more times than not.

 We had a psychologist embedded in my unit but he couldn't alter medical records but he informed me of my PTSD. My appt is 30 Jul to have PTSD finally put in my medical records.

My first negative experience with figures of authority involved border agents sending us to secondary revision because my father didn't understand English very well and responded incorrectly to one of the questions. They asked if we brought anything from Mexico and he said no but because we had grocery bags in the back that was enough to cause suspicion. We were let go eventually but I still remember the dread of the event. Recently, I've had to deal with police officers coming to my residence looking for someone claiming to have an arrest warrant. The three times they were here I felt insulted, violated, subhuman. The police have insulted my disability. They've forced their way into my home while claiming to be willing to talk outside. They've threatened to break down doors. I've reached out to friends in activist circles and they've helped me deal with some of the trauma and given me information about organizations to reach out to. I've only been able to sleep sporadically. I'm afraid to open doors or go outside. I haven't been taking my meds. Everytime I feel like I'm making progress, something gets in the way of my recovery. It's not fair. I wish I had super powers so I could protect myself, my family, my community.

Your difficulty in feeling sexually engaged and your description of the shame and self-loathing you feel are normal responses to the rapes you experienced. A good therapist can help you to process your traumas and understand that you did nothing wrong to cause the rapes; the shame is not yours. It takes a very patient and loving partner, but you can make progress towards a healthier sexual relationship with your wife.

Things have been going well for the most part, with the exception of a small misunderstanding that resulted in him going silent for about 2 weeks. We spoke and moved past that but last night marked our newest miscommunication.

Early in the relationship, A expressed to me that sometimes he has a hard time with seeing blood. That it makes him uncomfortable but he’s good for the most part. We planned to spend this weekend together, sort of a little stay-cation. Yesterday, we arrived at our accommodations, ate a nice meal and I changed into something sexy for him. Things were going great. We had been very excited, this would have been our first time
waking up together. Eventually, we were intimate with each other (not the first time). During sex, I started to bleed a bit. A mild-moderate amount, but enough for him to notice. He immediately went to the bathroom and spent about 5 minutes cleaning himself off. He was very uncomfortable with it. Once we sat back down, he didn’t even touch me. He’s very well endowed, over 8 easily so I suspect that has something to do with it. We discussed this, and that that is most likely what caused the bleeding. He was unable to move on from it. He explained to me that he was having severe anxiety over it, and that he wasn’t trying to be a jerk but that the smell/sight of blood is hard for him as he’s seen so much of it in his life. He shared briefly that he’s smelled blood burning, and seen wounds. I was open and listening at assured him that I want to be there for him and whatever he needs I want to try to do. Eventually, he said he needed to leave to go get his medicine(I’m assuming for anxiety). He kissed me, hugged me and damn near ran out of the hotel room.

I’m struggling with a few feelings at the moment. I feel resentful that he left me, on a weekend we planned together, alone in a hotel room at 10pm and didn’t care enough to text me and check on me last night or make sure I was safe this morning. I feel self conscious that after sex, he sat away from me on the bed as if he was repulsed by me. I’m also empathetic to him, and I want to be there for him and his support system but I’m being shut out. I don’t know what to do. I called once when I woke up, then sent a cute little “sending you smiles” gif.... nothing in return from a man who texts me Goodmorning every day. 

At this point, I suppose the only option is to step back and let him reach out to me when he’s ready, but I’m a communicator and this is 100% opposite of my nature.

A little bit of background story. Started grown up job which consited of driving a lot. Had 2 car accidents in a short period of time. After the second one I couldnt take anything anymore and felt like I was having a mental meltdown. Worked since i was 14 and couldnt lift a finger after the accident. Felt like I was losing my mind literally. 

Couldnt talk to people normally without crying and wasnt myself anymore. Childhood things arose during therapy sessions like arguing of my parents and molestations from family member. I thought that I outgrew everything but after the accidents I cant live my normal life without thinking about the past, crying and feeling worthless. My love for people and life dissapeard as if was never there and was feeling quite suicidal without wanting to be actually dead for a long while.

Was going to therapy since the beginning. Therapist was thinking about PTSD but after telling her that my normal doctor suspected me from having post concussion syndrome (because of the forgetfulness, headaches dizziness etc) she is waiting for other test i guess to conclude that it really is ptsd.

Im really hopeless and want to do just anything to get better. So my question is can anyone relate to this or what do you advise me to tell my therapist because I really wanted to start EMDR and I feel as if it is going to take forever..

His mom, my grandma, only lived a mile down the road from my mom’s house, and I was so awe-stricken with my dad that I got to stay with him for a long time.  Meanwhile, I did not realize that my mom was doing hardcore drugs.  My mom went to prison for that and lost her café.  We live in a very small town, so everyone knew about it, and I was bullied because of who my parents were.  My dad ended up getting in with the wrong people and went back to prison. 
   My mom and him had a mutual friend and often hung out at that person’s house.  My parents did not get along at this point.  We were driving him home one day from this house, and my mom stopped the car and kicked him out.  He got out of the car, went to the driver’s side, and punched my mom in the face.  I got out and told him not to hit my mom.  At that point, I was really scared and mad that he did that, so I ran towards him to stop him.  He literally picked me up and threw me on the back of a gravel road.  I couldn't even walk.  My mom tried to help me, but he started choking her.  I hobbled over, and she barely got into the car, and we quickly drove away and called the police and ambulance.  He was so badly strung out on drugs.  He went to prison again and seems to be doing well.  I met up with him once with my grandma, and we had coffee, but he's so hard to handle.  I think a lot of it is that I can't bring myself to forgive him.  My mom went back to prison again for drugs, and while she was in there, I moved in with my dad’s mom (the one who lived just down the road) because I trust her, her house is stable, and she's more nurturing, understanding, and loving then my other grandparents.  I also stay at my boyfriend’s a lot.  Now that my mom is out of prison, she's trying to control every aspect of my life."

5c966ef941172c00165d6fc5	1100_ptsd	"Medical PTSD - My Story I have begun to realize over the past couple of years that I have medical PTSD resulting from the treatment of a heart condition that I was born with. I have had various hospital appointments over the course of my life (now in my mid-twenties) as well as tests and a second surgery several years ago. I will require more of all of these in the future. Since I was a child I have had severe reactions when going to the hospital or even thinking about my condition and I would break down in tears as a child during appointments. I hate being touched and having to undress during appointments, I feel like I am being violated. My brain and body react to the doctors and nurses as if they were going to hurt me, I am physically and mentally terrified of even going near them and I am completely unable to consciously override this reaction. I cannot stand sounds, sights and smells that remind me of anything to do with my condition, and I will actively go out of my way to avoid them.    

 I have flashbacks where I involuntarily replay experiences in the hospital and similar nightmares several times per week. I've also had issues with malpractice, administrative errors and one doctor being almost emotionally abusive, deliberately exaggerating the severity of her condition so they could exercise power and authority over me as a terrified child. I've been diagnosed with a number of mental health conditions after short consultations with a GP - depression, anxiety, insomnia, health anxiety, social anxiety, but since becoming aware of the symptoms of ptsd and briefly seeing a therapist last year, it has become clear to me that undiagnosed ptsd is likely at the root of my problems.    

I feel like I am constantly in fight or flight mode, I can't calm down, slow down my breathing or untense my muscles because I have so much adrenaline flowing through my body all the time. I also think I'm seeing physical symptoms from being in this state for so much of my life - tiredness, poor concentration, autoimmune disorders, etc. I',m currently contacting therapists with experience working with ptsd to see if I can finally start to get a handle on this. For a long time I've struggled with feeling like my symptoms weren't legitimate, being told by doctors and my parents that I was just making it up for attention, I was a clever girl and I needed to stop messing around, that nothing was really wrong etc, all while my trust in people continues to get worse and I use substances to try and temper down my mental and physical reactions. I think by posting my story here I just want some sort of validation that my ptsd is real and valid, that I deserve help and treatment. I would really appreciate a conversation with anybody with medical ptsd, or anyone that can relate in general, feel free to DM me! Thank you for reading this small essay, it really means a lot to me."

So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again.  She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week.

5c966ef941172c00165d6fc5	1002_ptsd	"Just PTSD ramblings about a shitty PTSD day TL;DR Met someone else with PTSD. Tried to help - feel like I really screwed up, feel like maybe I didn't.

Sorry if I ramble, I'm a bit shaken up. I was recently introduced to someone who also has PTSD. I was a bit reluctant to connect but decided to be cautiously optimistic as there aren't many ways to meet people here (besides bars) or any local PTSD peer/group resources in our area for civilians. Done all the one on one with counselors and need to connect in person with others who can relate. Knowing to be careful in any case, and not looking for dating (and making that clear to him), we met a only a few times and chatted about how to address PTSD symptoms in a healthy manner. Friendly and polite, encouraging his engagement with hobbies while having some laughs as we seemed to share the same type of humour. Just decent human stuff.

Fast forward to today. Another invitation but me declining as I'm sicker than a dog with fever and chills. Christ if I didn't suddenly get multiple messages about how he'd received bad news and was in the middle of a PTSD episode. On to how I grounded him and helped him think clearer and had hopes I'd find him attractive, etc. Then sharing how missed his army buddies who'd died and wanted to give up as life is too painful. Over and over again. I tried calling but he wouldn't pick up. Just more messages of the same nature. And more.

It's an unsettling position and my heart was going out to him. I used to have the same dark thoughts time to time. There was also more than one occasion as a kid where someone gouged their wrists open in front of me or I had to hold them down because they were trying to throw themselves in harms way.

Not knowing his family or anyone he might know, I looked up and called a vet line asking if they could help out. They instructed me contact the local RCMP. I did so, explaining the above and asking if they could just make sure he was okay.

They advised me to keep him engaged in conversation if I could while they sent someone over. Cut short our call when his doorbell rang. A few moments later, the RCMP called me back asking about his phone as it was going straight to voicemail and he had all his lights out and curtains drawn. All I could do was repeat the number. About 15 minutes later, a call back. He'd stated he was fine and downplayed his claims, citing counselors, medications, etc that he says he's accessing so they left.

In come a bunch of nasty messages. To the effect of ""if I really cared, I would have come over myself. He went on to state he'd been thrown around by members when having a bad day but he was just sad. That he has negative feelings toward them. That he'd made the mistake in trusting me and I overstepped boundaries. That civi's can't be trusted. How his last girlfriend had done the same thing to him by calling when he was just having a bad day. It was her fault the they'd roughed him up"". On and on. 

I could only tell him that I didn't have much choice. That I'm not their hugest fan the past couple years myself but he's expressing suicidal ideology, and I don't know who he has in his life he trusts. That no one was out to get him here and that I don't deserve to be punished for trying to do the decent human thing. And that I am not his girlfriend (only physical contact had been a quick hug as I left a few days ago). That if he reads his miles of texts it shows his PTSD in getting in the way of of non-professionals helping him right now and provided the local crisis line number. I wished him well and reminded him that I needed to be healthy and care of myself by blocking him. Done. Nothing nasty or confrontational. 

Thing is, some stupid part of me still wants to apologize and calm him down. I'd meant no harm at all but screwed up. I'm jumping at every little sound and feel as though I'm somehow ""in trouble"" for some misdeed. I don't think my cell block even works properly but I'm afraid to look and find out. Having been brought up being held responsible for others' unpredictable actions and fists slammed on me for not measuring up to babysitting them, it can grind a person down. After how long I'm finally starting to see that in me now? Jesus.

I was also just starting to get to the point in life of emotionally realizing that I'm not as obligated as I feel or as others have guilted me to feel. There's a tiny part in me that knows I don't deserve this dynamic, and even wants to say ""I don't owe you or anyone else anything. Get off my back"". It doesn't feel strong at the moment, but it's probably just tiredness, flu, and needing to go back to bed. What a bunch of high school crap.

But I do miss my home city. You can at least try to escape into the crowds if you need to get away. Maybe even utter a quick ""Fuck off, freak"" before running."

My PTSD is quite disabling already, but never like this. It has never really been addressed medically due to more pressing issues regarding my mental state, which arose way before the trauma did. 

I have been accepted for EMDR therapy though, and had my initial assessment a few days ago. I never talk about my trauma. I used to be able to get the flashbacks out of my head before they caused any real damage, I was really really good at running from it, blocking it out, and being in complete denial. I've struggled to leave the house lately, and have completely shut down, but NEVER have I suffered this badly from PTSD in eleven years. 

I took a bunch of Valium before the EMDR assessment appointment and let it all spill out, everything I could remember. That night, I had my first in depth, distressing, full on and unstoppable flashback attack that I had refused to let happen when it should have happened years ago. 

Full on pale, sweating, shaking, dissociated, banging my head to stop the visions kind of thing. Could hardly walk, thought I was dying. This has now happened two nights in a row. If it happens again tonight, I don't know how I'll cope. 

In the past, I've had a lot of issues with Valium, Xanax and Klonopin. I have stopped buying street Klonopin and Xanax, nobody will legally script them to me either. I've also stopped buying street Valium, but I still get it prescribed by any means necessary, and currently have a surplus from a script happy dentist. 

These days, I'm doing better with the benzos. Recently, I've had two small slips after almost a year sober from alcohol. But I'm terrified if it happens again soon, I will either get completely and utterly fucked up, or I might break completely. 

I've been having thoughts about refusing to drink any liquids and waiting to die, and it scares me, because I love control, I have to be in control all the time, and I am controlling enough of myself and others to be able to stick to dehydration as a method of ending my life. Obviously, I will sedate myself to within an inch of my life until I can see a mental health professional. 

But until then. I need something. A PDF of a workbook or popular self help book, resources that have helped any of you guys, printable. I'm so scared. And almost angry at myself for seeking treatment. Because although I can't bare living with such anxiety and avoidance, I also can't bare facing up to and reliving my trauma.

I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.

 I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.

My father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to ""discuss"" it. ""Discussion"" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining ""how things are""- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to ""misunderstand"", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a ""discussion"". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.

This was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing ""privilegies"" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and ""llike you mean it"". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.

Sometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.

I was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.

Limited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.

My friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.

I realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.

5c966ef941172c00165d6fc5	920_ptsd	"sometimes I wish I was raped Now before you start typing about how I shouldn't say that and I could never want something like that to happen to me, I want you to hear me out.

When I was little. about 6 or 7ish, something happened to me. And ever since then I still don't know if I can call it sexual assault, sexual abuse, or just a bad experience. There are several reasons I don't know what to call it. I was young but so was he. He was four hears older but I know that he knew what he was doing. But at the same time he only would have been 10 or 11 at the time. I never said no, I never said stop, and when I told him he was heavy or that something hurt or was going too far he stopped. But yet again, I was only 6 or 7 and I just thought if felt good. I remember him telling me not to tell my mom or dad, and it happened more than once. I enjoyed it at the time though, It felt good. No intercourse actually happened, but there was a lot of grinding and touching. He had me watch him ""do his thing"" and asked if I would do it too and when I said no he didn't make me.

The thing is though, I still see this person all of the time and I will for the rest of my life probably. We have never talked about it, but I don't even know if he'd remember it. This person has always been violent and has a history of abusing my parents and me physically, along with ""anger management"" classes when he was about 10 or 13, I don't really remember. That's another thing. I don't really remember all that happened, it was over ten years ago. I remember some of it but not all of it.

Now this is why I wish I had been raped. When I was in the fifth grade I started self harming. Not cutting, I hadn't even heard of that. Instead I would dig my nails into my skin and scratch until I bleed, this happened whenever I thought about what happened because I thought I did something wrong. After I told my friend (Who I'm still extremely close with to this day) about it I kind of just forgot about it every few months until when I started to hit puberty and feel sexual about anything. This was about seventh grade. I had just learned what rape was and then I remembered what happened to me and I wrote it down in my diary. The nexy day I blacked it all out with a marker.

In eighth grade I had a male teacher for homeroom who taught many of my classes. I would feel constant anxiety when he walked around the room because even the thought of him coming behind me scared me so much I was shaking. Now the weird part was he was my favorite teacher and at the time my favorite adult. So sometimes I would stay up from lunch and talk to him about anxiety and such. But at the same time, I was scared out of my mind that he was going to do something to me. Now keep in mind, this was the most innocent, sweetest teacher, nicest adult and teacher I knew at the time, and yes he was a history teacher, fulfilling the stereotype. But Even though I trusted him more than pretty much anyone at the time, I still was in a constant state of fear when he walked around the room. I thought putting myself in uncomfortable situations like seeing him during lunch would help me to trust him more and it actually did. Things got better, even though I never did tell him what had happened when I was little. in eighth grade a started to scratch myself more and a few of my friends noticed. It was on and off but by then end of the year I had stopped.

When high school started I was a nervous wreck. I was starting a new school where I didn't know anybody. So obviously, little old me began to think that the first friend I made there would be my best friends, so I told a lot of people. By a lot I mean like 7 or 8. Some of them I still talk to, but a lot of them I told because they themselves had been assaulted. So early into freshman year I had my first kiss, which led to my first make out session. Of course I freak out because there's this heavy weight on top of me and I hadn't control anything. My heart started to race and I had a hard time breathing. I was having an anxiety attack. That's when I started cutting. All of freshman year I was cutting on and off. Nowhere anyone could see though. The next few months things got better and worse all the time. One week I'd be fine and the next I'd be scared to go home because the person that did that to me would be back there. About February I had my first boyfriend. I told him about it and whenever I would start freaking out when we were doing something he would be totoally okay with it and just make sure I was okay. Truly a great guy. We broke up after about 9 months. I didn't have a lot of trouble with him sexually but when I did it was bad. We never had sex though. To this day I am still a virgin.

Now I'm a sophomore in high school and for the past few months as I've been pleasuring myself and such, I would start crying. It's not like any of the things I was doing to myself he had done to me, but I would constantly think of someone, him, another man, holding me against my will and raping me or forcing me to do things. What happened to me was not anywhere this close to extreme, and sometimes I feel like I just need to get over myself and deal with it because nothing really bad happened. But something did happen, and Sometimes I feel like it was my fault and I was in the wrong and I wasn't abused or anything and it was just kids being kids. But on the other hand I remember him knowing exactly what to do and how to make himself feel good.

I know he took advantage of me. But cutting since fifth grade and being in a constant state of fear of my eighth grade history teacher doesn't add up from what he did. It's not like he forced me to do anything. I've read so many articles, I've contacted Planned Parenthood and RAINN chatrooms asking them if I'd even been abused. They all said that's up for me to decide. Maybe it wasn't the thing that happened to me though. Maybe it was the fact that he would hit my mom my dad and me and that put the fear into my head. I don't know what caused it but I feel like I'm overreacting but I just can't help the anxiety and the tears and the thought of some man inside of me whenever I touch myself. But it just doesn't add up.

I do sometimes wish I was raped. It would make life clearer. It might cause more trauma but at least I would know it wasn't my fault. At least I would know it was assault or I would know it was abuse. at least I would have the courage to tell an adult and not have them judge me thinking that I was just some horny kid who messed around with a family member because I was such a horny child. I would know why I feel so exposed and preyed on. Because right now I have no idea why I feel this sort of... I don't even know if you can call it PTSD.

I know people who have been raped will tell me to never wish this upon myself but I really do. It might make my life harder, but I won't have to question everything I do and think to myself that I'm an attention seeker even when I never told anybody some of this information. If you still feel as though you need to tell me I'm a terrible person, go right ahead. I already feel guilty about this feeling."

I was severely manipulated by my ex to believe things on top of being sexually abused and emotionally.

Right now I am suffering from feeling guilty (blaming myself for being manipulated), ashamed, feeling like my life is unclean etc.. mostly due to the manipulation. Is PTSD a possible culprit?

I have a supportive boyfriend who does everything and more to reassure me that manipulation wasn't my fault, that I was young.. that I was dependent and would believe anything my ex said. I still feel guilty, like it's all my fault. I am looking to know if anyone else had experiences like this.

I do a lot for him: I take care and protect him, and in the end, he still doesn't trust me. We've both come to the conclusion that when I want something and he doesn't want it, he's not willing to find a happy medium whatsoever. It's just non-negotiable. I'm not sure what to do honestly. He doesn't trust me as much as I wish he did. Honestly, sometimes I feel like his enemy, and it kills me.

Hi Reddit! Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.

I've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs. The problem is that my current primary therapist (seeing her for a year) doesn't believe in diagnoses. She believes I'm able to get past everything that has happened so I can function like a ""normal"" person. She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. 

Am I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? 

TL;DR:
Severe C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled. Am I overreacting or do I need to find a new therapist?"
