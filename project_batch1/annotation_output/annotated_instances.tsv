634e1076f43266192b130e13	2421_ptsd	"What if my hurt and issues (disorganised attachment) stem from an innaccurate perception of my memories about my parents? so uuuuuuuh yeah this post carries a content warning for parental abuse, chiefly physical, I think?

I'm 27, a trans woman, pre-anything, and I'm in therapy. I initially started going because I felt like I generally needed support with being almost entirely closeted outside of the net and needing help with getting the support of my parents. The more I stayed on the more the subject became 'me' overall, and over the year or so I've been in therapy now it's the most productive it's been, rather than just doing tunnel vision on a specific problem. She's on leave right now.

I ended up describing some difficulties I was having with relationships and even just general socialising and it lead to us doing the adult attachment interview. In the course of that, I was describing stuff with my parents. I described some particular incidents where I remembered being pushed against a hard plastic prop in a theme park when I was a kid, another when my mother screamed at me and threw my own shoes at me, and another where I remembered her grabbing me, spinning me around and shoving me onto a curb before storming away. In each of these instances, I had been annoying them prior in some fashion, or misbehaving. There's probably a few others, but those stood out.

I told my therapist about how I would remember these events, rather vividly, every few weeks or so and that the more I talked about my parents over the sessions - which took some effort, as I would avoid the subject earlier on - the more frequently I thought about them. And apparently that, uh...apparently that's not normal? Prior, I had just assumed it was normal to keep remembering stuff like that. We got to the end of the interview, over the course of 3 sessions because I kept crying during it. High on anxiety, high on avoidance. Congratulations. It's a Fearful-Avoidant.

We continued talking about these things, still do. It was the first time someone referred to what I went through as incidences of abuse. I would always just say to myself, before this, that I couldn't have been abused because my parents cared about me, or it didn't count as abuse because it was inconsistent, because I was never routinely or ritualistically beaten, or that it didn't count because I deserved it.

A few weeks ago, my mother accused me of disrespecting her after not responding to some asinine suggestion. I ended up being made to sit in front of my parents and made to tell them why I will talk about things to a therapist without telling them. So I was upfront about it - 'you have a history of treating me with anger and violence'.

I was immediately met with incredulity. I was made to outline the events. I named them. One of them - the shoes - she said she didn't remember.  Two others - spinning me around and put to the curb, and being shoved against a prop at Legoland - she says I was misremembering. The former, she just pushed me away because I was being (her words) 'such a horrid thing', the latter, she says I fell and they were helping me up (I have cerebral palsy, balance issues - results in overprotective helicopter parents, to boot). Now, I'm not going to say she was wrong. These were years ago. More than a decade. Nearly two decades in one instance. And every time you remember something, you make an imperfect photocopy of it. My perception, built up over the years as I somehow drifted further and further from my parents, may not be perfect.

She then went on to ask me if I remembered one time that she definitely did hit me - I said I didn't. She explains an instance where she slapped me, because I was misbehaving, and she was mortified afterwards. 'See, you're remembering it wrong, it's all made up.' I felt like we were approaching something, because at least here she was admitting, of her own accord, to some wrongdoing.

Then, she said 'It was probably even just the shock of it then, I didn't hurt you.' My face fell. She admits to actually hitting me once, then justifies it with simultaneous 'you deserved it' and 'it wasn't even a real hit'.

That's the thing that kept me grounded. That wasn't okay. It wasn't okay to justify it. It wasn't okay to effectively corner me and make me spill the beans over what's going on in therapy because I'm seen as property. But still, the doubt remains - what if I'm wrong about this stuff that happened to me? What if I'm remembering it a certain, innaccurate way, and it's colouring my perception of everything else?

Even if my memories are wrong, though, the effects are there. I struggle with relationships. In bad days I dread getting up and seeing my parents. I feel anxious at mealtimes when I have to be near them. I am very apprehensive about the notion of going on vacation with them. I had trouble talking about them in therapy and when my therapist suggested a roleplay for tackling a subject, I just locked up and couldn't do it. That shit just doesn't come from nowhere, right? And if you want to look at fearful-avoidance as springing from your primary caregivers simultaneously giving you a lot of love and a lot of pain, well that day, where I'm being held and told that they'll 'support me' as a trans person while justifying and denying shit that my mother did to did to me, all from effectively forcing me to answer questions (understand, 'leave the room' is not something that presents itself as an option in my mental landscape) and prioritise my mother's pain over 'being disrespected' above all else, *that's* a big fucking dose of that.

Sorry for the long post. It's just all so fucked."

So I think watching a crime show today where a woman was sexually harassed and not taken seriously, then hurt badly, triggered me? I am pretty sure it was mostly due to my own trauma including being sexually assaulted and then the DA office not taking me seriously at all is why I got kinda upset. And I will admit, I haven't worked much on that trauma since I'm also bipolar and those symptoms often take precedence over my PTSD. 

But it's been a few hours since the show and now I'm jumpy as *hell*. My poor nephew thinks I'm mad at him for making noise and potentially waking up his baby sister, but I am just startled as fuck when he is making loud noises unintentionally. I hope this goes away soon, I hate feeling so tense when I have no real reason to be. I just needed to get this out of my system. Thank you anyone who reads this."

When I was 15 I was sexually assaulted for the the first time at park that is very close to my house. I unfortunately have to drive pass it almost everyday to get to work, the store etc+.
Even though it’s been almost 6 years I can’t shake the feeling of going to panic mode and feeling absolutely sick every time I have to drive by it. Also due to being a small town there’s not really many alternative routes I can take to avoid it.
Luckily when ever ever my friends have ask if I ever want to go to that park (or almost any park for that matter bc a lot of the local parks in my town I associate with traumatic memories) they don’t pry and ask why.
I guess what I’m looking for is any advice to could possibly help alleviate any anxiety from this.

I never told anyone of my abuse until I was in my 20s, but even then I didn’t deal with it. I didn’t date until I was out of high school because I was so uncomfortable around men. If I ever met someone that didn’t scare me, I KNEW they must have been a good person, because that NEVER happened! It wasn’t until I turned 30 that I went to a therapist and started to deal with what happened to me. I am finally living a somewhat normal life.

I’ve been in therapy for a little over a month now and was finally told that I have PTSD from the sexual abuse I dealt with when I was a child. No one in my family knows about what I’ve been through—my mom is actually still married to the man who abused me. I have told my current boyfriend about it as well as a few friends over the years but it has always been a secret. 

I perseverate on it daily and it has had an effect on every aspect of my life. I’m happy I’m making progress in addressing it in therapy and working on healing.

However, I want to tell my brother and maybe my sister about it more than anything. My brother (27M) lives on his own and is fairly independent. However, like everyone else in my life, loves and respects my abuser (he is extremely charismatic). My sister (21F) is my abuser’s daughter (we share the same mom though) and I often wonder if she was subjected to the same abuse I went through. She deals with anxiety but seems to have a good relationship with him so I’m really unsure. She also still lives at home so I don’t want to put her in danger either.

Let's start with last week. I contacted Amazon over a pretty simple request. I'm on disability and didn't receive my cheque for December. I've been scraping by for that month and this by dumpster diving and panhandling. Merry Christmas to me I guess. At any rate, I contacted Amazon customer service with an off hand request. I had gotten a Prime trial and asked them if they could extend it for a month for free. I explained the situation. Didn't expect anything from it at all, but the reaction I got was weird. The person I was chatting to on their website started asking for order numbers. I said nevermind and ended the chat. 13 hours later he emails me to say he didn't understand what I was talking about and said to contact again. So I did. Weirdly, the second person was like ""No problem, done. Go enjoy The Grand Tour!"" So I tried to get on Prime and it didn't work. Figured I'd let it be for a couple days. 

While waiting, my roommate comes back. He left in November to go to India for the holidays. I forgot how much noise he made. He's on the phone at all hours of the day and night. He often puts the other person on speaker phone and will yell his responses. I can't sleep. I mean I can't afford my medication to sleep properly anyway, but this asshole is so fucking loud that I couldn't sleep if I did have the meds. I've gotten maybe 2-3 hours sleep since he returned last week. I turned the music on once at 10AM and he had the nerve to tell me to turn it down. That pissed me off even more. 

While all this is going on, I'm waiting for the government to tell me what happened to my disability cheque. They keep saying they're doing investigations and will have another sent out as soon as it's done, but that does fucking nothing for me. We don't have food stamps here so I can't go get that. Food bank is miles away and my knees are fucked, so getting there is hell to begin with and coming back takes multiple hours. Even if I did get there, I don't have a current statement from the government with my address on it because they didn't send the goddamned cheque. 

So I go back to Amazon. Prime still isn't working. So Customer Service tells me it's just a glitch and they'll reach out to me in 12 hours. They do. 12 hours later they say I never had prime to begin with. So I contact customer service AGAIN. This time I get someone who calls me darling every 3 seconds despite me asking repeatedly for her to knock it off. She says that they did give me an extension on the prime but it was an extension of nothing because the prime was already over. She then hangs up on me. So I say fuck it and tweet Amazon. They respond and ask what's wrong. I explain. At this point I don't care about the free prime. I had no right to it anyway, I always thought it was a longshot, but being told a half dozen different things is just bizarre and confusing. They then don't respond for a day. So I say ""Uh hello?"" And another amazon rep comes on twitter to ask what's wrong. I explain again. No response. Today, 4 days later, I say that it's the worst service I've received. Amazon immediately jumps on and gives me a link to contact. I do and don't even get a chance to explain. The dude just says another department will reach out to me.

We have no mail and no one else has gotten mail in the neighborhood. We live next door to a Canada Post and have never had this problem before. Maybe it's the weather? No. People across the road got their mail. Just that we didn't. So no cheque for me today despite being told I'd get it today. That means no eating today, no meds today, no paying bills today.

634e1076f43266192b130e13	580_ptsd	"Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. 

Going to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. 

I was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.

I dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. 

I dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.

Honestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.

I feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. 

It's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. 

But still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. 

I'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.

I know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. 

**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks. I have a therapist appointment on friday, but a recent appointment with my psychiatrist, where he absently dismissed a diagnosis of PTSD as being 'purely academic' has me nervous about bringing it up with my therapist."

634e1076f43266192b130e13	1504_ptsd	"Telling about the abuse Warning, possible triggers!

When I was 12, I was groomed and molested by my Grandfather. Admittedly this is really hard for me to write down as I've yet to really accept and work through what has happened. Even if it's been 6 years. 

2 months ago I was watching a Video about psychology (as I do almost everyday) and the topic was about the Sexual abuse that can occur with children without them realising that what's happening is wrong and scarring. That hit the nail in the coffin and the realisation hit me like a train. I wanted to throw up, curl in a ball and scream, and cry.... After 2 months of torture on my part I finally told my mum. While this happened my grandfather(abuser) frequently visits and calls almost everyday. I get panic attacks everytime it's brought up or if I'm reminded of it in some way... The guilt and shame is killing me. So it's really hard for me to express and talk about my feeling about my... Situation

I can't take it anymore. I can't stand to even think about that pedophile let alone be in the same room as him. So I've cut off ties, not answering the phone or hiding etc. My grandmother started meddling (It's typical behaviour for that part of the family) and won't stop asking questions no matter how much I tell her to leave it. So she started asking my dad questions and he doesn't take well to them. 

So this brings me to my current dilemma. I don't know if I should tell my father and/or How I should tell him. I'm stuck in a corner and this could destroy my family. I don't even know if they'll believe me or not! My family sort of despise me because I'm Granddaddy's favourite (ain't that ironic?) 

Mum really helps a lot but she's not always there to help me out of the situations. So I'm turning to you for advice, Reddit. 

Please, any advice on this would be greatly appreciate. I know this might not be the best subreddit to ask this but.... You're my only hope now."

Rape, sexual assault, and PTSD do not know fame, race, or gender. At any given time, over 13 MILLION Americans have PTSD. Meanwhile, over 14,000 military members report sexual assault every year.

It’s estimated that 83% of military sexual assaults go unreported, meaning there could be upwards of 82,500 military sexual assaults happening PER YEAR. Since my own military sexual assault in the Marines, 3 months before 9/11, there have been approximately 1.4 MILLION other victims in the military alone. 

Over the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of joining and chatting with numerous social media groups formed to support PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors.

There are thousands in these groups, yet there are millions more suffering on their own. PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.

To show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.

My story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.

In my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.

In the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain. After years on this journey, I have decided to write a book about my experience.

This book is currently in pre-order sales and will be for the next 24 hours. The journey offers some parallels to The Alchemist and Forrest Gump, though this journey is true.

Your support would go a long way to ensure this story gets told and the conversation around PTSD really gets started. [https://publishizer.com/relentless-1/](https://publishizer.com/relentless-1/) . 

Help me help the masses understand this condition so that the silent suffering of millions can end.

I have also been dissociating really badly, as in constantly, for the past few months because I was triggered badly right before. I feel like it doesn’t count because ptsd is such a serious illness and it wasn’t any kind of cut and dry traumatic event, and what if I’m just being silly and these sorts of flashbacks are just normal? Does anyone have a similar situation or any words of advice? I’m talking to my therapist about it and since she’s a bipolar specialist I think I might look elsewhere to look for a diagnosis or other treatment. Thanks for reading :)

My SO has been really distant with everyone he knows lately and it began to worry me and everyone else. I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his ""voice"". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend ""Jay's"" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.

The next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with ""Jay"". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.

Back when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. 



I knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. 


Earlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a ""shooting in the woods"" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. 

And then this happened.

I'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.

I don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know."

New member here. 
Basically went through some very rough stuff throughout childhood and witnessed very scary domestic abuse between my parents. Lots of yelling (my dad can be very scary) hitting in front of me, etc.
To this day my parents are still married and the physical fighting has subsided, yet they will still get into a yelling/ door slamming match every now and then that just sends me into tears despite being 20 years old. I still hate all forms of yelling/voice raising. Even when my mom is just calling a sibling from the other room, I shudder at the sound of just her yelling. 

The other night, I was smoking with my sister and her friends. I used to be a frequent smoker, nearly everyday mostly and every single day occasionally for a few months here and there, mostly to deal with depression and such. However we were taking dabs, which I have taken before without this effect, but clearly I got much more high a lot quicker than from a bowl or blunt. Anyway, I proceeded to go lay on the couch in my basement and I SWORE I could hear my dad clear as day screaming at my mom. I knew I was super high and scared, but over and over I would hear his voice in my head. I went upstairs and checked, they were completely fast asleep.

I might remember the fact that I went somewhere but I won't actually be able to recall a memory about it. There's just nothing there. I've always been this way (I know not because of memories but because of stories I've told myself). I never really thought about it being weird until I was in college but now I I know it's definitely not the norm. I have ptsd but I don't actually remember what happened. I grew up in an abusive home until I was 17.

Does anyone else experience this? Particularly to the degree of nothing being remembered? I feel. Like a walking amnesiac.

Questions are welcome."	[]	[{'start': 77, 'end': 122, 'span': ' remember anything, nothing episodic at least', 'annotation': 'uncertain'}, {'start': 638, 'end': 649, 'span': 'I have ptsd', 'annotation': 'uncertain'}]
5cc8a6914763ee0016afa155	408_ptsd	"This feels so minor after writing it but I need to get it out. While taking a practice LSAT, I had a question come up that triggered a flashback. It threw me off for the rest of my test... this feels like such a set back. I had to abandon my career associated with my undergrad degree after being blackballed from the industry by a scheming boss lady and the pond scum of a coworker who assaulted me and mentally and emotionally messed with me. After a year of suffering anxiety, depression, flash backs, nightmares, and various SN responses to certain places, people, thoughts, I’ve had the chance to process and work through via therapy and journaling. 

I made my decision to pursue a law degree that I was on the fence about. The LSAT is ranked out of 180 points with a 165 being high enough to get you in to most schools. The first LSAT practice exam I took I scored a 152. This last one, I hit a question that stated in quotations something that was said to me upon my termination, and I dove deep into memory lane. My mind started racing and I felt flighty and nervous all of a sudden and started rushing through the test just wanting to escape. I didn’t complete that section and did horrendous on what should’ve been my best session. I only got a 142. 

Of course these are just practice exams and not the end all be all; however, my GPA is not too great considering I spent most of my final semester coping... I need that high score to get in to law school. 

I’m so scared that something like this will happen on the actual test day next month. I’ve never been set off by something so small before and thought I was doing significantly better- even my therapist has increased the time between our sessions. I’m mad at myself because this is still getting to me. I don’t want them to have control over me any longer and I sure as heck do not want this to put another career in jeopardy for me. 

I never want another intrusive thought. I just want to process and move on."	[{'start': 387, 'end': 444, 'span': 'assaulted me and mentally and emotionally messed with me.', 'annotation': 'trauma'}]	[]
5cc8a6914763ee0016afa155	824_counseling	Hi Calgary (Canada!),  Let me get this straight...you're in a 'relationship', but he might be married. You both cheat and lie and he's abusive. The short answer is that there is too much wrong here for this therapist to try and fix it. Relationships don't heal us and they don't help us grow up. We have to be mature and stable enough to love someone before it's going to work. I'd recommend you focus on yourself alone for a while. You have a lot to sort out. I wish you the best.

5cc8a6914763ee0016afa155	109_ptsd	"I think i cured my violent sexual trauma and ""fetish"" by getting it to happen to me again. Is this possible? Is it sick? Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it ""rape"" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.


 At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).


I hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be ""real raped, choked"" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.


2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming ""OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP"" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.


Over the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???


TL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick ""fetish"". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."

5cc8a6914763ee0016afa155	2459_ptsd	Going to trial... Today I found out that the guy who assaulted me pleaded not guilty and my case is moving forward to a bench trial. I feel so physically sick and repulsed by the fact that nearly a year and over 5 court dates later, he's still unwilling to own up to what he's done to me. Just when I thought that I would never have to see him again (I transferred schools) I find out that I have to face him in court. The mere thought of this has lead me to feel like my lungs are collapsing and my entire body feels weak and defeated. Going to trial means re-experiencing my trauma all over again, except with him present to see just how much damage he did to me. I don't want him to see how much he has destroyed me and taken my piece of mind. I don't want him to get the sick satisfaction of seeing me cry but I know that going through a trial will bring me to tears. I fear that seeing him again will retraumatize me in a way and undo the progress that I have made in therapy. Any advice or simply kind words would be appreciated.

5cc8a6914763ee0016afa155	525_ptsd	Are my symptoms reason for concern? To give you some backstory I used to use drugs heavily for around 2 years. Around a year in I started to deal in order to bring in money. The most memorable deal of my life was being thrown out of a moving car. I was on the outside, he grabbed the drugs and I (stupidly) grabbed onto the car and tried to get it back. The driver hit around 30 mph and the passenger shoved me out of the car. I have permanent mental and physical scars from this incident. I find it incredibly hard to trust anybody (I only trust around 3 people completely) and I hate being in public. I'm constantly paranoid and looking around myself while in public. I worry about people seeing me, and a lot of other silly reasons. After browsing this sub it made me realize that I have similar symptoms. It's not to the point to where it has a major impact in my life but I'm still curious and wish to seek help. Thanks in advance, stay safe guys.

5cc8a6914763ee0016afa155	1272_ptsd	"I don't want my partner to be near me when I need his help most. (semi vent?) I have PTSD to needles. I also have an anaphylactic allergy to most animals. I am terrified of my own Epi pen.  
Last time I had a major attack I fought tooth and nail while suffocating to not have an epi-pen used on me. Thankfully my regular doctor was there and he was brave enough to administer the drug into the oxygen that was being pumped into my throat - a less effective treatment that could have gotten him into trouble.   
My partner looks after my epi-pen at home and has warned me that if I have another attack he will use it on me. This is hard, just remembering its in the house somewhere gives me stress, but the worst thing is the thought of him being there when I'm suffering.

The thing I am scared of is associating *him* with my fear. I don't want to loose trust of my partner. I've lost trust of being in the car with my mother if I don't know exactly where we are going, I've lost trust of entering buildings I'm not familiar with beforehand. I don't want to be unable to trust someone I've shared a life with for 5 years.  
I've told him that if I ever need a needle for any reason I don't want him in the room. I don't want him near me. I'd rather he run away and leave me alone with strangers than stay by my side to try and help.  
Does anyone else have similar problems to this? Is that the wrong thing to expect from him?   
I can't convince him to not use an epipen on me to save my life, he's not going to let me die if a dog touches me, but... I don't know what to do about that. It's hard to think about for long. I feel conflicted."	[]	[{'start': 85, 'end': 100, 'span': 'PTSD to needles', 'annotation': 'uncertain'}]

I've been through some really heavy life events in the last 5 years - a job loss, a serious chronic illness, near-homelessness, a financially abusive relationship with a closet alcoholic, workplace bullying. 

New therapist has been seen for 5 sessions so far and has actually NOT fired me for having ""too complex of history"" so I'm hopeful. 

While we get started, I would like some recommendations on books that deal with PTSD from events like this.
