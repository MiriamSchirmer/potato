{"id": "1664_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Experiencing flashbacks and dissociation? Hi, my name is Liz and I'm a 30 year old woman with a lot of past trauma. Specifically, most of the trauma happened when I was a child living with parents who were abusive to one another and myself. I seem to be having flashbacks to things that have happened in my current relationship though. My partner likes to drink and I do not. I have no problem with anyone drinking around me, it's just that I don't find pleasure in it myself. He has acted in very scary and mean ways while drinking, and even though it has been over a year since he has done anything like this, I seem to be having issues. I lay in bed and sometimes have memories (that prior I didn't remember, or hadn't thought of in a long time) and they feel real. For example: he screamed in my face one time, and I had a memory of it the other night. I felt his voice causing my whole body to shake and rattle. I felt my life being possibly threatened. It took quite some time to shake the residual feelings and go to sleep. \n\nAfter experiencing the flashbacks, or experiencing something he has done, I tend to dissociate. At least I think it's dissociation. I actually welcome it and LIKE the feeling. I just kind of go away. I can't see what's in front of me or hear what people say. I go on autopilot or just stare into nothingness. It almost feels like maybe I'm going cross-eyed, lol. But no one has confirmed this for me. Although, as a child, my teachers would accuse me of \"daydreaming\" all the time. I would try to explain to my mom that I wasn't \"thinking\" of anything. I was just in a daze. She said, well whatever it is, just cut it out, lol. \n\nI like this feeling of being numb or calm and unaware. Is that unusual? Are these signs of PTSD? I really am not sure and just looking for some answers and possibly some people out there who are going through the same.  Most of the time I hear people describe dissociation as an unwanted or unpleasant thing. So, I'm a little confused as to why I welcome the sensation. (Most of the time, unless I'm trying to do something important)\n\nI really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I hope you are doing well during these difficult times.

I can't do that because it doesn't feel like that, speaking from an emotional standpoint.\nI guess I'll just say it was really bad.\nNot so long ago, I broke up with a girl who i guess you could say wasn't the best.\nShe kind of treated me like crap, made me feel like everything was my fault.\nEven looking back and knowing it wasn't, a part of me feels so guilty for something I know wasn't my doing[yet it still feels so].\nShe disregarded my feelings, then up and left for about three months, putting quite a bit in front of me, which I could understand at first.\nYou can't put everything on hold for one person, and I could understand that even at 13-14.(ive just turned 16 a few months ago)\nIt was online, so it's not like she could've drove near me and do anything, but that really didn't make me any less terrified everytime I saw messages of her being blatantly angry with me, being upset with soemthing I might've done wrong or said.\nWe never called much, which I suppose I'm thankful for, but the times we did, I guess it was okay.\nI guess I was terrified of what my parents would think, given they weren't (still kind of aren't) the most supportive.\nMy father was upset when I came out, being that he couldn't quite accept that I'm gay.\nShe led me on though, and for a while.\nShe was really upset when I wouldn't just accept her confession and that she wanted to go out, so i guess I kind of forced myself to liking her just a bit.\nIt all kind of felt rushed, but I was truly in love with her, despite the fact that others would probably say it was just puppy love(I imagine for good reason).\nShe kind of made me think my friends were the bad ones, like she was in the right.\nI gave her three chances, and I accepted her with no hesitation for every one of those.\nI have flashbacks almost every day, I'm kind of terrified to do much or go anywhere near that reminds me of her.\nI can't even say her name without breaking down.\nI've had at least three panic attacks, one being in school to which the teacher had to escort me out and I had to go home.\nThis may be a bit disorganised, and I'm really sorry about that, but my brain is a bit jumbled and I guess this isn't the easiest to think and talk about.\nThis wouldn't be so hard if I didn't hear her, if I didn't see her in my head everytime.\nThe flashbacks aren't just flashbacks to me you know, they literally drag me in to a point at which I'm choking and trying to get out.\nI tend to panic and not get \"out\" of it for a while, and I more often than not, dissociate from my body in a way so it seems.\nI would go into depth a bit more, but I've been told that's what I do whenever I panic that way by an old therapist.\nThe memories aren't really in order, and I don't think I can remember specific things because they're going so fast, maybe?...\nI don't think fast is the right word, but they're kind of just thrown at me all at once.\nI can phsycially feel her, hear her sometimes, and being shizoafective doesn't help at all.\nI'm so utterly frustrated at the fact that I'm unable to let go, but I don't think my family would deem it \"normal\" for me to say that there are memories holding me down or anything like that.\nThey wouldn't really understand, unfortunately.\nI haven't told anyone about this but a friend who has been here from beginning to now with this whole ordeal, given my family's reaction won't be anywhere near supportive.\nI'm going to a placement centre sometime soon, but I don't know when.\nI'm terrified that I'm just overreacting, you know.\nI'm terrified that a part of me just \"wants\" this in a way, like I deserve this.\nAgain, I really apologise for the mess, I'm not the most organised when it comes to my emotions and such.\nShe told me she was sorry and it was heavily implied that she, at the very least, attempted suicide.\nHow am I supposed to handle that?..\nEverytime I think about it, I just think about the fact that this is just\nIt's nothing compared to something else so much worse.\nShe could've been here, you know?..\nPhsycially been here, but she wasn't.\nI know comparing isn't a thing of suggestion with something like this, but I have such a habit and compulsion to do exactly that.\nI feel as though my problems and this is nothing whatsoever.\nI feel pathetic for even being so distraught over it.\nI'll probably delete this because I wouldn't want anyone finding this and making connections, if anyone I know happen to find this.\nI really apologise for this though, I hope I'm not taking up anyone's important time.",

You\u2019re going to be told bluntly, and you will reject it. Perhaps you\u2019ve already been told, by his friends that are no longer his friends for a reason that you should know by now. I couldn\u2019t comprehend it either, not at first. I didn\u2019t understand what information I had just been handed, what it meant and what it was doing to me. Four years later I am still processing what it was and who he is. It still weighs on me as heavy as it did that night, but in a different way.\n\nI mourned my relationship first, I had succumbed to what I thought was love, but was ultimately masterful manipulation. He made it easy to attach myself to him with promises of an appealing future. He had a way of convincing me he was smarter than me, and everyone else. You\u2019ll be okay if you stick with me, the rest of the world is toxic and confused. We\u2019re okay if we just stay here. I love you because you\u2019re practical, you\u2019re not like any other girl I\u2019ve dated. They\u2019re all crazy, you\u2019re sane. You\u2019re grounded, and you pay half of the rent. \n\nHe was secretive to start, a few early discrepancies regarding other girls online. Inexperienced me deemed this normal, we could moved passed all of that noise - what counted was where we ended up each night. He kept nude images of these girls on his phone, we were not off to a great start. But I was practical, I was different, and I made him feel smart. I existed to embellish him, an important role - and he knew it. I was his type; insecure and accustomed to abuse. This particular trauma, however, is not abuse. Though there was plenty, emotional and physical abuse. I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it. He shoved me into a wall when I announced his lack of masculinity too loudly. \n\nHe worked in security at a ballet school, often overnight. Based on the mistrust that was instilled in me early on in our relationship, the overnight work worried me. Is he talking to girls? Is he sending them unsolicited dick pics? Probably. By this point he had convinced me it was in my head, and I was massively paranoid. I was turning into one of the girls he didn\u2019t want to be around, someone insane and impractical. But I paid rent, and contributed towards the idea of a future. I was being molded into someone who would love him no matter what doubts I had. \n\nHe had some performance issues come up at his job. I can\u2019t remember what they were regarding, or if they were even real\u2026But he lost his full time position. He maintained employment with the same company at a different location, part-time. We got by with savings and my serving job. I got a call one day from his manager, Patrick. They had originally tried to call him, and I was listed as his emergency contact. It was not the first time I had received a call from his work, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I was at work when he called so he left a voicemail - I listened to it on my way home from work. He spoke as if he were talking to him, instructing him to call him back - and that they had to cut into all of the lockers at his previous workplace. He listed off a few of the items found in the lockers and wanted to be sure that they were his, and make sure everything was accounted for. There was a laptop, and a safe box. \n\nI asked him about these items but he assured me they weren\u2019t his. I let it go, as I had many things during our time together. He was picking up a few evening shifts where he could at this time, quite sporadically. He would leave around 2 or 4, and return around 10pm. I got cut from work when the dinner shift showed up, around 4:30. I left work, walked south on Bay Street, east on College, and hopped on the northbound train. I got home around 5:15pm. I unloaded, changed into sweats, the usual. Cleaning was pretty relaxing after a day in the service industry, so I went to grab some supplies under the kitchen sink cupboard. Our kitchen counters were L shaped, and I always thought it was weird that where the space under the cupboard should have ended, it extended passed where the wall above sat. This particular evening I noticed that this was not the case, and somehow the wall had moved forward. I was frightened, I was one of those people that ready creepy stories at night - you know the one where people discover there are people living in small spaces in their home. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wall, it was a piece of bristol board. It was relieving for a brief moment - but that relief was short lived. I removed that board and discovered a safe and a laptop. Since that moment I\u2019ve really repressed what I found - through denial or embarrassment, I\u2019ve somehow forgotten in detail what it was I had seen. I still don\u2019t know what journey I set out to after that moment, but it wasn\u2019t to deal with seeing those images. That was my second mistake. My first was my initial thought - the end of my four year relationship. Logic was not present, logic would have been to immediately call the police - instead of waiting for him to come home to confront him about it.* \n\nIf he somehow sees this - he will frantically come up with something to tell you to convince you I am just some crazy ex-girlfriend out to get me for breaking up with me. Or perhaps he has already set something in place to manipulate you into believing that none of this is truth, and anything anyone ever says apart from him is a lie. When I left Toronto, he covered his tracks - and somehow convinced his family and our mutual friends that I was not to be trusted. He was fine, and merely unhappy in our relationship. He never got the help he claimed to seek, he paused his search for child pornography, but not for long. It\u2019s never for very long. Damaged people don\u2019t get better without proper treatment. \n\nI think about this every fucking day. It\u2019s with me, for better or for worse. I think about the children who attended and lived at the ballet school that he worked at - it\u2019s such a privilege for them to be there, a dream. I think about the children that were trafficked and exploited - contributing to his sick obsession. I think about the women who are trafficked in Southern Ontario. I think about his other ex-girlfriend who also knew about this. I think about his family who are under his false influence. But most of all, I think of you. \n\n(*the crime described in this letter has since been reported.)", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2150, "end": 2341, "span": "I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it.
