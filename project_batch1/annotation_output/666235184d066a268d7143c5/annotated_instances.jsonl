{"id": "956_ptsd", "displayed_text": "PTSD court treatment update #2: The Euphoria is wearing off and reality is setting in. It\u2019s not all bad, but it\u2019s not all good. It\u2019s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  \n\nI hid it from the court, because it\u2019s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.\n\nAfter a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.\n\nIn my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.\n\n10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to \u201cjust climb out\u201d.  That fucking pit...\n\nTold the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I\u2019d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. \n\nThankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t want to deal with these people around me who didn\u2019t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn\u2019t want them to feel like me.  It\u2019s one of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you\u2019re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.\n\nTo avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It\u2019s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.\n\nWhat used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I\u2019ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven\u2019t done that since 06\u2019. \n\nAm I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That\u2019s still there right now.  But I\u2019m up.  \n\nI\u2019m doing choirs.  I\u2019m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it\u2019s been since I can remember.\n\nI\u2019ve read over what I\u2019ve written for about 20 min.    \n\nI guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:\n\nI still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I\u2019ll never be \u201cOk\u201d\n\nBUT\n\nThe pit is less deep and it\u2019s easier to climb out. \n\n\n\n", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 154, "end": 231, "span": "4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himsel", "annotation": "trauma"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1145, "span": "I fucking killed someone again", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 1m 15s "}}

The teachers tried to apprehend the two, so I went and grabbed the other one holding him up against the wall.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that I had grabbed the one who didn't want the fight to happen, so when the two boys broke free from the other teachers I ended up being a human shield.

I went to slow down and my body just went completely lifeless, my vision went blurry and was almost as if I was in a Minecraft game (weird I know)\n\nMy second car accident was in August 2017, a year and 4 months AFTER my first accident. I got t-boned on the driver side in a parking lot. I was stopped had my blinker on waiting for him to go by so I can turn left and the man who hit me didn\u2019t have his blinker on but I saw he was turning right. Well he turned right as I barely began to turn left and he came completely in my lane t-boning me. \n\nThen my last most recent accident happened January 2018. I was driving my Ex\u2019s lifted F-250 truck, it was our moving weekend and he worked out of town at the time so he was driving his commuter and I was driving the truck. Well it was raining and we were taking the back roads that lead to the main hwy. Well we were coming up the hill with a slight curve and the speed limit is 45 mph and I was going about 35 mph maybe 40 mph due to it raining and I barely put pressure on the gas during the curve and the bed of the truck starts hydroplane fishtailing.. everything starts going slow motion and the front passenger tire hits a curb and the truck flipped and rolled  5-6 times about 70ft down a steep hill that dropped off into a river. I instantly thought I was going to die in that car accident. \n\nWith those being the accidents I\u2019ve been in I\u2019m absolutely 1,000% terrified to drive on highways, drive in the rain, drive long distance. When I drive on the hwy I constantly feel as if I\u2019m hydroplane fishtailing. I start to lose my breathing, my body goes numb. I absolutely REFUSE to drive in the rain unless I\u2019m in my hometown and not on the 2 main highways. I hate driving long distance because I get a really bad rush of anxiety and feel like something bad is going to happen if I\u2019m driving. \n\nSorry for the long post.

She would hit me for breathing too loud, monitoring everything I did, she joined my bullies at school, she told me everyday I was shit, pathetic and nothing. She ground me down, and every time I see her, I feel total rage and want to scream. I have only been actively triggered by her a few times, and the rest of the time I just get this blind anger and rage when I see something I know she likes (animated Disney movies, Halloween, certain candy brands, etc).\n\nI got sexually assaulted and would relive it in my dreams. I could never see his face, and I still can\u2019t remember it, but I remember his hands. Regularly relived this for about 3 years after it happened, then it stopped. This wasn\u2019t a rape. It was all hands. I always thought it was mild but the effect it has on me for years after Wasn\u2019t mild. \n\nI came out as trans (unrelated to anything else, but being a closeted trans kid wasn\u2019t fun in itself) and I lost friends. A lot of bad stuff went down, fed into stuff from my sister...I don\u2019t want to go into detail, but the world became terrifying and far more dangerous over night, and I lost so many people I loved and I blamed myself for it. I still relive this stuff today.\n\n I tried to kill myself, mostly due to my life falling apart, anxiety and not being able to deal with whatever this is, whether it is ptsd or something else. I messed it up, thought about what my parents would think, and went for help at my local ER. They took me and locked me on a ward and wouldn\u2019t let me leave. I still can\u2019t go into hospitals and I have attacks whIch feel just like I did when they took me in.

I know I should be asking a doctor but honestly, I can\u2019t do it. I would rather die than go back to a hospital.

I remember vaguely one time when i raised my hand in elementary school and was like \u201cmy daddy cusses alot\u201d or something like that and i thought it was funny as i was only in 2nd grade or something. I feel like I completely blocked out my childhood which my therapist said is a sign of ptsd along with other symptoms i will describe later. As i was saying i blocked out alot of my childhood, i remember when i first started going to therapy when i was 13ish they would ask why i thought my childhood was toxic and what happened and I couldn\u2019t ever describe it in detail, this has happened multiple times between switching psychs and therapists and what i think is one of the main reasons a possible diagnosis was delayed for so long. I also have gotten panic attacks since around the same age (13) and currently have a diagnosis of panic disorder which i think will eventually be changed to ptsd. One of the main things that have effected me due to this was my horrible fear of any type of confrontation no matter how big or small even if it doesn\u2019t involve me, like for example say two people i know get into a small fight and you can feel the tension that could possibly cause me to cry or even have a panic attack. Or if it\u2019s a example that directly effects me like someone raising their voice at me, i will always cry without a doubt which has completely disrupted me having a job. This has also caused me to not be able to defend myself at all and i tend to get walked over ALOT and causes me to get in tons of toxic relationships amongst friendships and relationships. I was also sexually assaulted at 16 by a crush at the time and I don\u2019t feel comfortable going into detail with this part but with the toxic childhood I completely blocked it out so I don\u2019t get flashbacks with that trauma. But i know for sure i get flashbacks from the sexual assault I experienced as well as my mom often shaming me for the clothes i wear.

{"id": "916_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Is this PTSD? What do I do? (19 y/o male) About 2 months ago one night  I was delivering a pizza to an apartment building for my job. I left my car door unlocked for convenience when i just walked like 30 steps to the door to deliver it. A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. \nSince then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could\u2019ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I\u2019ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could\u2019ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I\u2019ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don\u2019t really have nightmares.\nI just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it\u2019s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I\u2019ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don\u2019t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I\u2019ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I\u2019ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I\u2019m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I\u2019ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I\u2019m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn\u2019t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn\u2019t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he\u2019s made it clear before that he doesn\u2019t generally prescribe benzodiazepines. What are my options? I desperately need advice. Sorry for the long and badly structured rant by the way.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 285, "end": 449, "span": "i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door.

{"id": "1340_ptsd", "displayed_text": "I really need advice(NSFW) Hi, ive just been looking everywhere for some sort, of assistance or advice. \n\nAbout 2 days ago on shift at the hotel i work at ( I work overnight hotel security in Canada) i got a call to unlock a bathroom door. Normal call we get, women thought her BF locked as he left for a smoke, so as i unlocked it he had hung himself. So i was taken aback took him down checked for breathing or a pulse nothing. Yell over my radio for front desk to call 911 and then began chest compressions. Did this for about 10 minutes till paramedic arrived, then went on for about 15 minutes before calling it. \n\nAt first on that day it didnt feel real, i was kind of in a trance but after trying to sleep all i could see was that scene playing over and over. But after ignoring it at home i felt ok, so today i came into work. But just getting on the bus to come in made me feel stressed, restless, sick. I feel embarrassed and angry about my feeling and i just dont understand myself atm.\n\nSo really looking for some advice.\n\nPs. Sorry for the long winded post just needed to vent.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 313, "end": 353, "span": " so as i unlocked it he had hung himself", "annotation": "trauma"}], "behavioral_data": {"time_string": "Time spent: 0d 0h 0m 36s "}}
