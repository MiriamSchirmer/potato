How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential.  For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint. I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing.

You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love. If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences.

I went to slow down and my body just went completely lifeless, my vision went blurry and was almost as if I was in a Minecraft game (weird I know)\n\nMy second car accident was in August 2017, a year and 4 months AFTER my first accident. I got t-boned on the driver side in a parking lot. I was stopped had my blinker on waiting for him to go by so I can turn left and the man who hit me didn\u2019t have his blinker on but I saw he was turning right. Well he turned right as I barely began to turn left and he came completely in my lane t-boning me. \n\nThen my last most recent accident happened January 2018. I was driving my Ex\u2019s lifted F-250 truck, it was our moving weekend and he worked out of town at the time so he was driving his commuter and I was driving the truck. Well it was raining and we were taking the back roads that lead to the main hwy. Well we were coming up the hill with a slight curve and the speed limit is 45 mph and I was going about 35 mph maybe 40 mph due to it raining and I barely put pressure on the gas during the curve and the bed of the truck starts hydroplane fishtailing.. everything starts going slow motion and the front passenger tire hits a curb and the truck flipped and rolled  5-6 times about 70ft down a steep hill that dropped off into a river. I instantly thought I was going to die in that car accident. \n\nWith those being the accidents I\u2019ve been in I\u2019m absolutely 1,000% terrified to drive on highways, drive in the rain, drive long distance. When I drive on the hwy I constantly feel as if I\u2019m hydroplane fishtailing. I start to lose my breathing, my body goes numb. I absolutely REFUSE to drive in the rain unless I\u2019m in my hometown and not on the 2 main highways. I hate driving long distance because I get a really bad rush of anxiety and feel like something bad is going to happen if I\u2019m driving. \n\nSorry for the long post. I\u2019ve tried all the grounding techniques, having lavender scented air fresheners/ essential oil in my car, talking to myself and telling myself I\u2019m okay. Does anyone else have this problem?
