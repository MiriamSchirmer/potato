{"id": "94_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Wondering if I should get checked for PTSD from familial violence I'm 21, male, and during my childhood I was constantly tormented by 3 people, my dad, my brother, and my aunt. I'd never consider myself to potentially have PTSD but looking up symptoms online made me have a second thought about it. \n\nMy 15-year-older-than-me brother choked me several times during my childhood, possibly with the intent of killing me, because he wouldn't let go until someone would intervene. He started choking me when I was 12, which would make him in his mid 20s. He was NEET back then and still is. He also tortured me in several other ways, like subduing me and pressing his knee into my temple or heatbutting me in the nose as a way to start a fight. I started taking martial arts and self defense classes and I started retaliating against him, when I was around 15. He'd also hit my mom sometimes and I'd protect her. One time while trying to avoid his chokes I cut my head so bad that blood was gushing all over the room - and when I got him off me, he came back and headbutted me in the nose and tried to choke me again, after which I threw him over the table. The whole room was covered in my blood and he was still relentless.\n\nMy aunt had epilepsy and blamed it at me since I was 10. She refused to take meds for it because of me and I'd have to take care of her epilepsy attacks since I was 10, a lot of the times I was home alone with her. Sometimes she'd bang her head and get a huge swelling or blood would be pooling out of her head and I had to take care of her alone countless times. Sometimes after the seizures she'd get really confused, almost insane, babble, take her clothes off and try to go off etc, and I had to stop that. Also, watching someone twitch and curl up and their eyes roll up isn't exactly a pleasant thing to watch, especially as a kid.\n\n6 months ago I beat my brother up, choked him until snot was coming out of his eyes because he was threatening my mom and she finally kicked him out. I'm finally free from his constant threat of violence but I still feel really weird from time to time.\n\nMy aunt also had her last epilepsy attack around a few months ago, because the doctor said the next one might kill her because it's taking a toll on her heart. Still blames me for it though.\n\n----------\n\nMy \"symptoms\":\n\nI know this probably isn't nothing compared what other people go through. I even thought this didn't affect me, I thought most people go through either the same or worse, until I was about 20 years old.\n\nBut once every day, or every 2-3 days, I get intense, intrusive memories about these events. I feel extreme anger and hate, my heart rate goes sky high, sometimes even my hands start shaking. I feel like I can't stop thinking about it, sometimes for an hour or two.\n\nThis usually happens when I'm trying to study or sometimes it even happens while I'm listening to a lecture at my university. Sometimes at the university I just zone out and kind of relive these events, going though them in my head. Other than that, when I'm not going through this, I have a tough time concentrating. I think \"episodes\" happens when I get bored or when my mind isn't stimulated. Like, I don't think they happen if I distract myself with the Internet or doing some hobby that I like.\n\n I remember feeling like this at least once a week ever since I was around 15 or so.\n\n  I used to have nightmares about either fighting for life with my brother or my dad or someone else, or about seizures happening to me or people around me every day. Now I have them maybe once a week or two.\n\nI get something that feels like an adrenaline rush when I'm bringing this up, for instance as I'm writing this, or when my brother decides to visit my mom, and sometimes it just happens randomly.\n\nDoes this sound like PTSD or at least a reason to visit a mental health professional? I honestly thought PTSD accompanied a lot more brutal traumatic experiences, like what you'd hear in war stories.\n\nAlso, I think I've had social anxiety for the better part of my life, but I think that's getting better now.\n\nDoes \"reliving a traumatic experience\" necessarily mean you feel all the sensations you felt back then? Or is it enough to emotionally experience it again?\n\nHow do I know if this is PTSD or just some normal reaction?\n\nEdit: I just realized the backstory and the traumatic events might not have been necessary, sorry about that.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 303, "end": 743, "span": "My 15-year-older-than-me brother choked me several times during my childhood, possibly with the intent of killing me, because he wouldn't let go until someone would intervene.

Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. \n\nI developed PTSD as a consequence.

I just decided to make a new account since I couldn't hold this in any longer.  \nTrigger warning for some; child sexual abuse, crude jokes  \nI recently went through an involuntary hospitalization (related to perceived suicidal ideation) and some of my typical behaviours and quirks caused a psychologist to take me aside and ask if I potentially had PTSD. I assumed she wanted this information to diagnose me or put it on my precautions sheet\\*. While curious, I prompted her to share why she thought so, and she replied with, \"I noticed you've been very startled at loud noises throughout the day. At times, you would stare into space and that concerned me.\" Now, I was curious. Although I had a fair share of PTSD-knowledge, I mostly comforted myself with the fact that a lot of them are veterans and just...nullified the possibility of me having it.   \nNow, the quirks I demonstrated were, as aforementioned, me jumping at loud noises and loud voices, being sensitive to touch, and also a strange blanking out.

There is an ongoing complex intense court battle between the 2 of them and her family (who admittedly have always been distant) have chosen to side with the father and isolate/ostracize my friend. She has been on and off again homeless, and because of this, she made the healthy decision to move in with me and has become apart of my family. \nI love my friend, she desperately wants to overcome this but is struggling with a lot of symptoms, and myself and my parents want to learn how to help her any way we can. \nShe has these dreams where she wakes up panicking and sweating. Last time she told me that she couldnt stop going over what happened in her head, and although i stayed with her, it took a long time for her to fall back asleep.\nShe also has flashbacks where she goes in and out of the present and past. For example last week after volleyball she was triggered by the noisy change room and ended up standing in the corner unresponsive to anyone repeating the words \"its my fault\". I ended up getting her alone away from the rest of the team but i need strategies on how to get her out of the flashback. Ive noticed that when shes a present the hypersensitivity kicks in and everythings crazy loud for her but then she cant hear anything when shes back in her flashback. Sometimes it helps to give a hug or hold her hand sometimes it terrifies or irritates her. I dont know how to get her out of it and i hate to see her that terrified. \nThe hypersensitivity can be super hard too around the house, sometimes shes able to say that something like the dryer is too loud otherwise we'll find her in the corner of her room with her head between her legs in a panic attack. \nWe desperately want strategies to help bring her out of a flashback/dissociation, panic attack, night terrors and just the general feeling of loneliness and betrayal she deals with daily. Also note we just started her with a counsellor who she says is helping a lot, this is just for at home and school. Really and insight into ptsd would be super helpful as were all still trying to comprehend it. \nThanks", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 90, "end": 196, "span": "my 16 year old friend just came out about sexual and physical abuse from her asshole father 2 months ago.

{"id": "81_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Trigger warning, 18+ Sexual Content I was raped. I've only had abusive sexual intercourse or unwanted sex etc. Until my recent relationship. \n\nIt's ruining my sex life. \n\nI'm going through so much right now, losing 180lbs, new relationship, being disabled. And on top of it my PTSD is so bad. My anxiety is a mess. I've always got chest pains. \n\nMy sex is fucked.\n\nI want to have sex. I enjoy sex with my SO. For the first time I actually want to engage in sexual activity. And it was amazing when we met. \n\nThen I started contraceptives. The stress of having no money got more abd being a disabled single mum and the relationship went to shit because of my baggage and me being a shit girlfriend.\n\nAnd then came the PTSD. During sex.\n\nI was raped right next to where im sat as I type this. So as you can imagine feeling sexy here is hard, we used to have sex in hotels, that was easier.

{"id": "24_ptsd", "displayed_text": "Partner Committed Himself to a Psychiatric Hold and I'm Trying Very Hard \nMy SO has been really distant with everyone he knows lately and it began to worry me and everyone else. I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his \"voice\". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend \"Jay's\" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.\n\nThe next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with \"Jay\". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.\n\nBack when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. \n\n\n\nI knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. \n\n\nEarlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a \"shooting in the woods\" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. \n\nAnd then this happened.\n\nI'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.\n\nI don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know.", "label_annotations": {}, "span_annotations": [{"start": 2158, "end": 2339, "span": "f I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held.
