It's like he's two different people, and no one else really sees that side of him. I was blamed for a lot of our troubles, and now we don't really talk much. I'm worried because he's in a trusted position of leadership and no one suspects anything. They just think I'm attacking his character. How do I know for sure?"

        "text":"How can I advise a friend to consider therapy? I recently came to understand indirectly that my closest friend might be experiencing some symptoms of PTSD for a trauma that might not have seen any resolution. They're a very private person in general and I understand why they would not have wanted to disclose what they did. But their coping mechanisms had gotten pretty disruptive to our friendship, so I found myself asking after what was up and accidentally put them in a position of having to disclose some details to me in order to answer all my questions.\n\nWhile they have never mentioned PTSD specifically, it seems like a strong possibility to me as an outsider. My other best friend has talked with me in depth about his own experiences with PTSD, so perhaps the thought started there in my mind. I don't want to pretend I'm diagnosing her, but I am looking to suggest therapy in general without being insensitive or trigger them by accident.\n\nThey cited extreme dissociation and emotional numbness and specific flashbacks as things interfering with our friendship and their life right now, and while I recognize that I shouldn't and will not come in to their space claiming to know how to do best for them, based on what they mentioned as their plan to deal with this ongoing stress, I am very concerned that they're entirely avoiding the possibility of professional therapy.\n\nEven if they do numb the negative emotions after the next few months of cutting themself off from others for a bit, I'm worried that that could mean there will still be a lack of healthier mechanisms in place.\n\nI definitely don't want to come off to them like I'm digging into their past. This is their fight in the end, but this person is very dear to me. I stated when I first found out that I would be there for them if they needed me, of course, but I know they're not in a place to reach out actively to me. And like I mentioned, they're very private and I've always respected their natural distance. But this flashback-induced isolation felt so different from that that I ended up digging into their privacy way more than usual and accidentally realized it might be partly due to that traumatic event.\n\nI'm not sure how to reopen the discussion briefly just to suggest with the best intentions looking for professional help. I'd love to hear any advice about how to open this discussion or phrase this or even what to avoid saying that would sound too preachy or unhelpful.\n\nI have my own struggle with depression and anxiety that gets in the way of things, but I was really lucky to have my parents' insurance for therapy when I needed it. TMy friend is not necessarily in that same position, and I know that not everyone might be ready to talk to a therapist right away. But I feel like I want to suggest therapy as their best friend who wants simultaneously to give them time and to just make sure they know they deserve help as much as anyone else.\n\nI'm just not sure that advice is solicited in this situation. And if I could give it without overstepping, I'm just also not sure how to do that. I would really appreciate even a short anecdotal tip if anyone has one. And thank you for your time reading this."

        "text":"Just shouting into the void Do you know what it's like for someone to ask about your summer plans, and for your first thought to be, 'I don't even know if I'll be alive by summer.'?\n\nDo you know what it's like for all the noise in the world to boil down to just two voices? And nothing terrifies you more than wondering how long it will take for there to just be one voice left? \n\nEverything in my world, every person, every event, every action, every idea, every desire, can only say one of two things: 'Give up,' or 'Keep trying'. Problem is, it's harder and harder to hear hope. Every decision I make it either to give up or keep trying. Every single one. It's not a decision of whether to go to work or stay home; it's a question of whether I'm giving up today. I never have to decide whether I'm going to do the laundry or not; I have to choose whether to keep trying or not. \n\nOf course, it's not quite that simple, is it? Because every choice has a cost, and that cost is pain. Sometimes trying hurts more. Sometimes giving up hurts more. But it always hurts to know that there's no sense or order to it at all. No matter what I choose, it will hurt. I'll be more tired tomorrow than I was today, it will be more difficult the day after that. So why 'keep trying'? It's a question I have to 'keep trying' to answer, isn't it? Because trying or giving up is not ultimately a question of survival, but of sacrifice. \n\nSuffering is worst when it is meaningless. A man can absorb a universe of pain for a noble purpose, but a prick of senseless suffering can bring him to his knees. At least it's true for me. Perhaps it's an inherent weakness. Perhaps it's a failure of character. Does it matter? I suspect it might have, once, but now that pain has scoured so much of me away I have my doubts. What difference would it make if I was alive or dead? \n\nOf course, the truth is, death would be an immeasurable improvement for me. But in the depths of my soul I know that my life has never been about me. In fact, that barest shred of self-forgetfulness, of selflessness, is the only thing keeping me alive. I wish it was because I was primarily motivated by my care for others, of how devastating my selfish death would be to them, but I suspect it's not. Brutally and truthfully, to deny the reality of my derivative and dependent existence would be to obliterate the last anchor-hold of meaning to life at all. There's little sense in wading through the philosophical underpinnings of the conviction, but there it is all the same. If life is about me, it must be meaningless. If life has never been about me, it is because an objective purpose exists that, by its weight and significance, orients all lives toward itself. \n\nMy pain has banished me into darkness, blinded by suffering to the noonbright hope and meaning that lights my way unseen. But I am not the gravest thing in my universe; hope has far more gravity than I, and my world is trapped in its orbit, however much I stumble and crawl in my blindness. \n\nI wonder if anyone knows how it feels to feel life screaming at you to GIVE UP at every turn. Every voice. Every person. Every interaction. Every hurt. Every pleasure. Every failure. Every season. Give up. \n\nDemons can give voice to things, you know. Quiet, innocuous things take on a beastly aspect. Snarling, sniveling, malicious, monstrous lies, though obvious for their fiendish nature, can be bound up in so much rage and sinew that their roar drowns out their foulness. Familiarity is, after all, just another form of blindness. A man can see a lie for what it is the first time he sees it. 'Give up.' He recoils in disgust at the squirming, grimy thing, and wishes that someone would stamp it out. But if all his world becomes crowded with lies, if they squeeze out of holes in the ground and pile up, growing larger, feeding on pain and fear, until they blot out the son and tower over him with claws and horns, smiling wickedly--well, he must go on about his business. Everyone expects him to, anyway. Perhaps the devils aren't really there. No one else seems to notice them, anyway. But try as he might, he cannot ignore them forever. They fade into the background. They become part of his world, part of the canvas instead of the painting. Nuisances long ignored become companions in time. But the screaming. Oh, the howling of hell that can be heard so loud by the soul of one man yet be silent to all others. The loneliness of it all is enough to drive a person mad. \n\nYou're not supposed to give credit to devils, after all. Focus on the positive, they say. It's not the darkness but the light that will triumph, in the end, so is it not as if the darkness was never there at all? It has no power to drive out or drive back its nemesis; so hope, dear boy! Carry your light and live not in fear of the legions that assail you day and night, but especially the night. \n\nBut they never tell you how naked you are in your dreams. How I wish that angels would visit me instead of demons. Words can't describe what it's like to have nightmares for four years straight. Devils can make you dream about anything they like. Frightful nights once in a long while can only trouble young children. But when demons invade the solace of sleep, it's like your enemy taking up residence in your home. They just wait for you to come home; you can't stay away forever. You can't stay awake forever. There's no refuge from that kind of torment. The more your sleep suffers, the more you need it, the more you suffer. I never expected to understand so well why people kill themselves."

Seeing it operate in-person forces me to realize that it's not just a meme, it's the goddamn truth!

My incident was not as serious as war, somehow I wish I could say that it was. I became suicidal at 13, when I remembered an early childhood event involving a priest when I was very young. I made various attempts to die, but was thwarted In my efforts by consecutive strokes of luck. One example, when I was 17 I tried to do it by drinking a bunch of isopropyl alcohol. Your liver can't beak it down, so I figured it was a sure shot. However, I had already gotten drunk off of JD before I drank it, and that alcohol neutralized the isopropyl. So I lived. \nAnyway, around 19 I got a job working for the state cleaning up highways for peanuts. I liked the work, despite the money, because I was into conservation, and a lot of other hippie philosophy. One of my co-workers captured my heart, and in a not so subtle way I drunkenly confessed my affections at a house party I had for all my co workers. It was bad, I was blacked out by then, but that's as far as it went. I apologized the following morning, but she said not to worry about it. I was mortified regardless, and so I was equally shocked when she asked of I would get an apartment with her the following week. My living situation was deteriorating, as my roommate at the time was using roids, and getting more unstable every day. It would mean I had to commute 45 minutes instead of 5, but I wouldn't be strangled in my sleep. After we started living together, during our transitions to our apartment, things were cool. It was myself, her, her best friend and her friends boyfriend. A little cramped, but it made rent feasible. There's more details but I'll condense the rest, I can't think about it all in depth or I'm going to melt down. Any readers with a respectful curiosity can pm me if they want. I ended up being strung along, gaslit, robbed, and psychologically and emotionally tortured until I confronted her about everything. She admitted through a nasty smirk that she thought it was fun to watch me writhe silently, and that I probably deserved it. Then she surmised that because I was of no further use to her, I would be useless to anyone else. And she told me to finish the job. I broke down, and almost jammed a knife into the nearest light socket. Then I dropped the knife... I couldn't do it. I couldn't leave and hurt my family, but if I'm living for them, is it genuine? Is it really living?\nThat day haunts me still, and I don't have tools that work anymore. Are there any sufferers out there reading that have any tips for someone in my position? I've been having more frequent flashbacks and nightmares about her, and that whole experience. Please help.\n"

When I started working the director, who hired me, was very impress with my work 2 months into it. I was happy and I worked very hard to learn everything as much as I could even though the training was barely existent. My director then left as she had an opportunity elsewhere and things started going downhill. My coworker became extremely lazy with her job so it meant more work for me. My manager also became toxic and would get annoyed with any minor mistake I would make even though I had no proper training. Whenever I am triggered I could easily forget what people tell me the second they either stop talking or say something different. I started to write things down and ask them to slowly explain and I'd repeat what they said to ensure I got it right. They later got annoyed with this. They would say I got it right but complain afterwards that it was done incorrectly. Later their complaints turned into forms of scolding via email, using all caps for certain words. I tried my best for the longest time to not let it get to me, in other words I would suffer on the inside so no one would notice. After awhile I'd approach the new director and explained what was happening and for now I was just making them aware. The issue ofcourse kept on going. I kept getting harassed on a daily basis ended up with panic attacks at work and overall anxiety. My director and HR were the only ones aware of my ptsd and while in their office I broke down and showed them the hostile emails, which my director saw as they were in the email chain. Between the director and hr they put me on short term disability leave for 6 weeks. I had to go back on daily medication and sleeping medication for my night terrors, insomnia, and my depression and anxiety. A week before my return I had almost everything ready until a small mistake had occured(don't want to reveal too much) my hr understood and it was not going to be a problem however there was no communication from my hr to my manager and director. My manager texted me and after I explained my situation the harassment began again, erasing how well I was recovering. I then(normally I would not do this) I sent an email to hr saying I quit and why. My insurance with them ended two days later and the insurance I have through the government keeps screwing up by not removing my expired insurance when they said they would. So now I'm running out of meds and I can't schedule anything with a counselor nor a psychiatrist and I'm spiraling down my depression, anxiety, and complex ptsd.\n\nI'm sorry for the long rant and wording. My symptoms are really bad right now. Any kind words, advice, or internet hugs are welcome! Thank you!"

I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent\/ramble\/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)\n\nI had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. \n\nI've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. \n\nNope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. \n\nAnd then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then \"wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?\" \n\nAnd then the floodgates started to open. \n\n*  \"Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable\"      \n* \"Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.\"      \n* \"I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me. All two of the physical fights I have been in, have been with him when he was in the house and I snapped after he wouldn't leave despite me begging mom to have him leave\"      \n* \"What are the other symptoms of ptsd? (googles) ... disturbed sleep? ...\" (i am a violent sleeper. i dont put sheets on anymore as they 100% always are ripped off as i thrash in my sleep\"     \n* \"and... shouting in your sleep? ......\" (no conscious memory, but apparently every night i shout out things. my mom doesnt mention it much anymore unless it was a bad night, but whenever i share a hotel with someone I wake up to \"why were you shouting \"stop go away stop\" at 3 AM?\")           \n* \"what else cou- nightmares too?\" (never related to trauma in a way i can discern, but have nightmares that wake me up screaming in about 1\/3 sleeps)             \n* \"exaggerated startle response? Does that mean what I think? ... Yes. ... fuck...\" (its not quite as severe anymore but i used to invariably freak out if someone touched me without me seeing it. My dad(never hit me, never abused me, was the chill parent) used to poke me in the car at random, just jokingly. I would flinch and recoil every time. Eventually I got to a point where I would sit pushed against the passenger side door to try and get away from it. He asked me at the time why I flinched and got scared, he never hit me. I didnt know why I did that but I couldnt stop. Now I dont do well with people touching me at random, surprising noises, loud bangs, sirens and fire alarms)   \n\nIt was like I was looking at a connect the dots, and the dots were all in a straight line in numerical order. I got deeply confused. Why hadn't I ever talked to my psychiatrists about this? Why didn't I realize I have flashbacks weekly or more? Why didn't I realize hearing aggressive shouting is very prone to do this, even from strangers in public, or in film\/tv? Why didn't I realize my reaction to the memory or presence of my moms abuser far exceeds what is normal? Why did I not connect my hatred of his face, Heineken, the smell of spilled beer, or his cologne with this? How did I never admit this? Any of this? Why did I always deny I had trauma issues or dodge the question so deftly, all the while completely unconscious of what I was dodging? What the fuck do I do now? \n\nI feel like I wasn't hurt badly enough. I wasn't the direct target of any of his violence until I was an adult. It wasn't sexual or combat related. It didn't ruin my life(depression did that for me) like my friend, who I knew disassociates for hours and wakes up multiple times nightly from the nightmares. I feel guilty for even considering it, but I detect too many characteristics that line up for me to ignore it. I'm making an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I've been seeing psychiatrists for 9 years by now and I've never done this. \n\nMy sense of self and my understanding of my mental health has been destroyed. I feel like I was assembling a jigsaw puzzle of myself, was mostly done, and perhaps 40% of the puzzle just got torn off, mixed up, and the pieces thrown across the floor. I've always felt that if nothing else, I knew what happens to my brain. I thought it has been the same for years now. That there wasn't more to discover, just need to work more therapy and cope better. But there's been a giant red neon sign saying \"THESE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS YOU DOLT\" here the whole time and I've been blind to it. What else could I have missed? How deep does this trauma stuff run? How am I supposed to self evaluate when I can apparently never be objective about these things? What use is talking about ones symptoms if I managed to perfectly lie to myself and to my doctors and therapists for all of these years?\n\nIt's so plainly obvious, I think I must have subconsciously been refusing to accept it. To protect.. something. That's why I think I was able to take off the blinders about this when I was uninhibited through the drugs I took to calm down. Its my only thought I've managed to come up with regarding why I never saw the plainly obvious truth, and instead unconsciously denied and avoided, with expert skill, connecting the symptoms to trauma. Even the flashbacks. I always just thought I was being dramatic and emotional. I never had a thought about them beyond \"oh just ignore it\". Even though I knew what PTSD commonly presents as. Even though I didn't think I was hiding anything or that I would hide anything like this. \n\nI'm talking to my psychiatrist soon. I don't look forward to it at all. I have a feeling it will be awful trying to say any of this. I don't even know what's next. I am not able to reduce my exposure to my triggers. I can't control him. My mom thinks I should like him and has never understood how upset I get. Even when I (of all people, never hurt a fly, never wanted to fight anyone, ever) have been so upset by his presence, combined with hearing his inescapable voice in my bedroom, that I attacked him. Two different times. I can't even type this post without crying from this. Talking. Ugh. :(\n\nSorry for this huge wall of text. I'm just. My brain feels like scrambled eggs. So many questions. Feel so lost about who\/what I am as a person and what my mental illness means and how they affect me. It's seemingly all gone out the window and I'm put back at the start. Need to start working on writing stuff down for my appointment so I can't conveniently forget to mention it. \n"

So when I started working at my dream job at a dog hotel I thought that this was the best job I ever had. Physically, demanding yes, but fun and rewarding. \n\nIt was a month and a half into my new job when I was attacked by a pit bull. The dog was special needs which usually means he was dog aggressive which he was. What this boils down to is that I took him out to play in the morning, and again in the afternoon.  The Pit had seen a dog next door and lost it. I went through protocol to redirect his attention to me so that we could continue to play, but when none of that worked sp I squirted water onto his neck.\n\nAll that agression redirect to me, and he gave me no indication that he was going to attack so it surprised me when he jumped up going straight for my throat. Luckily I reacted and punched him in the face. Here I am moving cars and trash cans using them as buffers between me and the dog until he brings me down, and goes ham on my leg almost to the point of breaking it.\n\nLong story short it's been five months since this event, and my official diagnostic of PTSD. Isn't getting any better even with the help of my therapist. Nightmares always escalate to where the Pit snapped my neck. \n\nI just needed to post this. I was too afraid to put it on my normal social media accounts because the back lash from pit bull sympathizers,  and to me it dosen't matter it was a pit bull it could have been any dog breed. It just makes life hard when even the smallest of dogs prevent me from enjoying life, and when I feel conflicted about my love of dogs especially when I live in a highly populated dog area."

Also, skit to the asterisk to skip several bleak accounts of some bad times and to the point of this post) \n\n To clarify, I am not diagnosed with ptsd and am by no means claiming to have the disorder. I exhibit many of the symptoms I have read about, but obviously that is by no means a diagnosis. I post this here, as reoccurring issues I have really been struggling with fall under the symptoms of ptsd, and ultimately, for lack of a better place to do so. If anyone knows of a more appropriate place I may voice my concerns to, feel free to correct me and I shall be on my way. \n\nRegardless, let me begin. \n\nI am fourteen (turning fifteen this month), and last year around this time I began a relationship. Although beginning deceptively normal, it quickly and suddenly spiralled into a cycle of abuse, crudely disguised as love. It began with my communication with her having to be constant, unfaltering; this was preferable to the threat of her becoming upset and ignoring or guilt tripping me - or really using any emotional manipulation tactic that you can think of. \n\nWithout me really being able to grasp what was happening, I had been fully isolated from my friends and family, and really, the whole world. She had dragged me into a delusional foli\u00e9 a deux, in which I constantly faced the threat of rejection, shame, dread, isolation and a whole selection of other rotten, empty feelings. \n\nIn addition to the emotional abuse, she coerced and manipulated me into engaging in sexual acts with her, despite me outlining specifically that I did not want to do so. \n\nSex became the only way for me to feel as if I was good enough for her, and bore some of the only moments at which she seemed happy and pleased with me. It was exhausting and bestowed on me deep, deep guilt, but if I were to refuse she would emotionally blackmail me and because deeply upset. \n\nShe escalated these sexual encounters to the point of extremity, forcing me to buy condoms when I was on the verge of tears. After these sexual encounters i would often cry, and grow increasingly dislodged from my own body, as it was my only coping mechanism to escape the abuse.  I did everything I could to avoid the same occurrence again; dropping change so we wouldn't have the \u00a32.90 for the condoms, refusing to leave the house if I knew that was her intent, fabricating lies about whatever I had to. \n\nI remember once, after telling her I didn't want to, the look on her face in a moment of brief lucidity which interrupted her brigade of plastic emotion, when she mentioned casually that if she got me to agree, then it would essentially be rape. \n\nThe further our relationship progressed, the more distant from reality I became, the further I grew from my family and the further my timid self retreated inwards, in hiding.\n\nMy travelling to France during the holidays exhibited some of the worst torment I had faced, despite not being in person. Her behaviour was amplified and she still had me almost completely under her illusion, although she was slowly losing her grip.\n\nShe would demand to have the passwords to all of my social media, and dig up conversations from months, years prior to dig up as evidence of cheating and disloyalty, only to ignore me for as long as she deemed appropriate and make me feel as guilty as she knew how to.\n\nWeeks before the end of our relationship, she joined me on a family caravaning holiday, which was, in hindsight, hell on earth. Her unrequited jealousy, especially towards my mother and sister, was uncontrollable and beyond reason, and her iron stare haunted the cosy metal box. I looked into her eyes and saw a deep, burning hatred, and became terrified of her. On a particular evening, when the rain was mercilessly beating down on the drooping tents, I was required to accompany her to the toilets, despite her ignoring me. Upon me attempting to talk to her, she quickly turned the corner and abandoned me at a swift, unforgiving place. I, of course, had no idea where on earth she was (she had a nasty habit of doing this) and in my delirious, desperate, confused state, my brain fabricated these tall, black figures who had taken her, as if to create a reason where it was not provided anything remotely attached to reality. Upon being found by my father, urgently pacing around looking for her, hysterical, she expressed no sympathy or concern, but simply offered an empty, dry sorry. \n\nThere are countless other situations I could site, but I think that these I have documented here serve the purpose of explanation well enough. \n\nIn august of last year is when it hits it peak and when I finally severed my ties with her. A barrage of insults following an exhausting, draining, empty argument was my breaking point, and in my desperation I reached out to my present family and family friends, who pointed out to me the reality of the situation. \n\nUpon reflection, it is clear to me that her actions were a result of her own past trauma, and I hold nothin against her. I have learned that holding anger in your heart does nothing but create more pain and sorrow. I also realise that I was so susceptible to her manipulation, as my mother struggled and is struggling with mental health issues, which lead to her being admitted into hospital for spells of time from when I was about 10-13. I knew she also had mental health issues, and subconsciously i believe I wanted desperately to make her happy because I never could make my mother happy, and felt as if it were my fault. \n\n*****I am posting here as, these events and feelings haunt me daily. They haunt my dreams, replay over and over in my head, bore their way into my skull like parasites, prevent me from ever just sitting alone with my thoughts, keep me disconnected from my feelings, sensations, my passions. I feel as if I am carrying around with me an immense guilt and sorrow. No matter how much I think I've made peace with my feelings, forgiven, and tried to move on, I have always been dragged back into this seemingly inescapable vortex of foggy, unclear, jumpy memories and an indescribable, constant feeling of dread and guilt. \n\nEvery time I see her name, hear mention of her, pass her in a corridor or even think of her, I receive an unpleasant jab of adrenaline, and my heart races uncontrollably. Any smells or objects that remind me of her provide the same painful jolt and can send me spiralling into despair. \n\nI am desperate, alone, but I still have so much life to me and I am scared to lose it. I want to set myself free. \n\n(sorry for any issues with coherency and te length. this seems to have provided a lot of therapeutic value, and that is most likely it's primary function. to expect someone to read this much of something so bleak is unreasonable)\n\nIf somehow, you read this far, thank I thank you greatly for briefly indulging in my troubled thoughts, and I wish you the best. \n\n"

At any given time, over 13 MILLION Americans have PTSD. Meanwhile, over 14,000 military members report sexual assault every year.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 83% of military sexual assaults go unreported, meaning there could be upwards of 82,500 military sexual assaults happening PER YEAR. Since my own military sexual assault in the Marines, 3 months before 9\/11, there have been approximately 1.4 MILLION other victims in the military alone. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of joining and chatting with numerous social media groups formed to support PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors.\n\nThere are thousands in these groups, yet there are millions more suffering on their own. PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.\n\nTo show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.\n\nMy story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.\n\nIn my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.\n\nIn the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain. After years on this journey, I have decided to write a book about my experience.\n\nThis book is currently in pre-order sales and will be for the next 24 hours. The journey offers some parallels to The Alchemist and Forrest Gump, though this journey is true.\n\nYour support would go a long way to ensure this story gets told and the conversation around PTSD really gets started.

(Important for later.)\n***\nSchool closed\u2014online classes only thru the rest of the semester\u2014due to Coronavirus. As of today. (Plan as of yesterday was to come back Apr. 6. Then, shortly after that letter from the University President, the POTUS announced his travel ban and the WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic. Today, the plan to return was cancelled\u2014commencement might still happen, but the semester is gonna be all online.)\n\nThis has hit the performing arts\u2014theatre, dance, music\u2014department(s) disproportionally hard. My head is spinning still. I\u2019m nauseous\u2014still. The dorms were going to remain open (I was going to come back by Apr. 6 for sure), but now, everyone has to return from Spring Break, effectively rushing the campus (which is also horrible for disease control) and clean out our lives. We have until March 23 to get out of the dorms. I\u2019m tearing down my life and packing it into boxes tomorrow.\n\nAnd... This year, I had finally overcome a huge trauma I dealt with years ago, where I had a falling out with some folks I was very close with for a long time. The last time I saw them, I had no idea it would be the last time. That trauma\u2019s at the root of so many things I struggle with. Then, today, as I read that letter and started shaking, crying, screaming... I\u2019m a junior, and that whole swath of seniors\u2014I may never get to see them again. Friends, crushes, what have you... People I loved (love\u2014fuck, it\u2019s happening already), so, so much.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t do it again, I can\u2019t do this again.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll probably be working\/writing thru this for a long time. A lot of other students\u2014the seniors, and performing arts seniors, especially; those affected by COVID-19 personally; and those for whom it\u2019ll be very hard to get home\u2014are being hit harder than I am. \n\nBut I finally found my theatre family this year. This semester started with a serious, serious injury for me, but this week has still been the craziest (sorry, I hate that word, but I can\u2019t think of a better one right now) week of the semester. My heart is breaking. And I feel like I\u2019m back to square one (or at least, it feels like I\u2019ve lost so much progress).\n\n\ud83d\ude1e\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\u2764\ufe0f\n***\n*3\/12\/20*"

It's not the only type of therapy that can help, but it seems to help people in a way that is more natural and realistic. As Cory mentioned, anxiety is something that is part of life, so therapies that indicate we can get rid of it are questionable. Our natural inclination when we have anxiety is to STOP any and all things that may cause it or provoke it. We do this because we think it will help, but it actually doesn't. Anxiety usually has us rehashing the past or rehearsing the future\u00a0while ignoring the present. ACT helps folks who have those kinds of tendencies. Be well..Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"

In our societies, sex does represent the second system of differentiation, completely independent of money; and it behaves as a system of differentiation that is at least as ruthless. The effects of these two systems are strictly equivalent. Like economic liberalism without restraint, and for similar reasons, sexual liberalism produces phenomena of absolute impoverishment. Some people make love every day; others make love five or six times in their lives, or never. Some make love with dozens of women; others with none. This is called the \"law of the market\". In an economic system where firing is prohibited, everyone more or less manages to find his or her place. In a sexual system where adultery is prohibited, everyone more or less manages to find a bedfellow. In a perfectly liberal economic system, some accumulate considerable fortunes; others languish in unemployment and misery. In a perfectly liberal sexual system, some have a varied and exciting erotic life; others are reduced to masturbation and loneliness. Sexual liberalism is the extension of economic liberalism and the ones who were adults in the 1970s wanted it."

I don\u2019t want to get into details too much (it triggers me), but it was a lot of the usual stuff (my father and his side of the family blame my mom and myself for the lack of relationship with them when they\u2019ve never tried to have one at all, I can never do anything right, etc...). This also led to her talking to some people who are pretty important to me and getting them successfully on her side. \n\nNone of this came with any threat of harm, the most she did was grab me (literally) and pull me into a hug. But I have depression, anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, and ocd and just her cornering me sent everything off the walls.

Actually, this was almost ten years ago I received this diagnosis. \n\nAt the time, I was in disbelief and thought the guy was a quack. I've never been in combat, never been in a major accident and never had anything extremely traumatic happen to me. Now like may children of my generation (1980s) I was beaten quite a bit by my dad which I know is messed up, and then I was intensely bullied in childhood for several years. But that's the worst of it. I don't think my childhood was exceptional, just frustrating. \n\nBut after speaking with people close to me, and going through the checklist of symptoms, it was undeniable. So I accepted the diagnosis. Eventually I got a prescription for Wellbutrin and it helped me manage many of my symptoms somewhat for the past decade. \n\nLately I've been going through some stressful external events and a month ago due to lack of sleep + stress I had a bit of a freakout with somebody I've been seeing. While my behavior was forgiven, trust was rattled, and it made me rethink about my old diagnosis. Lately I've taken extremely low doses of Xanax (.25 mg) during stressful moments  take the edge off and it's been helpful. And being able to have stress-free moments is helping me think clearly.\n\nAnd sadly, the only conclusion I can make is that PTSD has robbed my life of friendships and opportunities, and will very likely put me in the grave one day if I don't manage it better. \n\nBut it's frustrating because its (1) incurable and (2) I can't even determine what the f--- gave me PTSD.\n\nI want to conquer this, but the last thing I want is to start adding benzos to wellbutrin to do it. It's just temporary. \n\nI've heard of meditation -- it does not work. Not for me anyway.\n\nFrustrating. Is there anybody else who has this illness but doesn't even know why? \n"

He was abusive emotionally and verbally and I remember mostly just hiding under a desk when I got home and just zoning out or not going home. I was a pretty square kid because I didn't want to be like my brother and got bullied a lot for that and I guess my \"dyke\" vibes or whatever (kids threw rocks at me at school-- kinda biblical).   \n\n\nI put all of these feelings aside for the longest time. And by \"put aisde\" I mean, I didn't deal with them and they caused a lot of problems in my development and relationships. My therapist told me that I have PTSD. I thought other sexual trauma was more responsible but, this was what my therapist always wanted to focus on. That and later my cocaine and alcohol habits when I finally snapped.  \n\n\nNow. My brother only drinks and smokes cigarettes. Lives with my parents and is pretty nice and gets help for his OCD. I do not live with my family. I moved across the country and it proved to pretty much help me to be away from them all. Problem is for me. Right now. Is that my brother has changed. But he teases me for being over sensitive and having a temper with him. He loves to tease me and I get so frustrated that I cry and feel myself since it's the same house wanting to crawl under a desk when he does this.   \n\n\nHow do you tell someone that you recognize that they have changed but, you are unable to forgive them (at least mentally because I know I can never physically forgive him due to my body having a will of its own) and that they can not have that teasing sibling relationship with you because you traumatized me too much. My brother is not a responsible person and is pretty condescending and problematic and we fight constantly....   \n\n\nI don't know what to do but, I am staying here currently until January because I live very far up North (the last town before the next town is a fly in town in the Yukon) and I need to wait for the river to completely freeze to cross it to get home. Wasn't planned. I can feel myself just getting worse. "

Some of the PTSD is r\/t a bad car accident I was in and the other part was childhood trauma (not getting into that now). Just started therapy a few months ago for the first time after really bad depression, dissociation, and day\/nocturnal panic attacks and flashbacks.  \n\nAs the title says, heading back from work and I got pulled over on the highway. Officer said I was speeding. I've been dissociating (nightmares\/lack of sleep\/stress from PTSD) more frequently and have no clue what happened before that time.\n\nAnyways, officer walks up to my passenger side and I started to hyperventilate, shake uncontrollably and cry. So bad that I couldn't even form sentences or pull out my wallet. I have the say, I got lucky with the most understanding cop (not enough to get out of the ticket). Not only did he wait patiently, but he kept asking if he could do anything to help. If he could call anyone, get me an ambulance, do anything, etc. I managed to tell him in the midst of it all that I have PTSD and panic disorder and I was having a panic attack. He kept telling me it was okay and to take my time. \n\nHonestly, I dont know what I would have done had he been a douchebag because I literally could not control myself and I felt like the panic attack would have been way worse than it was. I kept having bad flashbacks while he was back in his car (from the cause of my PTSD) and was still basically hyperventilating when he came back. I felt so stupid the whole time because I couldn't calm myself the f down, but having him say \"it's okay, just breathe,\" was really helpful in the moment. \n\nTook a while to actually start driving again and semi process that but I guess I just felt like I needed to share this to people who might get it? Idk. It's frustrating losing chunks in my day, especially for something like this. I'm still feeling \"off\" even though that was an hour ago. Kinda glad I have a therapy session at 1.

        "text":"Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. \n\nGoing to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. \n\nI was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.\n\nI dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. \n\nI dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.\n\nHonestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.\n\nI feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. \n\nIt's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. \n\nBut still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. \n\nI'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.\n\nI know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. \n\n**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks. I have a therapist appointment on friday, but a recent appointment with my psychiatrist, where he absently dismissed a diagnosis of PTSD as being 'purely academic' has me nervous about bringing it up with my therapist."

Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it \"rape\" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.\n\n\n At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).\n\n\nI hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be \"real raped, choked\" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.\n\n\n2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming \"OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP\" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.\n\n\nOver the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???\n\n\nTL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick \"fetish\". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."

So during therapy I recently got told that I have PTSD and Panic Disorder from my father being abusive to me emotionally and verbally, but also from watching him fight and beat on my mom, brother, and step-mother. \nI\u2019m 24 now and my dad has been trying to fix things between us because I\u2019ve been distant for awhile and he knows I was going to start therapy, so he is going to ask me how it\u2019s going. He has BPD and very narcissistic (he denies these diagnosis\u2019s and refuses to take medication) so he has issues with admitting how bad he was when I was younger and blames others for his actions... If he doesn\u2019t hear from me about the diagnosis he will hear it from someone else. How do I tell the person who caused my PTSD that I have PTSD and they\u2019re the reason why? Please help."

I've always thought I had something along the lines of PTSD, however I used to associate PTSD with being in the military so I thought I didn't have it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try to make this short. Ever since I was a kid I have always been incredibly withdrawn when around people. I was okay around immediate family and very close friends, but when around people I didn't have a deep connection with (which was pretty much everyone except for a select few) I would completely shut down. I remember my stomach would get extremely tight and simultaneously my brain felt like it was being shut off. I couldn't find words so I wouldn't talk. From ages 3-15 I went through school only talking if I was forced to (usually by teachers), which resulted in me never saying a word for 95% of the time. I would try to communicate with others by body language (nodding head, shrugging shoulders, etc), because I was unable to talk to them. Even when I wanted to, immense fear would wash over me and I would clam up even more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hated this about myself but for the majority of my school years I couldn't change even though I desperately wanted to. When freshman year started and I was in a new school, I made it my mission to get over this and talk more. I was able to progress slightly for about a year and a half, but halfway through sophomore year I started becoming severely depressed (which lasted throughout the rest of highschool), and I reverted back into my old self. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was told that I was \"just shy as a kid,\" but I know it was something deeper than that. The thing is I don't know why I acted that way. It was probably something to do with my Dad but I never had a clear cause, and reading about PTSD I always thought it was a defining moment that made someone be diagnosed with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways do this sound like PTSD?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

Sanitary?)\n\nMost of this filling in had to do with a number of disturbing things. From me seeing people in the shadows (not monsters like, living breathing people that radiated malicious intent), I wouldn't sleep, I constantly cried, I started peeing my pants, and a couple more things I think were genuine hallucinations. I even slept walked into my parent's bedroom and asked my mom if killing her would break her love for me (my parents aren't liars by the way, and they never told this story with a light heart).\n\nHowever, I remember one thing. A church, and I remember one person there: P.\n\nP was my brother's best friend at the time. He had a history of coming on to random people but never anything too serious. He would always come around with my brother, my parents filled in a couple gaps including one where I spoiled a movie for him on accident.\n\nP was in this church, and I was in the kitchen. I walked around the table, I saw him, and then my memory cut to a bouncy castle outside, but I can't remember anyone else. He was wearing a red shirt and khaki shorts, it was summer, and I had gone in with a crocodile ZooPals plate to get some grapes while everyone else was still outside.\n\nAbout the time my memory stopped being a worthless POS, he stopped coming around. I later figured out that he tried to come onto my brother, and when my brother declined he started attacking him.\n\nI tried to force myself to remember something about the church, but when I tried to remember past walking up to him in the kitchen, the details got extremely weird, like it was a mixture between what actually happened and a placeholder, like when you write over a deleted image and the recovered image is messed up to an extreme degree. This cause a panic attack the likes of which I hadn't felt before, and I tried to kill myself over it (obviously failed, thank god).\n\nI'm not saying I have PTSD, nor am I asking if I do, it just sounds a lot like PTSD and I didn't know where else to post this.

I stood up and was in shock, she threw her arms up and said \"What are you gonna do, hit me!?\" I grabbed my phone and started to record her for proof. She backed away and hid from the camera. Eventually she started to hit herself, most likely the tics from tourettes. I took the phone out again to record her and she saw me doing this and it triggered her, she took the phone and began attacking me and herself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to get my phone back to call the police but she did a good job keeping me from it, I was yelling and in her face because I was pissed.

She had a flashback of her ex beating her. It's been two weeks and she still thinks I did all of that. I cannot contact her due to being arrested so it'll be a while unfortunately. I've attempted to reach out to her family but no response yet. I'm facing 7-10 years in prison with all the charges the cop\/state put on me.

I felt hurt by what was happening.  I've given her my all and I thought we were in love.  \n\nFor some reason she finally said something that helped me understand that it wasnt me.  It's not that she isnt attracted to me.  It's not that she doesnt love me.  She is dealing with something in her head that she isnt ready to tell me or cant even describe.  \n\nI want to be there for her.  I want to be with her.  How do I be supportive in the best way.  I dont want to suffocate her or make her feel pressured.  Is there a way for us to work through this and get back to where we were?\n\nI may have missed a few details but I'm writing this on the fly, any actual advice is welcome and appreciated."

We were walking on a large piece of machinery when the grating broke and he fell from in front of me 40' to the ground. I ran for help and was first on scene. \n\nI took 2 months off after that and tried to cope on my own for a month which failed miserably but after that I started therapy which started helping. I ran out of money about 2 months in as work safe hadn't started sending me cheques yet so I tried to go back to work. I managed to work a couple of days a week for a few weeks until one day I was asked to do a job at heights. I took one look down the ladder I was supposed to go down and instantly had a panic attack. I went home that day and haven't been back to work since\n\nI've spent the last year working with an occupational therapist to do exposure therapy for the crippling fear of heights I developed and a counselor weekly for all the other horrible things I've been feeling\n\nTomorrow I go back to a work site for the first time since my panic attack and I'm scared. It's not the site of the accident, thankfully I never have to go back there again, but it's the same industry all the same. I'm only going for exposure therapy purposes so I'll be there for 2 hours tomorrow.\n\n I know I'm going to be safe but I also know I'm going to have an increase in all my symptoms. Conquering my fear of heights has been the most challenging experience of my life. Exposing myself to a fear over and over left me raw and filled with anxiety. \n\nI just had a few weeks break over Christmas and I finally feel like I'm managing my symptoms. I'm terrified of the flashbacks, anxiety, anger, irritability and all the other things I know that are going to get bad again until I master this fear as well. I'm scared of the looks my coworkers in this macho industry are going to give me and the gossip about me that's going to happen for being gone so long and for needing to do therapy at the workplace. I know I shouldn't feel this way but I'm deeply embarrassed to be doing exposure therapy at work. \n\nIf you read all of this thank you. I'm scared and just needed to write this.

Long time reader but first time posting things.\n\nI never took counseling until now. In the past I used to work at two nursing home facilities and three restaurants but none of those workplaces never appeal to me, or you know never led me to consider thinking of taking counseling which is what I meant. Until on December 7th, 2017, my first day of orientation I was hired for a job at a nursing home where the backdrop view is phenomenal, it was like a valley along the canal and behind the fenced canal was someone's houses that looked like treehouses. Then there was a black cat and her third batch of kittens. Her first two batch of kittens were eaten by coyotes. \n\nYeah we have a lot of coyotes around here. While coyotes were roaming around the small town, the third batch of kittens were taken to an animal shelter by a homeless woman. And they were taken to a better place the day before Christmas so that way they won't be fated to die by coyotes like the previous batch. I feel like me and the cat have something in common. Maybe she has ptsd - I don't really know. \n\nI don't want to sound evangelical but I feel like God had given me a second chance after I quit from the past nursing home. Well enough about the past job where I used to work.\n\nI got an interview from this job while I was at another hospital which shared the same company. I didn't like the hospital where I was because the interviewer didn't tell me on the phone that he was sick and he wasn't going to show up. That was a red flag. One minute later........a woman called me on the phone and said she is a dietary supervisor from another hospital that shared the same company. \n\nThe next day I was there and was greeted by a young woman. She is the same age as my older sister. And everything went downhill from there when my childhood bully is working there as well. She doesn't even remember who I am. I remember who she is. I yelled at her and I got a warning then I couldn't keep my emotion in check because there this short woman in the kitchen with Napoleon complex who is so manipulative. I didn't want to report her at first because the administrator is always so busy and I was just being considerate but instead I got shafted because I made an emotional outburst and she reported me to him. I told him everything but that was the last strike unfortunately. \n\nWell anyway I got discharged yesterday and I'm just writing this so I could make a progress report and see how much improvement I made because hopefully, in ninety days I could probably return to the hospital if the job is still available. I don't know. I hope so. I really like the job. I really like drawing caricature of my dietary supervisor in funny scenarios. But I guess nothing will ever last forever.  \n\nThe CNAs and the LVNs are really cool and hardworking. The administrator is nice but he has to abide with the law so I don't really blame him for having to discharge me like that. My dietary supervisor hated to see me go but I guess it was her first time being forced into the situation where she had to dismiss someone from the job. "

At any given time, over 13 MILLION Americans have PTSD. Meanwhile, over 14,000 military members report sexual assault every year.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 83% of military sexual assaults go unreported, meaning there could be upwards of 82,500 military sexual assaults happening PER YEAR. Since my own military sexual assault in the Marines, 3 months before 9\/11, there have been approximately 1.4 MILLION other victims in the military alone. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of joining and chatting with numerous social media groups formed to support PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors.\n\nThere are thousands in these groups, yet there are millions more suffering on their own. PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.\n\nTo show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.\n\nMy story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.\n\nIn my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.\n\nIn the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain. After years on this journey, I have decided to write a book about my experience.\n\nThis book is currently in pre-order sales and will be for the next 24 hours. The journey offers some parallels to The Alchemist and Forrest Gump, though this journey is true.\n\nYour support would go a long way to ensure this story gets told and the conversation around PTSD really gets started.

        "text":"Six years mostly stable. Backsliding for no apparent reason. I know it happens. Mostly a vent post. No one needs to fucking read this, the TL;DR is the title. I'm just starting to get this millenial thing where posting it here is mildly more comforting than journaling for inexplicable reasons.\n\nLike I said, 6 years managing life pretty \"normally\" since leaving inpatient care after I had reached a nonfunctional point (PTSD is not my only mental illness). I have been in ongoing therapy and taking my meds. It's been up and down but I've rebuilt a full life that moves forward and remained functional to the degree that institutionalization hasn't been thought of again.\n\nBut then really the last 2.5 years or so something snapped in place and I got my symptoms under control in a way I never had before (therapy, consistent medication, and meditation). I've cut down on panic attacks like I never thought possible and largely eliminated most of my behaviors that scream from across the room \"that dude has anxiety!\". I've been moving past triggers with nothing but a blip in my blood pressure and a few moments of breathing. I've read entire books sitting with my back to an open bay window and completed meals at a leisurely pace in bustling open air restaurants. I've been so fucking proud of myself. I've researched and discussed in therapy and try, in a healthy way, to never let myself forget that I'm never \"cured\" and I understand that. \n\nBut I had started to think about thinking about feeling that I could someday live in daily confidence I was done with relapses. You know.... just kinda live. How people do. [They do, right?]\n\nThen two weeks ago, an accidental touch, fuck, an random ass brush, in the small of my back in a crowded bar launched a full on panic attack (made it to private bathroom to have it out, SO who knows it all was there and drove me home, could have been worse). There have been no life triggers for relapse. This is exactly the kind of trigger I've been handling. But this touch broke a dam somehow. In the last two weeks I've reacted to a host of my classic triggers so noticeably that coworkers and acquaintances and strangers are asking if I'm ok, and circle of friends who know what's wrong are exchanging looks and starting to prepare contingency plans for me in social outings again. It's spiraling so fast and I know part of the reason is that I'm feeding it by panicking about it, but how the fuck do you not do that? \n\nI ended up nonfunctional before not just because of the severity of my issues but because I have a lot of \"daily life\" triggers. I'm in hospitality management, low levels of \"normal\" and friendly touching- without warning, I'm ok with handshakes- are basically constant. If I continue to slip at this pace back to where I was 6 years ago I unquestionably cannot keep my job as is.\n\nI can't even cook this week- one of my biggest things that had been so much more than a hobby and so healing it doesn't even make sense- because standing at the stove in our kitchen means you have your back to a door. [New apartment, we moved in last year and I said the door situation would be fine because it's a door exclusively to our own gated backyard, at the time I was OK enough for that knowledge to override the problem and I thought it was a good idea, immersion therapy wise or some shit.]\n\nLike I said I know this isn't how it works but I'm so mad at myself that there's no *cause* for this. I've felt validated (enough) in the past for back slides after difficult life events and literal triggers like wrapping up legal and practical issues relating to my trauma. But everything is going fucking great lately. It just feels like my brain said \"pushing 3 years feeling safe? Long enough buddy!\" and shut that shit down because I don't deserve it. \n\nI know this can be gotten back under control. Therapy is once a month now, I haven't been back since this started but it's next week. I know it will help. I remember this hopelessness before and I can still remember the difference after letting treatment work. \n\n I just feel like I either failed, or somewhere deep in my subconscious, gave up. I can't help but wonder if I subconsciously shut down whatever autonomic part of me has been constantly keeping vigilance because I want to be the old me again, and wallow in it because getting better is so exhausting, and affects my loved ones daily while me just being locked up lets them fucking live. [The fact that I have this pathetic narcissistic tendency is the other reason I ended up nonfunctional before, I'm aware of it. I leaned in back then and that weakness is always there.]\n\nThat's all. Hope y'all out there are doing better."

I liked feeling kind of rebellious I will admit. I wanted to mess with my brain a little and play around with it. When I started to use it, it relaxed my brain in such away that it began alleviating psychotic symptoms. Nicotine is a mind altering drug and it is not impossible for it to mess with your head. I do not have a clear cut explanation for how it works. Anyway, it slowed and lessened the effects of my psychotic symptoms.\n\nI know that what I am doing is unhealthy. I know that I could be harming the vaping community. For that, I feel terrible. At the same time, is it so wrong to be using it if it helps me more than anything? I am sacrificing having an addiction for my mental health. I believe I'm in a moral grey area because I am harming but also helping myself. Is it so bad for me to self medicate when I have stressed other options?\n\nObviously I am still pursuing therapy and psychiatric help.

We're way fucking post-prime now. Not even China has replacement fertility anymore. The only places on earth with healthy reproductive rates remaining are: India, Africa (crazy high), Middle East, and a bit central and South America. Why is all this happening? Every country that adopts feminism stops reproducing. Because as it turns out, women don't actually want to reproduce. They are selfish by nature, and the only reason they married and had babies before is they were forced to. Middle Easterners know this and they are fighting back as hard as they can, but feminism will take them too soon. Without adequate birth rates, everywhere will start declining and dying a slow death. In the best case scenario, we start replacing ourselves with automation and robots like the movie AI. In a worst case scenario, economies just spiral into debt and insolvency. No one is going to fix that problem. No one can. Just like no one is going to fix the problem of inceldom. Fundamentally both come from the same place. Female choice. Feminism. It turns out that when you give women choices, they will choose to take care of themselves and no one else.

I was left in the car with our kids (3 and 9). My ex had crawled out and I turned round and was blindly feeling and calling for our kids. To cut a long story short it was an absolute miracle that any of us, never mind all of us survived.\n\nI have since been such a nervous passenger but have done almost all of the required hours to help our kids through learning to drive.

This is without a doubt one of the biggest downfalls of this forum.  The overall racism has to be stopped, people need to realize the only reason Indians shit on the streets is not because of degeneracy but because we're a poor country that was colonized by the British.  We label things we're not familiar with and repulsed by degeneracy, this shouldn't go on.  There has to be a good reason: If you don't have toilets you have to shit on the streets.  Also I know the general racism is based on looks and how indians looks and this has been going around incel circles for a long time and this needs to be stopped; we can't just glorify the rules of western society while not being part of it.

I've been abused in almost every way you can imagine by parents, foster parents, siblings, significant others, and peers.\n\nMy biggest issue right now is my physical symptoms.

I work hard, but the stress of the job always eats away at me... physically. I get sick. VERY SICK. It all starts with headaches, then my body gets heavy, I catch fever and cough, headaches become migraines, then I'm throwing up and unable to move. It lasts for weeks, sonetimes months. My brain will be foggy. I'll forget what I'm saying as I say it. I forget important things. I forget to eat.\n\nEven as I write this now, I'm sick. I've been \"sick\" for over a month.

It ended up in him saying that he does not want to deal with me anymore, that I have a part of me that is absolute trash and that he is done trying and does not want to contact me anymore and just wants to find someone else to love to repair what I broke. That crushed me.\n\nSo I went no contact for 2 weeks now, even though it is very hard because I have so much anxiety about people leaving me. And have send him a loving message stating that I still want to try my absolute best to improve to get him back, even though I already told him when he broke up but he wasn\u2019t interested then. But who knows... right? \n\nSince I have send the message today and he did not respond but saw it anyway, I started scrolling through old convo\u2019s. And I can\u2019t believe... what a monster I actually became. I threatened with suicide or shared suicidal thoughts when having extreme anxiety attacks. Putting him on trail: \u2018If you do this, I\u2019m going to die.\u2019 And even though I actually felt like that in the moment, reading all of it back makes me feel like a ansolute failure. I have hurt the person who I loved the most time and time again because I was so filled with anger and pain and I could not cope. So in stressful situations, I turned into a manipulative version of myself. \n\nMy first boyfriend was very emotionally abusive and used the same tactics. He completely isolated me, told me I was the most amazing person ever, then proceeded to tell how what an absolute crazy bitch I was who deserved all the bad karma in the world, talked me up about how he loved my red hair, then blocked me everywhere one day without answers and proceeded to date my then BFF (who colored her hair red which was weird and funny). That relationship left me with many scars and I started drinking because of it, as well as trying to find love in the wrong places. But I thought that after some years, I escaped the trauma.\n\nI recognize today that I never did and could not cope with my emotions which made me have extreme anxiety attacks, anger issues, no impulse control, manipulative behaviour to get what I wanted... Also towards my parents. I would say towards the people who support me most and were closest to me.\n\nI turned into the monster that I had despised so many years. How can I ever make up to my now ex BF? How can I try to repair the relationship and gain back his trust? But most importantly, how can I grow as a person from this and make sure I NEVER EVER EVER use that behaviour as a coping mechanism?\n\nI acknowledge that I am just very anger and sad towards the world and this makes me lash out the way I do, but it made me lose the one guy I truly loved. So how on earth can I actively work on myself, love myself and stop myself from doing what I did?"

A little insight in to my more manic\/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days\/week in the hospital she couldn\u2019t stand with out pain.\nFor the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I\u2019d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn\u2019t go in I\u2019d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn\u2019t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.\nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a\/b cup back up to a d\/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time\n\nIv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can\u2019t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don\u2019t really talk in therapy session and the reply\u2019s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school\n\nThere\u2019s an emotion I feel when I\u2019m in a state sometimes, it\u2019s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it\u2019s like there\u2019s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there\u2019s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I\u2019m experiencing and I\u2019m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can\u2019t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.\n  |\n^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^\n\nNo one ever told me what ptsd really entails, if you cold give me a little insight, it would be appreciated.  x\n"

        "text":"New to Reddit and this diagnosis \/\/ I have questions *Hello, before i start this weird post that i'm pretty sure nobody will end up reading let me get a couple things situated. Hi, i'm Uncomfy and i'm new to Reddit. I made this account because specific people in my life say that i have too many issues and i'm uncomfortable to be around. So i made this account specifically for asking questions about things that relate to mental health, and occasionally things i like to indulge in to keep myself preoccupied from the outside world. Hopefully this will cause my issue of being an uncomfortable person.Before i start i must specify that i am not making anything i say up or am doing this for attention. I have no idea how Reddit works, so i apologize if i don't do things that people may find mandatory. (I would appreciate They\/them pronouns if you end up responding to this post please.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TW\/\/ Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest\/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family\/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I skipped A LOT of other issues\/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account\/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of your night\/morning and have a wonderful week. &lt;3"

I have already given in to bad temptations by hooking up with random strangers on social media sites and having oral sex with them. Luckily, they were nice guys, but none of them wanted a relationship with me. I feel dirty by doing this, but I feel pressured to do this things in order to seem normal.\r\n\r\nMost people are surprised when they find out that I am a virgin or never had a boyfriend because people think I am really good looking.

Trigger warning for sexual assault here!\n\nI experienced CSA growing up and have only begun to unpack it now in my 20s so it has been pretty distressful for me. I am still dealing with it pretty hard, but usually, I can get a handle on it. Today I was triggered by a movie I was watching and I ended up having a full-blown episode where I had a meltdown and felt like I had to go out to some random bar or dangerous neighborhood and willingly seek out and put myself into another \"sexual assult-y\" situation in order to cope with my overwhelming feelings. This has happened to me many times before so I knew I needed to just stay put and let the feelings pass. I did and eventually, the unbearable urge to put myself at risk went away.\n\nBut then I felt so much shame, so so so much shame. I was so shocked at my reaction it's like something came over me to try to seek out such a dangerous situation (I guess my mind is trying to make me act out the trauma again). I also figure I had to stay put in bad sexual situations as a child so my brain thinks I need to do that to survive now as an adult. I'm trying to practice self-kindness and talk about the original traumatic events in therapy, but it still is so overwhelming to go through.\n\nI just want to know if anyone has had experiences like this and if you could give any words of encouragement as I try to simmer down from this distressing day? Thank you for reading!"

I have had various hospital appointments over the course of my life (now in my mid-twenties) as well as tests and a second surgery several years ago. I will require more of all of these in the future. Since I was a child I have had severe reactions when going to the hospital or even thinking about my condition and I would break down in tears as a child during appointments. I hate being touched and having to undress during appointments, I feel like I am being violated. My brain and body react to the doctors and nurses as if they were going to hurt me, I am physically and mentally terrified of even going near them and I am completely unable to consciously override this reaction. I cannot stand sounds, sights and smells that remind me of anything to do with my condition, and I will actively go out of my way to avoid them.    \n\n I have flashbacks where I involuntarily replay experiences in the hospital and similar nightmares several times per week. I've also had issues with malpractice, administrative errors and one doctor being almost emotionally abusive, deliberately exaggerating the severity of her condition so they could exercise power and authority over me as a terrified child. I've been diagnosed with a number of mental health conditions after short consultations with a GP - depression, anxiety, insomnia, health anxiety, social anxiety, but since becoming aware of the symptoms of ptsd and briefly seeing a therapist last year, it has become clear to me that undiagnosed ptsd is likely at the root of my problems.    \n\nI feel like I am constantly in fight or flight mode, I can't calm down, slow down my breathing or untense my muscles because I have so much adrenaline flowing through my body all the time. I also think I'm seeing physical symptoms from being in this state for so much of my life - tiredness, poor concentration, autoimmune disorders, etc. I',m currently contacting therapists with experience working with ptsd to see if I can finally start to get a handle on this. For a long time I've struggled with feeling like my symptoms weren't legitimate, being told by doctors and my parents that I was just making it up for attention, I was a clever girl and I needed to stop messing around, that nothing was really wrong etc, all while my trust in people continues to get worse and I use substances to try and temper down my mental and physical reactions. I think by posting my story here I just want some sort of validation that my ptsd is real and valid, that I deserve help and treatment. I would really appreciate a conversation with anybody with medical ptsd, or anyone that can relate in general, feel free to DM me! Thank you for reading this small essay, it really means a lot to me."

I got a new therapist in early 2016 who eventually diagnosed me with PTSD and recommended twice weekly sessions.\n\nI found myself feeling worse than I ever had before (my main trigger, unfortunately, is extremely commonplace and something most people enjoy). \n\nHOWEVER- my GP prescribed me prozac for a totally unrelated health issue (PMDD- essentially being an emotional wreck for a week before each menstrual cycle).\n\nAfter being on the prozac for a few months it has made such an incredible difference in my life, my coping, and my ability to navigate the world when I'm \"triggered\".  I don't feel dulled, don't have any side effects other than reduced appetite, and generally feel so much more capable and in control. My panic response has greatly reduced (though not completely disappeared, naturally) and I find myself less reactive and miserable when I'm forced to face issues and situations that previously caused me a great deal of anguish and anxiety.\n\nI've heard plenty of negative stories, so clearly this medication isn't for everyone, but I thought I'd post about my positive experience just in case anyone is weighing their options.\n\n\n**edited to add that I'm still doing the therapy :)"

(more in post) I'll try to keep this short and simple as possible. But my father had a seizure about 2 and a half weeks ago. I was not there in the same room when it happened, but I knew SOMETHING was wrong when i heard the ictal cry (Google if you are not aware of what this is, but it's pretty much a loud groan, all of the air escaping through the larynx as the seizure starts. I heard the ictal cry and turned the corner and saw my father, stiff, falling to the ground from a standing position, and watched him hit his head, as he was already half of the way down when I saw him.   \n\n\nIt was only me, my sister, and father home at the time. I of course helped him in the moment during the seizure, keeping him on his side, calling 911, etc. He is doing alright now (this was his first tonic seizure, not a diagnosed epileptic as of yet) But, weeks after, i cannot stop thinking about this, especially late at night.   \n\n\ni get up and our of my room every time i hear ANYTHING loud from in the house, since it is typically only me and my father home, while my mother works. I am CONSTANTLY checking up on him, worried that i will walk into another seizure in the moment. I have a grave feeling in my stomach every time i leave my room to check on him.   \n\n\nAlso, a days ago, I woke up and strictly remember having a dream about the seizure experience, like a replay of that day. And that day, i have never been so sad\/angry (i think i suppressed my sadness and ended up getting very irate) which is super abnormal for me. Punching my desk getting mad at games when I never do. Getting mad at friends for saying silly things (I attacked my friend for buying another iphone and supporting apple)   \n\n\nI don't have a license, and I have to get one now, since my father cannot drive for 6 months. This is giving me a ton of anxiety, especially since I am being forced in a way.   \n\n\nI'm sorry if this is such a dumb question, but is this ptsd of some sort? I somewhat have talked to me mother about this, and she realizes that it has affected me badly, but i dont know if she knows how bad. I haven't been working, and she has been giving me a bud here and there (marijuana) to help me sleep.   \n\n\ni am sorry if I am very all over the place.  But is this just, general sadness and time will heal things. Or is this something that I need to talk to someone about, and perhaps find a way to seek help. (money is tight)"

When I was 10 I was beaten every day by my parents and people who your supposed to trust I remember all of them every second of each punch, kick and being thrown. When I was 13 I was walking at home from school and I saw someone on there knees begging for change. So I gave them my left over lunch money 5.73$ I counted it out before I gave it to them. When I walked away I looked back at the man to see someone else standing above him with a gun. The guy sitting offered what I gave him to the man but I heard him say it wasn't enough. I watched as the man with the gun pulled the trigger and the guy sitting fell limp to the ground. The man ran away and I sat down were I was and just looked even when the sitting man was taken away.

I used the term \"My woman\" because I didn't want him to know her name.\nI hope the post works this time.\nI hope that some of you can relate and that it brings a bit of hope, among all the anger that infects us.\n\nDear Tom\nIt's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.\n\nI wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.\n\nPeace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that.\n\nI also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask \"how's school?\", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than \"good\" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.\n\nSo you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9\/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be \"normal\", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be \"normal\" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what \"normal\" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness.\n\nThe affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger.\n\nI have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.\n\nMy anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say \"What's wrong with you?\". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.\n\nMy depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.\n\nSince my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come.\n\nI'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well.\n\nYou have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect.\n\nYou used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line \"you're destroying this family\" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted.\n\nBut now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said \"you're destroying the family\"; what you meant was something different. \"Family\" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, \"Family\" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was \"you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear\" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me.\n\nYou'd also say \"I put a roof over your head\". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. \"I did my job, so now you owe me\". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the \"family\".\n\nYou aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.\n\nI could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle. As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The \"zig-zag\" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom.\n\nWords can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that \"my kid is dying\" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.\n\nYou might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your \"gifts\". The toys were a way of saying \"sorry I bashed your head the other day\", or maybe \"please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute\". The car was a way of saying \"please disappear\". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was \"destroying the family\" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a \"bad investment\" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple \"grudge\" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your \"gifts\".\n\nSometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. \"Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years\", \"nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?\", \"nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?\", \"nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?\". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in \"raising\" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and \"destroy the family\".\n\nAnother inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day.\n\nI tried to explain what it was like to be \"raised\" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.\n\nMoving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.\n\nI'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.\n\nOn days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me.\n\nI think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now.\n\nIt's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.\n\nThis letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to \"destroy the family\"."

        "text":"PTSD from another\u2019s experience Trigger warning for sexual content, BDSM, similarities with pedophilia, mention of parental abuse, mention of suicide\n\nTo give a little background, I (23F) was abused my by dad for the first 6 years of my life, physically and verbally. A family member mentioned something about possible sexual abuse, but this topic is very avoided by our family, so it\u2019s never discussed. \n\nMy older brother (29) was seriously affected by the abuse he endured, and now has his own set of struggles and problems he faces as an adult. This includes uncontrollable anger, violence to his girlfriend, screaming, throwing things (anything from a mug to a dinner chair) around when things don\u2019t go his way, threatening suicide, and more. I lived with him and my mom for a few years like this and this caused me to be very sensitive to noise, particularly made by men. I don\u2019t live with them anymore. I have been afraid and wary of men for my whole life, and part of me wants to keep it that way for my safety even though I know it causes me a lot of pain in my every day of life.\n\nWithout getting too into details, my long distance girlfriend (22) visited a BDSM dungeon to learn what it was about and instantly had a 70 year old man infatuated with her. He invited her to his house to teach her, and I strongly discouraged her from going. After an impact play session at the dungeon and some time, she asked me if she could go to his house for more sessions because he wanted it so badly. We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. \n\nThis man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn\u2019t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He\u2019d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.\n\nOne of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend\u2019s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. \n\nHe continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me. I already had an extreme aversion to the idea of sex with men, especially old men, and I couldn\u2019t handle that. I messaged my girlfriend that night that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch any more of their sessions.\n\nSome time passed, she had one or two more sessions with him (I tried to think about it as little as possible while it was going on so I wasn\u2019t keeping count), and my girlfriend moved for school in early fall. After a while, I believed that he was in the past and wouldn\u2019t be a problem again. Eventually, my girlfriend and I discussed this and she realized how creepy this situation actually was, and she felt extremely uncomfortable with how familiar this old man was with her body. We agreed that we shouldn\u2019t have contact with him anymore and she told him this politely in a text. We tried to move on together and leave this in the past.\n\nAnd then he posted photos of her body on a BDSM website without her consent. She asked him to take it down, he refused. After a whole night of pleading him to take it down, we reported it and it disappeared. A couple days later, he posted it again. She got in contact with the dungeon she met him at, which he was actually longterm volunteer for, and they were able to get the photo down and promised my girlfriend they\u2019d keep an eye on his profile and that they\u2019d deal with his situation with the dungeon.\n\nTLDR: Creepy 70 year old man consistently pushes my girlfriend\u2019s and my boundaries during BDSM impact play session and then posts photos of my gf\u2019s body in retaliation of my gf telling him she doesn\u2019t want him in her life anymore.\n\nNow I have an extreme on-sight reaction to any old man even slightly similar to this man. I feel like I\u2019m going to collapse and cry and freak out the second I visually process an old man. The biggest problem is that I work at a drugstore and there are LOTS of old men who use the store. I\u2019m terrified of them and I don\u2019t know how long I can handle these extreme responses I have to seeing them. Nearly of my trauma related reactions have funneled into this and it\u2019s more extreme than anything I\u2019ve experienced before.\n\nThankfully, I will be started EMDR therapy soon, and I really really hope to see improvement one day. I think I might need to quit my job. I feel like I\u2019m going to die when I have to ring up an old man, I can barely speak to them and I can\u2019t look them in the eyes. I\u2019ve cried throughout typing this and I am so scared about going back to work every single day.\n\nDoes it make sense that my triggers and reactions changed so much just by this situation I didn\u2019t even experience firsthand?"

At the start of freshman year, we dated for about a week before his parents ended it because they said he is too young to date. He has been dating a really sweet senior girl for a month or two. I have nothing against her except for the fact that she has Tim's heart. He is convinced that they are in love, and maybe they are, but I don't really believe him. \r\n\r\nLately, Tim had been expressing concern about what is going to happen when Sally leaves for college at the end of term this year. He's been asking me to help him with Sally and what girls like to show her how much he loves her. But he's also been thinking about breaking up with her just so they won't have to deal with it when she leaves. He seems really torn up about it, and I want to know what to say to him and how to help him once she leaves. \r\n\r\nHe knows that I still crush on him. He doesn't rub it in my face. He's a good guy, but I want to actually help him out and recover before we think about maybe another relationship between us. How do I do that when the time comes? How do I support him and show him that I'm here without wanting to hook up? How do I make him feel better? He is convinced he's never going to be able to love anyone ever again, which I think is ridiculous."

I was 15 when it started. I continued a relationship with him for the next 4 years. When we moved in together he became increasingly abusive and he raped me. After that he started stalking me and harassing me endlessly, so I reported it. All of it. I didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t want to even think about it anymore. But I just wanted him to leave me alone. Since then I\u2019ve had to make my statement 3 different times, and they need me to do it again. I was venting to my best friend about how I didn\u2019t think I could handle doing it again and she told me that the only way I\u2019ll ever be at peace with it is if I just keep reliving it until I get over it, and compared it to when she had to watch her dog die. I told her there was no being at peace with being raped by someone who you loved and she said \u201cwell I guess you can just let it torment you forever then\u201d. I\u2019m really hurt to hear this coming from her of all people. I\u2019ve been struggling to find any sort of support from anyone and I\u2019ve been struggling to cope in general.

I got out, and immediately jumped into a relationship with someone who was coercive and controlling. I\u2019ve been single ever since, and have only recently (after getting the go-ahead from my therapist) started dating around again. \n\nMy mom, who knows all of the above, somehow keeps tabs on my abuser. I guess her step-sister\u2019s mom is friends with my abuser\u2019s family, and... something? Idk. I just know that I\u2019ve REPEATEDLY asked that she stops giving me updates on his life. I don\u2019t want to hear it. It\u2019s weird. He literally tried to kill me, I don\u2019t get her obsession with him. But anyway. \n\nLast night, at about 10:30, I was peacefully sleeping when she calls me. And again. And again. I have my phone on silent, but my Fitbit also vibrates when I get calls. I finally answer, and she switches it to FaceTime. It isn\u2019t an emergency, she just wanted to tell me my abuser is going to be a dad in a few weeks. I tell her \u201csucks for them. That poor child.\u201d and go to end the call. \n\nShe calls BACK, and asks why I won\u2019t date, what did she do so wrong, why won\u2019t I give her grandchildren.... \n\nI tell her, as nicely as I can \u201cI\u2019ve told you to stop giving me updates on him. Now fuck off.\u201d Took off my Fitbit, turned off my phone, and failed to fall asleep for the rest of the night. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe, I\u2019m hyper vigilant, and just overall ruined my night. \n\nWhen I finally got up this morning, I had a barrage of texts telling me that she\u2019s just worried I won\u2019t give her grand babies, she gave me a great childhood, and she can\u2019t understand why I won\u2019t date.

I\u2019m so fucking done with this bullshit. I get it, I\u2019m 25, so \u201cmy time is running out to marry well,\u201d and yeah. Maybe I am unlovable. I feel like I\u2019m just damaged goods, and can never be loved. I feel like there\u2019s just too much bad to overcome the good, like I\u2019m faking my way through life and don\u2019t deserve the good things that have happened since leaving my abuser.

Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.\n*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)\n*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we \"misbehaved\" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit\/ locked in closets\/ stepped on.\n*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. \n*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep\/ high\/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. \n*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. \n*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.\n*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.\n*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. \n*I was in a \"relationship\" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).\n*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. \n\nAll of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.\n\nI want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old.

I just want to acknowkedge that life just really fucking sucks sometimes. And it's tough. And exhausting. And frustrating. And full of chaos and unfairness.\n\nI've had a difficult life. Not as difficult as some but just a lot of bad unfair things happening to me and me not deserving any of it.\n\nI've been burned (when I was 3), emotionally abused by my mom, hit by three cars (all from distracted drivers...i was actually stopped in the 2 recent ones and people just hit me...causing concussions and disc bulge and severe whiplash), abused in a toxic relationship, dealt with depression, self harm, anxiety, and had a pulmonary embolism because of birth control. I'm 34. What else is life going to throw at me??\n\nI mean wtf?? I'm so tired of getting knocked back. I've had psychological issues and possible PTSD from the trauma of getting burned as a kid...and my mom never addressed it. She kept saying that something was wrong with me and I needed to get fixed (that I was broken). Well...duh! I suffered trauma at a young age. Then because of her emotional neglect and abuse I've spent the majority of my adult life working on my self worth and going through therapy.\n\nWhen I think life is good...I get hit by a car head on in 2016. I now have chronic pain. It was so hard dealing with all that pain and the hopelessness and depression and PTSD. But I got through it. I started to heal. Then I got a pulmonary embolism in 2017. If the outside world wasn't safe...surely my own body is safe? Wrong.\n\nNow I had PTSD related to body sensations. Being on blood thinners for 8 months was horrible. I felt sick and weak and scared all the time. But I got through it. I went to therapy. I processed. Then again life was seeming okay. I was healing and getting more safe.\n\nThen I get hit by another car. Rear ended while stopped behind a bus and pushed into a pole on the side walk. This was June 2019. I've had vertigo and neck pain. My poor brain and body can't take any more of this trauma. My emotions can't. It's hard to drive. I get scared at any fast car around me thinking how easy it is for one of them to not pay attention and then kill me. Maybe the next one will kill me because life seems to want to do that.\n\nI'm just really tired. What'll I do? Just keep existing until something else traumatic comes along.\n\nMy relationship with my bf may also be ending. Not in anger or drama...in sadness that sometimes it just doesn't work out. That love isn't enough when two people have opposing needs or values. We love each other but that doesn't mean it'll work.\n\nI wish I just had an okay life. That I grew up in a supportive household and that I don't know what it's like for an 800 pound object to be speeding towards me, completely helpless in every way. \n\nThere's no control in life. Only trying and hoping something bad doesn't happen. But it does. It always does."

For the first time I fully accepted it and finally believed myself that I didn't made it up as an excuse to my other disorders.\n\nShe got really happy and also did I, it was so wonderful to not doubt myself anymore, it was reliefing and she said that this was the biggest breakthrough we've done so far and that now things will get easier and better, I just wanted to share with all of you, it gets better, take care \u2764\ufe0f.\n\nI'm sorry if I have misspelled something, English isn't my first language."

Any comment from you guys will be very appreciated! \n\nSo I recently broke up with my girlfriend over a big fight. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had a fight like this and every-time we get into an argument she tends to get very defensive and start attacking me. She gets into this rage of cursing me out loud regardless of where we are or who we are with and goes on for 30 minutes. In the beginning of the relationship, I thought this to be more nothing more than anger management and her personality. She tends to be very aggressive with her words and starts attacking the other person when she feels like she gets taken advantage of. There are a few restaurants that Im still ashamed to go because my ex and I caused a very unpleasant scene. I mean everyone gets like that when they get mad but it was way too extreme. She had so much hatred and negativity against certain type of people and would even mention of hurting the others at extreme.\n\nAfter the breakup, I had some time to catch up with a friend. We were just having a couple of drinks just chatting and the word \u201cPTSD\u201d was brought up. And this word instantly hit me so hard... I mean folks I never experienced it and never thought I would meet anyone who had it. But deep inside me I knew my ex was going through PTSD. \n\nOne of the symptoms she had was nightmare. She never shared her nightmare with me except for once and I never insisted on her telling me since it always put her in a bad mood. But that time she told me, it\u2019s someone trying to attack her and she cant seem to do anything about it..... The other physical symptoms she had (at least thats what I think) were her migraines. She was very sensitive to noises. She would scream in th middle of the night and scared the shit out of me. She also would jerk her leg at night saying it hurts and would not be able to go to sleep. She told me she has a bad memory. All of this indicate that she has PTSD but I was oblivious to the symptoms.  Now that I have learned this, I only have regrets of not being more understanding and guiding her in th right direction. Although I have to admit that I was very exhausted from this relationship I cant deny the fact that I still love her and care for her.    Im willing to put myself in her shoes even if that means I take away just a little of the pain she goes through.\n\nFolks, I would love to hear some of you guys go through. Obviously talking about symptoms is not pleasant but if anyone is willing to share what they have to go through it will be much appreciated.\n\nThanks"

At first, I was by his side - going to appointments, visiting him at home or the hospital. Just making sure he was okay. \n\nThe first month or so, he was in and out of the hospital. One of his visits to the ER had my sister calling to see if I could come take over for her. Her toddler was fussing and she had been with dad all day. I said yeah of course, but when I got to the hospital, I ended up having a massive panic attack. My daughter was with me and it made the panic worse because I was worried about her seeing me lose control. I called my sister and said I couldn't make it. I wasn't feeling well and to see if our Uncle was available. My daughter and I had to be driven home because I couldn't safely get behind the wheel.\n\nSince that incident... I haven't seen or really spoken with my dad. I feel like absolute crap because of it.\n\nTo put things into context, I was diagnosed with PTSD in the spring of 2017 after my mom died in a head-on collision. My dad has been absent from my life since about the age of 13 (I'm 35 now). When he was in my life - he was less than great. I didn't realize this until speaking about my childhood with other people that pointed out that he seemed like a selfish asshole. I was a kid... I didn't know any better. It seemed normal to me.   \n\nA lot of my PTSD seems to be seeded in guilt and what I should be doing. I've gotten used to my dad not being in my life, but he is dying and alone. He is the only parent I have left. However, I don't want to experience the death of a parent all over again. I don't think I could mentally handle it. I still haven't come to terms with my mom's death. I deal with insomnia, suicidal thoughts, major depression, and have not worked in over 2 years. \n\nAm I shit daughter? \n\nI know he is going to die, but I came to terms with him not being in my life a long time ago or so I thought...

No one in my family knows about what I\u2019ve been through\u2014my mom is actually still married to the man who abused me. I have told my current boyfriend about it as well as a few friends over the years but it has always been a secret. \n\nI perseverate on it daily and it has had an effect on every aspect of my life. I\u2019m happy I\u2019m making progress in addressing it in therapy and working on healing.\n\nHowever, I want to tell my brother and maybe my sister about it more than anything.

Just a yell very close to my face when I turned around, and I flat out smacked him.\n\nWe got into some heated banter and I took more meds (accidentally 1 over the daily max..I'm okay I think?) And a manager came out of course. I explained all of this, and manager did not previously know of my condition or any others. He seemed understanding, but I've seen fake understanding too much so I don't know. I was already waiting to go home so I clocked out.\n\nI smacked my head against my car window a bit, it's been quite some time since I've self harmed like that.

He has ptsd and agoraphobia, mostly untreated for the majority of our time together. I finally convinced him to get some counseling maybe 6 months ago, and now he talks to a nice woman in the phone once a week, who seems helpful, and he has made some great strides recently in getting out more.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a large pile of issues between the agoraphobia and the ptsd, but what I\u2019m curious about today is the personality shift that tends to happen when he gets triggered and depersonalizes\/derealizes. It starts with visible agitation and anxiety, which quickly progresses to becoming argumentative and aggressive and eventually be completely unable to listen to logic or follow any train of thought, mine or his. I spent years trying to talk things over or find any way to pacify him in those moments, but I generally found that once I realized what was happening, he was too far gone and too far into victim mode, and any words that came out of my mouth would just end up getting twisted and make things worse. \n\nOf course, one of his big triggers is abandonment issues, so as soon as I start to realize that he\u2019s in that place and try to extricate myself from the situation, it tends to escalate things. My latest \u201csolution\u201d has been to just freeze and go comatose while he rages at me and calls me an asshole for ignoring his pain, and wait for him to get some sleep. It almost always happens late at night when he\u2019s overtired, and the only reset button tends to be sleep. Yes, sometimes this is made worse by alcohol but it\u2019s also been known to happen when he\u2019s dead sober. When he wakes up in the morning he can usually barely remember what has happened, is absolutely horrified at the way he\u2019s made me feel, and completely wracked with guilt. I\u2019m always incredibly upset and angry the next day, when it feels safe to do so, but it generally fades throughout the day as it feels useless to be angry at someone who isn\u2019t there anymore and who is punishing himself far more than I could.\n\nHe is the biggest, sweetest puppy dog, the type of guy who will spend a few minutes investigating each log before putting it into the fire to make sure no bugs will be burnt alive. Animals love him. I have never met someone more kind, more attuned to my needs and understanding of my feelings. He has the most healing hands, he can take away the most debilitating pain with a simple head massage (I get the type of menstrual cramps that leave me screaming and throwing up on the bathroom floor).\n\nAnd yet - every now and then he leaves and in his place there is a man who is my nightmare. I know that at this point I have my own trauma to deal with from these nights. He\u2019s never hurt me and I\u2019m generally not physically frightened, but he has punched a few holes in the wall and there have been bad nights where he uses his size (we have a 14-inch, 100-lb difference) to try and stop me from leaving his house, towering over me and getting obvious pleasure from intimidating me, physically holding my car door closed so I cannot leave, or getting into my car with me and refusing to get out.\n\nI feel stupid as I write this, I feel like every stereotype of a girl blinded by love. \n\nMaybe I just needed to vent, or see this all written out. But I am still so curious about how, if possible, I can derail nights like these. He claims that all he needs is hugs. Sometimes I\u2019m able to push past all of my feelings of wanting to stay away and try to squeeze the bad out of him. Sometimes it works for a second, but it\u2019s never long before he turns on me again and accuses me of god knows what. It\u2019s so hard to keep track of reality and not get pulled down the rabbit hole of incoherent thought on nights like that. \n\nHas anyone out there experienced issues like this, on either end, and found anything in the moment that\u2019s been able to snap them out of it? It happened a couple nights ago and it was the first time I\u2019ve encountered that side of him in many months, so I have hope that therapy is working and that things are on the upswing. But in the meantime, I\u2019d be so grateful for any insight into anything helpful someone in my position can do. I saw a therapist for a while but she mostly just wanted to talk about my personal issues (I\u2019ve been battling chronic depression for most of my life) and never seemed to want to touch much on the subject of how to help the person who affects my life the most.\n\nSorry this is such a rant, and thanks to anyone who managed to read this far."

        "text":"What if my hurt and issues (disorganised attachment) stem from an innaccurate perception of my memories about my parents? so uuuuuuuh yeah this post carries a content warning for parental abuse, chiefly physical, I think?\n\nI'm 27, a trans woman, pre-anything, and I'm in therapy. I initially started going because I felt like I generally needed support with being almost entirely closeted outside of the net and needing help with getting the support of my parents. The more I stayed on the more the subject became 'me' overall, and over the year or so I've been in therapy now it's the most productive it's been, rather than just doing tunnel vision on a specific problem. She's on leave right now.\n\nI ended up describing some difficulties I was having with relationships and even just general socialising and it lead to us doing the adult attachment interview. In the course of that, I was describing stuff with my parents. I described some particular incidents where I remembered being pushed against a hard plastic prop in a theme park when I was a kid, another when my mother screamed at me and threw my own shoes at me, and another where I remembered her grabbing me, spinning me around and shoving me onto a curb before storming away. In each of these instances, I had been annoying them prior in some fashion, or misbehaving. There's probably a few others, but those stood out.\n\nI told my therapist about how I would remember these events, rather vividly, every few weeks or so and that the more I talked about my parents over the sessions - which took some effort, as I would avoid the subject earlier on - the more frequently I thought about them. And apparently that, uh...apparently that's not normal? Prior, I had just assumed it was normal to keep remembering stuff like that. We got to the end of the interview, over the course of 3 sessions because I kept crying during it. High on anxiety, high on avoidance. Congratulations. It's a Fearful-Avoidant.\n\nWe continued talking about these things, still do. It was the first time someone referred to what I went through as incidences of abuse. I would always just say to myself, before this, that I couldn't have been abused because my parents cared about me, or it didn't count as abuse because it was inconsistent, because I was never routinely or ritualistically beaten, or that it didn't count because I deserved it.\n\nA few weeks ago, my mother accused me of disrespecting her after not responding to some asinine suggestion. I ended up being made to sit in front of my parents and made to tell them why I will talk about things to a therapist without telling them. So I was upfront about it - 'you have a history of treating me with anger and violence'.\n\nI was immediately met with incredulity. I was made to outline the events. I named them. One of them - the shoes - she said she didn't remember.  Two others - spinning me around and put to the curb, and being shoved against a prop at Legoland - she says I was misremembering. The former, she just pushed me away because I was being (her words) 'such a horrid thing', the latter, she says I fell and they were helping me up (I have cerebral palsy, balance issues - results in overprotective helicopter parents, to boot). Now, I'm not going to say she was wrong. These were years ago. More than a decade. Nearly two decades in one instance. And every time you remember something, you make an imperfect photocopy of it. My perception, built up over the years as I somehow drifted further and further from my parents, may not be perfect.\n\nShe then went on to ask me if I remembered one time that she definitely did hit me - I said I didn't. She explains an instance where she slapped me, because I was misbehaving, and she was mortified afterwards. 'See, you're remembering it wrong, it's all made up.' I felt like we were approaching something, because at least here she was admitting, of her own accord, to some wrongdoing.\n\nThen, she said 'It was probably even just the shock of it then, I didn't hurt you.' My face fell. She admits to actually hitting me once, then justifies it with simultaneous 'you deserved it' and 'it wasn't even a real hit'.\n\nThat's the thing that kept me grounded. That wasn't okay. It wasn't okay to justify it. It wasn't okay to effectively corner me and make me spill the beans over what's going on in therapy because I'm seen as property. But still, the doubt remains - what if I'm wrong about this stuff that happened to me? What if I'm remembering it a certain, innaccurate way, and it's colouring my perception of everything else?\n\nEven if my memories are wrong, though, the effects are there. I struggle with relationships. In bad days I dread getting up and seeing my parents. I feel anxious at mealtimes when I have to be near them. I am very apprehensive about the notion of going on vacation with them. I had trouble talking about them in therapy and when my therapist suggested a roleplay for tackling a subject, I just locked up and couldn't do it. That shit just doesn't come from nowhere, right? And if you want to look at fearful-avoidance as springing from your primary caregivers simultaneously giving you a lot of love and a lot of pain, well that day, where I'm being held and told that they'll 'support me' as a trans person while justifying and denying shit that my mother did to did to me, all from effectively forcing me to answer questions (understand, 'leave the room' is not something that presents itself as an option in my mental landscape) and prioritise my mother's pain over 'being disrespected' above all else, *that's* a big fucking dose of that.\n\nSorry for the long post. It's just all so fucked."

There are different types; however, so here is a\u00a0website that\u00a0gives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder: http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/depression\/guide\/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression?page=2After reviewing these symptoms, if you believe you may have bipolar disorder, then you may want to see your primary care provider or\u00a0a counselor. Bipolar disorder is treatable, but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management. For example, some people may not get regular sleep, but proper rest is important for bipolar management. A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make.\u00a0The good news is that many people live happy, healthy, and productive lives with bipolar disorder. So, if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder, it doesn't mean that things can't get better. There is currently no \"cure\" for bipolar disorder, but with proper medication and lifestyle management, people can do quite well.Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"

My workplace insurance are paying for my doctors appointments, psychiatrist and psychologist appointments, as well as my prescribed medications.\n\nAs a result of my diagnosis, I undergo EMDR with my psychologist, and my Psychiatrist has me on a number of drugs, and also monthly hospital admissions for TMS (trans cranial magnetic stimulation) which greatly improves my mood. My hospital admissions and TMS treatments aren\u2019t covered by insurance because they believe it to be nothing more than placebo....but that\u2019s a story for another time!\n\n\nSo basically, I\u2019m receiving good care, and \u201cmainstream\u201d treatment. I also meditate, exercise six days a week and have a healthy balanced diet. I don\u2019t drink alcohol and I don\u2019t take illicit substances. I try to do everything within my power to work on getting better.\n\n\n\nMy workplace have come to me and my return to work rehab provider to see if there is anything else they can support me with and to see if there is anything else the workplace insurance crowd will fund, while I am still employed there. \n\nI\u2019m being medically discharged from my job, so anything they can pay for in the meantime, I\u2019d love to give a shot. Then if I find something that works for me, I\u2019ll continue to fund myself.  \n\n\nMy rehab provider has come up with a few ideas which are currently being put to the insurance crowd to see if they would fund. These ideas are;\n-life coach\n-group ptsd therapy sessions.\n\n\n\nMy question is, have you heard of any treatment (no matter how outlandish it may seem) that you know of which could possibly help relieve some symptoms of this beast? \n\nHave treatments like acupuncture or hypnotherapy for example been known to help? Any outlandish treatments you\u2019ve heard of or programs you are aware of? \n\nFor example, I\u2019ve heard of psychologists administering mind altering drugs (brought up by my psychiatrist actually - I want to say cocaine?....but I can\u2019t remember. Basically, in a nutshell, the patient takes a medical grade dose of the cocaine(?) and then has a therapy session to change the bad thoughts and feelings associated with your triggers and turn them into good feelings, retraining the brain to feel differently about that traumatic event\/s).  However, in my country (Australia), this treatment is still in the veeeery early stages of recognition. \n\n\n\nAre there programs or treatments (old wives tales even!) that have helped you or someone you know? \n\nI\u2019m trying to brainstorm as many ideas as possible :)\n\n\nAlso, I just want to say - I understand that I am fortunate to have an insurance crowd pay for my treatments. I know not everyone has their medications and treatments paid for by someone else. I am grateful for this silver lining to a shitty rain cloud. I hope I don\u2019t come across as being insensitive to other people\u2019s circumstances. I just want to try everything I can before I am medically discharged - while work are offering to pay, so then I can determine what treatments I do wish to continue financing for myself in the future. \n\nThank you for reading. Sorry if this is all over the place (I took my sleeping medications half an hour ago\ud83d\ude2c) \n\nI appreciate any input.\n\n\u270c\ufe0f"

Hi \/r\/PTSD, first time visitor here. \n\nMy GF has recently been given a definitive diagnosis of PTSD after several runarounds with different doctors\/psychiatrists and I'm looking for pointers on how to help alleviate any pressures or triggers for her, and maybe help her symptoms improve, if possible. \n\nShe's been the victim of sexual assaults on two different occasions and her dad was physically abusive when she and her siblings were young(he was FOB at the time and has softened since, not that I'm excusing him - his actions affect her to this day). On top of this there is a history of depression in her family, which she seems to have inherited, so her moods can be very dark even when she's not triggered. It's hard to know what's what she's suffering from.\n\nShe's been trying different anti-depressants since she was 19, when she started having trouble with school. About 2 years ago she admitted to being suicidal after her previous relationship ended(we had met but weren't a couple yet). She was taken in and seen by a panel of psychiatrists\/doctors who asked her loads of questions and then released her, not really doing anything or giving her any info - she says it was a horrible experience. Her family doctor has sent her to a few different specialists since, all who do an interview with her before bouncing her back to family doctor saying they're not qualified. \n\nThe most recent doctor, a CBT specialist, listened to her about how fed up she was with the lack of progress, he looked through her previous files and interviewed some of the professionals she'd previously seen and was able to find that she'd been given a PTSD diagnosis, which is a step in the right direction, but as a CBT specialist he's not qualified for PTSD so he shunted her back to her doctor. So we're back to waiting for her doctor to find someone who's qualified to help her. We've made progress finally but it's been a pain in the arse.\n\nShe's in college for the third time now, after dropping out twice from different courses. For the first time, yesterday and today, she's had trouble leaving the house to go to her new course. Completing school is very important to her but she's so debilitated she can't get out of the bed\/chair to do anything, and I'm in work so I can't give physical comfort\/encouragement. She's just sitting, stuck to the spot by panic\/sadness. When it's happened before I've asked questions about where the sadness\/panic comes from and she says she doesn't know - which makes it hard for me to give her any kind of solace other than that I love her and am there for her. I want to help more but I can't think of anything else that could help and I'm afraid the pattern that's stopped her from sticking out college before will happen again.   \n\nShe's on Wellbutrin for the day and Seroquel for the night. I'm not delighted about the latter because it's so heavy but it does the job so I'm not saying anything...\n\nI support her, I try to be there for her, I try to be emotionally present and not fatigued with the constant roadblocks. I try to vet media for content that could trigger her and I keep an eye on her in social situations in case I see her start to fade\/get triggered.. I'm fine with it even if it's hard sometimes.\n\nIs there anything I'm not doing\/could be doing\/should stop doing? \nThank you."

Tw: abuse, self-gaslighting, sexual assault, manipulation (basically all types of abuse), mention of people never coming to terms with abuse\n\n.\n\n(Idk whether I actually am gaslighting myself but important to include that Tw regardless)\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe situation I'm in - I'm 21, at university, and I'm honestly shocked at how shitty lots of my peers can be to each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's bullying and have been instances of public shaming which I believe fall under the label of \"emotional abuse\". I know a couple who I think are in an abusive relationship (the woman abusing the man), and I believe certain sentiments within my community normalise female-on-male abuse. I believe that one of my past romantic relationships has been emotionally abusive, I believe that as a kid I was sometimes abused by my Dad, I believe that when I was 18 men tried to manipulate me into sex. I believe that I've abused myself. I believe that I was sexually assaulted in my first year of university..... and then again in my second year..... and then again in my third. I believe that a member of staff sexually harassed me. I believe that in my environment, abuse and inappropriate behaviour between staff and students are normalised. I believe that on my first week there, someone spiked my drink. I believe I faced harassment from other students when I held a student politics position. I believe my housemate emotionally lashed out at me and maybe thought about me in an abusive way. I believe I have a friend who's emotionally abused me (the same one that I think abuses her boyfriend), and that her best friend enabled it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this just leads me to ask myself - am I the problem???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think in some ways I have been unlucky - for whatever reason, I've experienced more mistreatment than average. I think I (wittingly and unwittingly) can put myself in vulnerable situations - like with the student political position, I knew I'd feel very anxious about it and take people's criticisms to heart, but I did it anyway partly cos I felt I'd have to, and partly cos I thought I'd do a good job. And then with my friend who I think abused me, I guess I did see the red flags and (for whatever reason) chose to ignore them, because I thought I could control\/handle it. Same with the abusive ex coming to think of it. So maybe it's that I don't avoid these situations enough?? (Could my trauma have desensitised me to certain warning signs?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then part of me also thinks, is it about how I'm interpreting situations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 17 I went through a highly traumatic series of events, and I was only able to recover by recognising and understanding abuse. I'd experienced things like gaslighting, I became aware of common misconceptions people have - I guess I had to learn about abuse \/ healthy relationships on a logical level, before going on to experience them, because my trauma had been so bad and completely messed up the way I viewed relationships? So I had to reform my ideas step by step using logic\/principles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there's two ways of looking at this - awareness and projection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's definitely true that I see abuse where others don't. Also I don't \\*always\\* mean it as such a seriously bad thing - I mean obviously it's unacceptable, does have a negative impact, and needs to be stopped. But I don't think \"traumatic\" or \"super emotionally damaging\" are prerequisites (though they obviously often come with it) - I think it's just a significant violation of someone's boundaries in a way that doesn't have a reasonable explanation, accompanied by gaslighting or denial (though gaslighting doesn't need to be there when it's severe). So say with my ex - I feel like the emotional manipulation was traumatic, but the specific individual instances of sexual abuse (and the gaslighting that came with those) wasn't traumatic and didn't need to be to \"count\" as abusive?\n\nI can think of someone or a situation as \"abusive\" without thinking it defines them as a person, they'd act like that in all contexts, or that they were consciously meaning to do harm. Whereas I think a lot of people my age use it to describe only very serious \/ extreme behaviour - and people who they think are \"bad\". They're reluctant to identify abuse in those they like \/ love \/ are able to empathise with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it that they're 21, and in denial, and experiencing all the rationalisations and justifications that abused people &amp; witnesses typically do? Is it that a lot of people receive a certain level of abuse, but never \\*need\\* to come to terms with it, because it doesn't escalate, and it never impacts then \\*that much\\*? Is it that they are significantly impacted, and some of them will never come to terms with it (i.e. permanently impacted), but most people will learn and see recognising destructive behaviour (for what it is) as a process they went through in their 20s?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr is it that I'm projecting? I went through a really horrible experience when I was 17. My formative examples of mistreatment are labuse, so is it hard for me to see any type of mistreatment as non-abusive? Black and white approach?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not as if I consider all my friends to be abusive - I have many friends who I don't consider to be abusive. Some of them have mistreated me, but because they've apologised or I've clearly seen it was their fault, I haven't really interpreted it as abusive? And there have been times I've been hurt or disappointed in the past in ways which I consider non-abusive (thinking about it though, instances of abuse do seem to heavily outweigh instances of non-abusive harm when I think about my life experiences).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm generally not a fan of \"everyone else is the problem\", but to me, my interpretations of each experience makes sense, and I've often thought about it a lot? Is it just that I reflect more on things??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk if I'm just sensitive? Do I feel abused by others so easily bc I'm so impacted by them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know no one here can answer these questions, but if you're able to provide insight from your own experiences, I'd really appreciate it?"
