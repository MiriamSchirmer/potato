After my 8am meeting I anxiously checked my phone still no messages. So I called him...nothing. Called on fb messenger...nothing! Finally, around 8:30 he texted me that he was still sick and had been sleeping with his phones ringer off. I about cried with relief. My body was a wreck by this time. Heart beating fast, stomach flip flopping! Mind racing! Can anyone relate?!

I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his \"voice\". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend \"Jay's\" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.\n\nThe next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with \"Jay\". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.\n\nBack when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room.

I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days.

I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. \n\n\nEarlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close.

At least I hope, I kinda don't want Nazis to be beta uprising. Also this reminded me of something else, tangent incoming. The comment I replied to reminds me of a larger phenomenon in this community. I've seen it in other places too. People like playing in an ideological playpen and trying to connect countries or movements to inceldom. A strange example of this is that there's an account here that pops up some time to time that's themed around North Korea. This account (or a similar one, I think there's a couple themed around North Korea) tried to make an argument that North Korea is based because most of the defectors seen are women (and then you have new articles about Kim having sex slaves or whatever and other feminist horror stories). Basically, these accounts have no actual support of North Korea, they're just taking its imagery as some identity. Worse yet they take the whatever the media says about North Korea and then says it's true but that's why North Korea is good (\"based\"). This is just an example. A more annoying example is mylifeistrash who, at least he used to, mentioned China every five seconds and viewed it as the greatest enemy of incels pretty much. And of course you see the defense of nazi germany as a beta uprising. Really shows how far this playpen goes, but all of these special obsessions have their own \"role\" in being absorbed into the mainstream. In the case of the North Korea accounts it's just a strange LARP of a mythical Asian nationalism that actually ends up being anti-North Korea. In the case of mylifeistrash he makes sure to direct us towards China, especially in light if the new primary goal of the Pentagon in countering China. This is sprinkled in with vague all-around anti-authoritarianism. And the nazi stuff is just silly. All of it is silly. Sorry for the rant but I am trying to flesh out words to describe what I've noticed.

I recently came to understand indirectly that my closest friend might be experiencing some symptoms of PTSD for a trauma that might not have seen any resolution. They're a very private person in general and I understand why they would not have wanted to disclose what they did. But their coping mechanisms had gotten pretty disruptive to our friendship, so I found myself asking after what was up and accidentally put them in a position of having to disclose some details to me in order to answer all my questions.\n\nWhile they have never mentioned PTSD specifically, it seems like a strong possibility to me as an outsider. My other best friend has talked with me in depth about his own experiences with PTSD, so perhaps the thought started there in my mind. I don't want to pretend I'm diagnosing her, but I am looking to suggest therapy in general without being insensitive or trigger them by accident.\n\nThey cited extreme dissociation and emotional numbness and specific flashbacks as things interfering with our friendship and their life right now, and while I recognize that I shouldn't and will not come in to their space claiming to know how to do best for them, based on what they mentioned as their plan to deal with this ongoing stress, I am very concerned that they're entirely avoiding the possibility of professional therapy.\n\nEven if they do numb the negative emotions after the next few months of cutting themself off from others for a bit, I'm worried that that could mean there will still be a lack of healthier mechanisms in place.\n\nI definitely don't want to come off to them like I'm digging into their past. This is their fight in the end, but this person is very dear to me. I stated when I first found out that I would be there for them if they needed me, of course, but I know they're not in a place to reach out actively to me. And like I mentioned, they're very private and I've always respected their natural distance. But this flashback-induced isolation felt so different from that that I ended up digging into their privacy way more than usual and accidentally realized it might be partly due to that traumatic event.\n\nI'm not sure how to reopen the discussion briefly just to suggest with the best intentions looking for professional help. I'd love to hear any advice about how to open this discussion or phrase this or even what to avoid saying that would sound too preachy or unhelpful.\n\nI have my own struggle with depression and anxiety that gets in the way of things, but I was really lucky to have my parents' insurance for therapy when I needed it. TMy friend is not necessarily in that same position, and I know that not everyone might be ready to talk to a therapist right away. But I feel like I want to suggest therapy as their best friend who wants simultaneously to give them time and to just make sure they know they deserve help as much as anyone else.\n\nI'm just not sure that advice is solicited in this situation.

And nothing terrifies you more than wondering how long it will take for there to just be one voice left? \n\nEverything in my world, every person, every event, every action, every idea, every desire, can only say one of two things: 'Give up,' or 'Keep trying'. Problem is, it's harder and harder to hear hope. Every decision I make it either to give up or keep trying. Every single one. It's not a decision of whether to go to work or stay home; it's a question of whether I'm giving up today. I never have to decide whether I'm going to do the laundry or not; I have to choose whether to keep trying or not. \n\nOf course, it's not quite that simple, is it? Because every choice has a cost, and that cost is pain. Sometimes trying hurts more. Sometimes giving up hurts more. But it always hurts to know that there's no sense or order to it at all. No matter what I choose, it will hurt. I'll be more tired tomorrow than I was today, it will be more difficult the day after that. So why 'keep trying'? It's a question I have to 'keep trying' to answer, isn't it? Because trying or giving up is not ultimately a question of survival, but of sacrifice. \n\nSuffering is worst when it is meaningless. A man can absorb a universe of pain for a noble purpose, but a prick of senseless suffering can bring him to his knees. At least it's true for me. Perhaps it's an inherent weakness. Perhaps it's a failure of character. Does it matter? I suspect it might have, once, but now that pain has scoured so much of me away I have my doubts. What difference would it make if I was alive or dead? \n\nOf course, the truth is, death would be an immeasurable improvement for me. But in the depths of my soul I know that my life has never been about me. In fact, that barest shred of self-forgetfulness, of selflessness, is the only thing keeping me alive. I wish it was because I was primarily motivated by my care for others, of how devastating my selfish death would be to them, but I suspect it's not. Brutally and truthfully, to deny the reality of my derivative and dependent existence would be to obliterate the last anchor-hold of meaning to life at all. There's little sense in wading through the philosophical underpinnings of the conviction, but there it is all the same. If life is about me, it must be meaningless. If life has never been about me, it is because an objective purpose exists that, by its weight and significance, orients all lives toward itself. \n\nMy pain has banished me into darkness, blinded by suffering to the noonbright hope and meaning that lights my way unseen. But I am not the gravest thing in my universe; hope has far more gravity than I, and my world is trapped in its orbit, however much I stumble and crawl in my blindness. \n\nI wonder if anyone knows how it feels to feel life screaming at you to GIVE UP at every turn. Every voice. Every person. Every interaction. Every hurt. Every pleasure. Every failure. Every season. Give up. \n\nDemons can give voice to things, you know. Quiet, innocuous things take on a beastly aspect. Snarling, sniveling, malicious, monstrous lies, though obvious for their fiendish nature, can be bound up in so much rage and sinew that their roar drowns out their foulness. Familiarity is, after all, just another form of blindness. A man can see a lie for what it is the first time he sees it. 'Give up.' He recoils in disgust at the squirming, grimy thing, and wishes that someone would stamp it out. But if all his world becomes crowded with lies, if they squeeze out of holes in the ground and pile up, growing larger, feeding on pain and fear, until they blot out the son and tower over him with claws and horns, smiling wickedly--well, he must go on about his business. Everyone expects him to, anyway. Perhaps the devils aren't really there. No one else seems to notice them, anyway. But try as he might, he cannot ignore them forever. They fade into the background. They become part of his world, part of the canvas instead of the painting. Nuisances long ignored become companions in time. But the screaming. Oh, the howling of hell that can be heard so loud by the soul of one man yet be silent to all others. The loneliness of it all is enough to drive a person mad. \n\nYou're not supposed to give credit to devils, after all. Focus on the positive, they say. It's not the darkness but the light that will triumph, in the end, so is it not as if the darkness was never there at all? It has no power to drive out or drive back its nemesis; so hope, dear boy! Carry your light and live not in fear of the legions that assail you day and night, but especially the night. \n\nBut they never tell you how naked you are in your dreams. How I wish that angels would visit me instead of demons. Words can't describe what it's like to have nightmares for four years straight. Devils can make you dream about anything they like. Frightful nights once in a long while can only trouble young children. But when demons invade the solace of sleep, it's like your enemy taking up residence in your home. They just wait for you to come home; you can't stay away forever. You can't stay awake forever. There's no refuge from that kind of torment. The more your sleep suffers, the more you need it, the more you suffer.

There is an ongoing complex intense court battle between the 2 of them and her family (who admittedly have always been distant) have chosen to side with the father and isolate\/ostracize my friend. She has been on and off again homeless, and because of this, she made the healthy decision to move in with me and has become apart of my family. \nI love my friend, she desperately wants to overcome this but is struggling with a lot of symptoms, and myself and my parents want to learn how to help her any way we can. \nShe has these dreams where she wakes up panicking and sweating. Last time she told me that she couldnt stop going over what happened in her head, and although i stayed with her, it took a long time for her to fall back asleep.\nShe also has flashbacks where she goes in and out of the present and past. For example last week after volleyball she was triggered by the noisy change room and ended up standing in the corner unresponsive to anyone repeating the words \"its my fault\". I ended up getting her alone away from the rest of the team but i need strategies on how to get her out of the flashback. Ive noticed that when shes a present the hypersensitivity kicks in and everythings crazy loud for her but then she cant hear anything when shes back in her flashback. Sometimes it helps to give a hug or hold her hand sometimes it terrifies or irritates her. I dont know how to get her out of it and i hate to see her that terrified. \nThe hypersensitivity can be super hard too around the house, sometimes shes able to say that something like the dryer is too loud otherwise we'll find her in the corner of her room with her head between her legs in a panic attack. \nWe desperately want strategies to help bring her out of a flashback\/dissociation, panic attack, night terrors and just the general feeling of loneliness and betrayal she deals with daily.

Hi everyone,\n\nI've been working with my therapist on dealing with the aftermath of a traumatic event. Long story short, my father attempted suicide after battling with severe depression. He went missing one morning, and I went looking for him. I found him in his office at work with a gun pointed at his chest. I stood a foot behind him for 30 minutes, begging and pleading, and crying for him to put the gun down. Unfortunately, he shot himself through the chest while I was behind him. \n\nI developed PTSD as a consequence.

Typically by not reacting right away, we are better able to gather our thoughts, see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives, and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation, you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6), while focusing and thinking\u00a0only about your breathing. After doing so, think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck!"},{"id":"55_ptsd","text":"Day 2 quitting weed, a lot of emotions (x-posted to r\/leaves) Hi everyone. So it\u2019s day 2 for me. I started smoking two years ago to self-medicate PTSD. I believe it has turned into an addiction, with me forgoing food and rent in lieu of buying weed (I don\u2019t have a lot of money so I can\u2019t afford this). I think it did help, but has turned into something uncontrollable at this point. I know I can manage my traumas without weed and with healthy coping skills. Today I\u2019m feeling the weight of anger towards people who have hurt me, who have taken away my basic rights as a human being to my own thoughts and feelings. I realized just now fully that when high, it distracts me and I don\u2019t think about all that stuff.\n\nI\u2019m still trying to rebuild my identity. I feel very very very small. I also don\u2019t eat a lot because of stress and have at times gotten to under 100 pounds, which makes me feel so small and weak and powerless in this world. Completely vulnerable. I feel like certain people have taken advantage of me, and shoved me deeper and deeper into the ground, abusively controlling and judging me when no one has any right to make another person feel like this; like everything that I think, do, like, don\u2019t do, don\u2019t like is wrong. I lived with someone who corrected everything I did, gaslighted me, etc. There are a handful of people I got away from but never got the chance to really stand up for myself.\n\nSo now I\u2019m looking at this life I have, no money, no car, no place of my own, underemployed\u2026and I just think\u2026it\u2019s been years of being a doormat and look where it\u2019s gotten me. I\u2019m a people pleaser and never make a fuss with people, I\u2019ve become mute in a lot of situations. I\u2019ve been admitted to the behavioral health clinic several times against my will even though I was not violent and I\u2019m literally just a tiny girl. I\u2019ve been condescended to in those places, belittled, threatened, etc.\n\nAll of this is coming up and I feel frustrated. I don\u2019t necessarily feel angry at these people, because they have their own problems and if they were happy people, they wouldn\u2019t treat others the way they do. But I feel a sense of wanting to be strong, wanting to build my life, and wanting to finally have my confidence back. I have been made to feel like garbage for how I chew, for how I walk, for how I do almost anything and even though I\u2019m not in that abusive situation anymore, I still act and feel like they are right over my shoulder and I don\u2019t have any say in my own life. As if all my thoughts are stupid.\n\nI do not like to feel this, I don\u2019t like to feel angry. It makes me feel ugly and petty. I know how hard life is, even for the people who have hurt me, and I want to feel nothing but graciousness and forgiveness towards them. I guess being clear-headed today is just bringing up a lot of emotions and I\u2019m so grateful I can share my thoughts here. I hope I will one day feel confident and strong and like my thoughts do matter. By taking care of myself, I hope I can get there. I wish wellness and recovery towards everyone here, thank you for reading :cherry_blossom:\n\nMaybe I\u2019m angriest at myself for letting these people have the hold on me that they did have or do have.

I wanted to share here because this sub looked so supportive and because something has been plaguing me for a while. I just decided to make a new account since I couldn't hold this in any longer.  \nTrigger warning for some; child sexual abuse, crude jokes  \nI recently went through an involuntary hospitalization (related to perceived suicidal ideation) and some of my typical behaviours and quirks caused a psychologist to take me aside and ask if I potentially had PTSD. I assumed she wanted this information to diagnose me or put it on my precautions sheet\\*. While curious, I prompted her to share why she thought so, and she replied with, \"I noticed you've been very startled at loud noises throughout the day. At times, you would stare into space and that concerned me.\" Now, I was curious. Although I had a fair share of PTSD-knowledge, I mostly comforted myself with the fact that a lot of them are veterans and just...nullified the possibility of me having it.   \nNow, the quirks I demonstrated were, as aforementioned, me jumping at loud noises and loud voices, being sensitive to touch, and also a strange blanking out. I don't remember what one would call it, but it strikes me as a whelming of thoughts about my \"trauma\" (which I'll explain below) and I can't help it when I'm in it. I feel like I'm there, but I don't hallucinate about it. It's just all the feelings of it, and it feels *terrible* when I have these spouts. I don't know if flashbacks are like this, but I'll read more around this sub and try to pinpoint the exact definition of whatever a flashback feels like.   \nSo, my trauma. To put it short, I was raped by two guys (one over the age of consent, and the other almost there) at the age of 11. When I was 13, I was molested by an uncle. I'm 16 now. I've just been trying to deal with it by...joking. That's the only coping mechanism I have. I, at times, even joke about my trauma. Once, I joked about how I \"need to keep my grades up, otherwise, I'd just be a sex doll.\" It hurts, though. I can't stop thinking about how the incident was and sometimes I'm a ball of tears because of it.   \nSo, what do you guys think? Should I just get over it, or do I have PTSD?

I was afraid that one of them would be someone I knew or worse, one of the people who bullied me.\n\nSo for the first time I truly acknowledged my anxiety and asked why I felt this way....by doing so I confirmed a belief I previously only partly held.\n\n*It is that because I was bullied by so many people (like 15) (ostracized, yelled at, made fun of and told constantly that no one liked me) that it must have been my fault, or else why would so many people mistreat me and even the ones that didnt partake just allow the abuse to happen and even become friends with these people? If they were really doing something wrong surely no one would willingly befriend bullies or not stand up to them when it happened everyday right? Because everyone knew it was going on, they all saw. It must be my fault of this allowed to happen. So I thought that since I caused it, there is something about me that will cause this to happen with other people aswell. Thus i see everyone as a potential bully, and no self talk changed the anxiety when I was out today***\n\nI saw someone I knew and though she smiled at me I shut down and after our conversation I just wanted to go home and I wasn\u2019t even present the entire time, my mind kept going back to memories of being yelled at and made fun of the whole conversation even though she was laughing with me. I kept going numb because I felt like if I emotionally checked out, then any bullying that I expected on her part wouldn\u2019t affect me because I wasn\u2019t emotionally there in the first place. All of which I became aware of is something that always happens but cbd made me more conscious of it, it made me more conscious of things that had already been there but I just ignored\/I had been denying because I didn\u2019t want to accept that I was mentally ill. \n\nSo how do I, I guess stop thinking that I was at fault for being bullied, or even if I WAS doing something wrong that they just exaggerated my flaws and that I am not a monster that will just be rejected and made fun of by everyone across the board?"},{"id":"70_counseling","text":"My husband and I are separated and he doesn't even want to talk to me.

I thought that sex was just a requirement of love. I didnt realize I had been manipulated for months. Thankfully my parents came home early that day and caught him, otherwise I might not have ever realized what he did was wrong. I was 14, he was 19. He tricked me in so many ways. Made me feel special, convinced me I was his one and only. He used the fact that I had recently developed mental issues and wormed his way into my fragile state. He got me pregnant. He never knew, because I miscarried before the court date 3 months later. It was my first time having sex, my first time being pregnant, and my first miscarriage. At 14. I am now 21.

I'd never consider myself to potentially have PTSD but looking up symptoms online made me have a second thought about it. \n\nMy 15-year-older-than-me brother choked me several times during my childhood, possibly with the intent of killing me, because he wouldn't let go until someone would intervene. He started choking me when I was 12, which would make him in his mid 20s. He was NEET back then and still is. He also tortured me in several other ways, like subduing me and pressing his knee into my temple or heatbutting me in the nose as a way to start a fight. I started taking martial arts and self defense classes and I started retaliating against him, when I was around 15. He'd also hit my mom sometimes and I'd protect her. One time while trying to avoid his chokes I cut my head so bad that blood was gushing all over the room - and when I got him off me, he came back and headbutted me in the nose and tried to choke me again, after which I threw him over the table. The whole room was covered in my blood and he was still relentless.\n\nMy aunt had epilepsy and blamed it at me since I was 10. She refused to take meds for it because of me and I'd have to take care of her epilepsy attacks since I was 10, a lot of the times I was home alone with her. Sometimes she'd bang her head and get a huge swelling or blood would be pooling out of her head and I had to take care of her alone countless times. Sometimes after the seizures she'd get really confused, almost insane, babble, take her clothes off and try to go off etc, and I had to stop that. Also, watching someone twitch and curl up and their eyes roll up isn't exactly a pleasant thing to watch, especially as a kid.\n\n6 months ago I beat my brother up, choked him until snot was coming out of his eyes because he was threatening my mom and she finally kicked him out. I'm finally free from his constant threat of violence but I still feel really weird from time to time.\n\nMy aunt also had her last epilepsy attack around a few months ago, because the doctor said the next one might kill her because it's taking a toll on her heart. Still blames me for it though.\n\n----------\n\nMy \"symptoms\":\n\nI know this probably isn't nothing compared what other people go through. I even thought this didn't affect me, I thought most people go through either the same or worse, until I was about 20 years old.\n\nBut once every day, or every 2-3 days, I get intense, intrusive memories about these events. I feel extreme anger and hate, my heart rate goes sky high, sometimes even my hands start shaking. I feel like I can't stop thinking about it, sometimes for an hour or two.\n\nThis usually happens when I'm trying to study or sometimes it even happens while I'm listening to a lecture at my university. Sometimes at the university I just zone out and kind of relive these events, going though them in my head. Other than that, when I'm not going through this, I have a tough time concentrating. I think \"episodes\" happens when I get bored or when my mind isn't stimulated. Like, I don't think they happen if I distract myself with the Internet or doing some hobby that I like.\n\n I remember feeling like this at least once a week ever since I was around 15 or so.\n\n  I used to have nightmares about either fighting for life with my brother or my dad or someone else, or about seizures happening to me or people around me every day. Now I have them maybe once a week or two.\n\nI get something that feels like an adrenaline rush when I'm bringing this up, for instance as I'm writing this, or when my brother decides to visit my mom, and sometimes it just happens randomly.\n\nDoes this sound like PTSD or at least a reason to visit a mental health professional? I honestly thought PTSD accompanied a lot more brutal traumatic experiences, like what you'd hear in war stories.\n\nAlso, I think I've had social anxiety for the better part of my life, but I think that's getting better now.\n\nDoes \"reliving a traumatic experience\" necessarily mean you feel all the sensations you felt back then?
