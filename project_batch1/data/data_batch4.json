        "text":"Just shouting into the void Do you know what it's like for someone to ask about your summer plans, and for your first thought to be, 'I don't even know if I'll be alive by summer.'?\n\nDo you know what it's like for all the noise in the world to boil down to just two voices? And nothing terrifies you more than wondering how long it will take for there to just be one voice left? \n\nEverything in my world, every person, every event, every action, every idea, every desire, can only say one of two things: 'Give up,' or 'Keep trying'. Problem is, it's harder and harder to hear hope. Every decision I make it either to give up or keep trying. Every single one. It's not a decision of whether to go to work or stay home; it's a question of whether I'm giving up today. I never have to decide whether I'm going to do the laundry or not; I have to choose whether to keep trying or not. \n\nOf course, it's not quite that simple, is it? Because every choice has a cost, and that cost is pain. Sometimes trying hurts more. Sometimes giving up hurts more. But it always hurts to know that there's no sense or order to it at all. No matter what I choose, it will hurt. I'll be more tired tomorrow than I was today, it will be more difficult the day after that. So why 'keep trying'? It's a question I have to 'keep trying' to answer, isn't it? Because trying or giving up is not ultimately a question of survival, but of sacrifice. \n\nSuffering is worst when it is meaningless. A man can absorb a universe of pain for a noble purpose, but a prick of senseless suffering can bring him to his knees. At least it's true for me. Perhaps it's an inherent weakness. Perhaps it's a failure of character. Does it matter? I suspect it might have, once, but now that pain has scoured so much of me away I have my doubts. What difference would it make if I was alive or dead? \n\nOf course, the truth is, death would be an immeasurable improvement for me. But in the depths of my soul I know that my life has never been about me. In fact, that barest shred of self-forgetfulness, of selflessness, is the only thing keeping me alive. I wish it was because I was primarily motivated by my care for others, of how devastating my selfish death would be to them, but I suspect it's not. Brutally and truthfully, to deny the reality of my derivative and dependent existence would be to obliterate the last anchor-hold of meaning to life at all. There's little sense in wading through the philosophical underpinnings of the conviction, but there it is all the same. If life is about me, it must be meaningless. If life has never been about me, it is because an objective purpose exists that, by its weight and significance, orients all lives toward itself. \n\nMy pain has banished me into darkness, blinded by suffering to the noonbright hope and meaning that lights my way unseen. But I am not the gravest thing in my universe; hope has far more gravity than I, and my world is trapped in its orbit, however much I stumble and crawl in my blindness. \n\nI wonder if anyone knows how it feels to feel life screaming at you to GIVE UP at every turn. Every voice. Every person. Every interaction. Every hurt. Every pleasure. Every failure. Every season. Give up. \n\nDemons can give voice to things, you know. Quiet, innocuous things take on a beastly aspect. Snarling, sniveling, malicious, monstrous lies, though obvious for their fiendish nature, can be bound up in so much rage and sinew that their roar drowns out their foulness. Familiarity is, after all, just another form of blindness. A man can see a lie for what it is the first time he sees it. 'Give up.' He recoils in disgust at the squirming, grimy thing, and wishes that someone would stamp it out. But if all his world becomes crowded with lies, if they squeeze out of holes in the ground and pile up, growing larger, feeding on pain and fear, until they blot out the son and tower over him with claws and horns, smiling wickedly--well, he must go on about his business. Everyone expects him to, anyway. Perhaps the devils aren't really there. No one else seems to notice them, anyway. But try as he might, he cannot ignore them forever. They fade into the background. They become part of his world, part of the canvas instead of the painting. Nuisances long ignored become companions in time. But the screaming. Oh, the howling of hell that can be heard so loud by the soul of one man yet be silent to all others. The loneliness of it all is enough to drive a person mad. \n\nYou're not supposed to give credit to devils, after all. Focus on the positive, they say. It's not the darkness but the light that will triumph, in the end, so is it not as if the darkness was never there at all? It has no power to drive out or drive back its nemesis; so hope, dear boy! Carry your light and live not in fear of the legions that assail you day and night, but especially the night. \n\nBut they never tell you how naked you are in your dreams. How I wish that angels would visit me instead of demons. Words can't describe what it's like to have nightmares for four years straight. Devils can make you dream about anything they like. Frightful nights once in a long while can only trouble young children. But when demons invade the solace of sleep, it's like your enemy taking up residence in your home. They just wait for you to come home; you can't stay away forever. You can't stay awake forever. There's no refuge from that kind of torment. The more your sleep suffers, the more you need it, the more you suffer. I never expected to understand so well why people kill themselves."

For example I have a lot of trouble sleeping beyond the nightmares, if I hear any noises outside or see a shadow or even my reflection in my bedroom window I am triggered. The last month or so I have started locking and unlocking my apartment doors, 10,20...30 times a night when I am triggered at night. This past week I have been doing it even when I am not triggered, for example when I return from work I will lock the door and then unlock and lock it a dozen times. My therapist suggested giving myself a limit of how many times I can do this and resist the temptation to continue by distracting myself. \nAny tips for this? Between nightmares and triggers my sleep is already disturbed enough, but spending an hour on the doors is really exhausting.\n\nThank you all!"

        "text":"Day 2 quitting weed, a lot of emotions (x-posted to r\/leaves) Hi everyone. So it\u2019s day 2 for me. I started smoking two years ago to self-medicate PTSD. I believe it has turned into an addiction, with me forgoing food and rent in lieu of buying weed (I don\u2019t have a lot of money so I can\u2019t afford this). I think it did help, but has turned into something uncontrollable at this point. I know I can manage my traumas without weed and with healthy coping skills. Today I\u2019m feeling the weight of anger towards people who have hurt me, who have taken away my basic rights as a human being to my own thoughts and feelings. I realized just now fully that when high, it distracts me and I don\u2019t think about all that stuff.\n\nI\u2019m still trying to rebuild my identity. I feel very very very small. I also don\u2019t eat a lot because of stress and have at times gotten to under 100 pounds, which makes me feel so small and weak and powerless in this world. Completely vulnerable. I feel like certain people have taken advantage of me, and shoved me deeper and deeper into the ground, abusively controlling and judging me when no one has any right to make another person feel like this; like everything that I think, do, like, don\u2019t do, don\u2019t like is wrong. I lived with someone who corrected everything I did, gaslighted me, etc. There are a handful of people I got away from but never got the chance to really stand up for myself.\n\nSo now I\u2019m looking at this life I have, no money, no car, no place of my own, underemployed\u2026and I just think\u2026it\u2019s been years of being a doormat and look where it\u2019s gotten me. I\u2019m a people pleaser and never make a fuss with people, I\u2019ve become mute in a lot of situations. I\u2019ve been admitted to the behavioral health clinic several times against my will even though I was not violent and I\u2019m literally just a tiny girl. I\u2019ve been condescended to in those places, belittled, threatened, etc.\n\nAll of this is coming up and I feel frustrated. I don\u2019t necessarily feel angry at these people, because they have their own problems and if they were happy people, they wouldn\u2019t treat others the way they do. But I feel a sense of wanting to be strong, wanting to build my life, and wanting to finally have my confidence back. I have been made to feel like garbage for how I chew, for how I walk, for how I do almost anything and even though I\u2019m not in that abusive situation anymore, I still act and feel like they are right over my shoulder and I don\u2019t have any say in my own life. As if all my thoughts are stupid.\n\nI do not like to feel this, I don\u2019t like to feel angry. It makes me feel ugly and petty. I know how hard life is, even for the people who have hurt me, and I want to feel nothing but graciousness and forgiveness towards them. I guess being clear-headed today is just bringing up a lot of emotions and I\u2019m so grateful I can share my thoughts here. I hope I will one day feel confident and strong and like my thoughts do matter. By taking care of myself, I hope I can get there. I wish wellness and recovery towards everyone here, thank you for reading :cherry_blossom:\n\nMaybe I\u2019m angriest at myself for letting these people have the hold on me that they did have or do have. Maybe I\u2019m angriest at myself for hurting myself in response to their abuse instead of building."

Help Long story, but read if you can. \n\nI came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. \n\nAbout a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. \n\nLots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. \n\nThe day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear \"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said \"one sec\" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. \n\nDuring this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. \n\nSince I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. \n\nIt got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. \n\nDo I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. \n\nI miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. \n\nanything will help. "

Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it \"rape\" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.\n\n\n At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).\n\n\nI hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be \"real raped, choked\" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.\n\n\n2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming \"OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP\" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.\n\n\nOver the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???\n\n\nTL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick \"fetish\". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."

        "text":"Meet the criteria for PTSD, but feel like what I experienced shouldn\u2019t cause this much stress. I\u2019m a 22 year old female. My mom has always had significant health issues and will likely die of her diseases, although when is not clear. This is something that causes me a lot of grief and distress but I have gotten good at compartmentalizing. \n\nA few months ago, we learned she had a heart murmur, most likely due to a heart condition that would require surgery. At the time I worked a stressful job and had been backstabbed by my company. (80 hour work weeks, lying boss.) he wouldn\u2019t give me time off to care for her so I quit. Then we learned it was a mitral valve prolapse, and she definitely needed surgery. \n\nMy mom has a personality disorder and has emotionally abused me at times throughout my life, especially when she\u2019s stressed. So during this time she ostracized and bullied me, and banned me from going to the hospital for her surgery. \n\nIn this time she kicked me out for 2 weeks. I stayed with two shitty people who did shitty things. I also got a horrible stomach virus (we all did) and got to a point where I thought I may need to get IV fluids. I have health anxiety so this was really hard for me. I ended up coming back after those 2 weeks. \n\nI got updates from my dad while she was hospitalized, there were a couple times it was touch and go and they thought it might be time to say goodbye, but she pulled through. Every night I was scared to sleep for fear that she would be dead when I woke up. Gradually I began eating and sleeping less, until one day, a couple weeks or so after her surgery, I didn\u2019t eat or sleep for 3 days. Two doses of Ativan in the ER made no effect. I had a psychotic episode (I\u2019m assuming?) that I don\u2019t remember in which I physically fought the nurses and cussed out my friend. They gave me haloperidol and knocked me out. \n\nI was put in psych for 3 days in a terrible psych hospital where I received no therapy. The MD met with me once and said I have PTSD, but he thinks it\u2019s from an experience I had as a teenager. \n\nBackstory on that: my freshman year of high school, I pissed a girl off and she and her friends cornered me and tried to beat me up. I don\u2019t remember much of it, the adrenaline was in overdrive. The only mark on my body was a bleeding cut above my eye from being thrown onto a table. \n\nIt was about 6 months after that that I began having constant panic attacks. Anxiety and depression deeply colored the next 4 years, as did benzo addiction. \n\nHowever, I never felt fear when I recalled the event. I had no flashbacks or nightmares. I didn\u2019t avoid any reminders of the event. Basically, I didn\u2019t fit any PTSD criteria, except the anxiety and hyper vigilance. \n\nNow, I fit the criteria for it. \n\nI avoid reminders of that time period from the time my mom kicked me out until I got out of the psych ward. \nI won\u2019t watch tv because that\u2019s all I did (unless I\u2019m with someone) \nMy house gives me anxiety because it reminds me of being there alone and afraid. \nI am terrified to sleep alone- I\u2019ve only slept alone in my bed a handful of times since then and it\u2019s always so scary to me that I cry if I have to do it. \nI feel empty and like my life will never get better, I can\u2019t see a future. \nWhen I\u2019m alone I am very afraid. \nI have a loss of identity. \nI feel disconnected to most people. \nI have panic attacks almost daily. \nI struggle to feel emotion, and when I do, I\u2019m either sobbing or wanting to die or hurt myself, I imagine stabbing myself or slitting my wrists to satisfy the urge. \n\nAll the psychiatrists I\u2019ve called are booked out 6 months. I have a doctor appointment this week. Any thoughts? "

Although you say you're happy, I'd suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you're getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. That's a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You can't have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship.

She told me this early on in our relationship but it has never been mentioned since. \n\n\nBut I feel that it is still affecting her everyday life in a very significant way. She doesn\u2019t sleep from\nnightmares, she\u2019s hyper vigilant at all times, often descends into the deepest sadness for days at a time, says the most awful things about herself, she gets faint, sometimes disassociated or shuts down completely, and is so incredibly anxious most of the time. She just isn\u2019t happy or enjoying her life at all. I have in the past gently suggested that she talk to a therapist, not with direct reference to C-PTSD but because she has told me she wants to die, or because of self harm, and this is met with quite a lot of hostility, saying that I thought she was crazy or just shifting my responsibility as a boyfriend on to a therapist, and it has almost lead to break-ups, so I haven\u2019t suggested it in a while.\n\n\nAnother part of it is that within our relationship when I have made mistakes, nothing that I felt was too major - getting a bit cross, or being late to a meet up, it\u2019s been world shattering for her, sent her spiralling down for days. She told me that sometimes she almost cries when she sees me because of the relief and safety it makes her feel. I was so touched that she felt that way but it also made me realise the responsibility I have, how careful I need to be to not make any slip-ups, and why she finds it so hard to forgive little things - if they\u2019ve made her feel this awful I don\u2019t really blame her. And it also made me realise that I actually never talk about how I\u2019m feeling or if I\u2019m upset, because of fear of upsetting her. There have been times when I\u2019ve felt more like a carer than a boyfriend, I feel awful for saying that but it is how it\u2019s felt. It is beginning to really affect me too and I don\u2019t feel that that is sustainable in a relationship. \n\n\nI think that I need to encourage her to seek help,  but to be more upfront and talk about the C-PTSD and how I see her feeling, and to say that I don\u2019t think things can continue with the way they currently are, with her whole world being dependent on me. Because I\u2019ll inevitably slip up from time to time with little things as people do, and I don\u2019t want her to have to feel so so sad when I do. But I do want to be with her, I love her and I want most for her to be happy. But I know that me suggesting this will not go down well. She doesn\u2019t see the symptoms I mentioned as anything more than just situational - she doesn\u2019t like work or she\u2019s just tired. But while the situations have always changed the feelings haven\u2019t. \n\n\nWhat I was hoping was if anyone with more experience of the condition might be able to make clearer is whether I am doing the right thing by suggesting getting help, and if so whether there are specific things I should avoid saying that could make the CPTSD worse, or if there\u2019s a best way to go about it. I don\u2019t want to bring up her old trauma with her anymore than I need to, I really don\u2019t want to upset her with this, but I just don\u2019t feel things are sustainable as they currently are. Thank you for any advice"

I remember vaguely one time when i raised my hand in elementary school and was like \u201cmy daddy cusses alot\u201d or something like that and i thought it was funny as i was only in 2nd grade or something. I feel like I completely blocked out my childhood which my therapist said is a sign of ptsd along with other symptoms i will describe later. As i was saying i blocked out alot of my childhood, i remember when i first started going to therapy when i was 13ish they would ask why i thought my childhood was toxic and what happened and I couldn\u2019t ever describe it in detail, this has happened multiple times between switching psychs and therapists and what i think is one of the main reasons a possible diagnosis was delayed for so long. I also have gotten panic attacks since around the same age (13) and currently have a diagnosis of panic disorder which i think will eventually be changed to ptsd. One of the main things that have effected me due to this was my horrible fear of any type of confrontation no matter how big or small even if it doesn\u2019t involve me, like for example say two people i know get into a small fight and you can feel the tension that could possibly cause me to cry or even have a panic attack. Or if it\u2019s a example that directly effects me like someone raising their voice at me, i will always cry without a doubt which has completely disrupted me having a job. This has also caused me to not be able to defend myself at all and i tend to get walked over ALOT and causes me to get in tons of toxic relationships amongst friendships and relationships. I was also sexually assaulted at 16 by a crush at the time and I don\u2019t feel comfortable going into detail with this part but with the toxic childhood I completely blocked it out so I don\u2019t get flashbacks with that trauma. But i know for sure i get flashbacks from the sexual assault I experienced as well as my mom often shaming me for the clothes i wear. I scream in sleep (night terrors) often as well and i know that can be related but i don\u2019t remember the night terrors but often wake up dissociated for a few minutes after having one. Thank you and i hope no one got triggered by this"

My incident was not as serious as war, somehow I wish I could say that it was. I became suicidal at 13, when I remembered an early childhood event involving a priest when I was very young. I made various attempts to die, but was thwarted In my efforts by consecutive strokes of luck. One example, when I was 17 I tried to do it by drinking a bunch of isopropyl alcohol. Your liver can't beak it down, so I figured it was a sure shot. However, I had already gotten drunk off of JD before I drank it, and that alcohol neutralized the isopropyl. So I lived. \nAnyway, around 19 I got a job working for the state cleaning up highways for peanuts. I liked the work, despite the money, because I was into conservation, and a lot of other hippie philosophy. One of my co-workers captured my heart, and in a not so subtle way I drunkenly confessed my affections at a house party I had for all my co workers. It was bad, I was blacked out by then, but that's as far as it went. I apologized the following morning, but she said not to worry about it. I was mortified regardless, and so I was equally shocked when she asked of I would get an apartment with her the following week. My living situation was deteriorating, as my roommate at the time was using roids, and getting more unstable every day. It would mean I had to commute 45 minutes instead of 5, but I wouldn't be strangled in my sleep. After we started living together, during our transitions to our apartment, things were cool. It was myself, her, her best friend and her friends boyfriend. A little cramped, but it made rent feasible. There's more details but I'll condense the rest, I can't think about it all in depth or I'm going to melt down. Any readers with a respectful curiosity can pm me if they want. I ended up being strung along, gaslit, robbed, and psychologically and emotionally tortured until I confronted her about everything. She admitted through a nasty smirk that she thought it was fun to watch me writhe silently, and that I probably deserved it. Then she surmised that because I was of no further use to her, I would be useless to anyone else. And she told me to finish the job. I broke down, and almost jammed a knife into the nearest light socket. Then I dropped the knife... I couldn't do it. I couldn't leave and hurt my family, but if I'm living for them, is it genuine? Is it really living?\nThat day haunts me still, and I don't have tools that work anymore. Are there any sufferers out there reading that have any tips for someone in my position? I've been having more frequent flashbacks and nightmares about her, and that whole experience. Please help.\n"

I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent\/ramble\/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)\n\nI had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. \n\nI've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. \n\nNope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. \n\nAnd then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then \"wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?\" \n\nAnd then the floodgates started to open. \n\n*  \"Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable\"      \n* \"Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.\"      \n* \"I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me. All two of the physical fights I have been in, have been with him when he was in the house and I snapped after he wouldn't leave despite me begging mom to have him leave\"      \n* \"What are the other symptoms of ptsd? (googles) ... disturbed sleep? ...\" (i am a violent sleeper. i dont put sheets on anymore as they 100% always are ripped off as i thrash in my sleep\"     \n* \"and... shouting in your sleep? ......\" (no conscious memory, but apparently every night i shout out things. my mom doesnt mention it much anymore unless it was a bad night, but whenever i share a hotel with someone I wake up to \"why were you shouting \"stop go away stop\" at 3 AM?\")           \n* \"what else cou- nightmares too?\" (never related to trauma in a way i can discern, but have nightmares that wake me up screaming in about 1\/3 sleeps)             \n* \"exaggerated startle response? Does that mean what I think? ... Yes. ... fuck...\" (its not quite as severe anymore but i used to invariably freak out if someone touched me without me seeing it. My dad(never hit me, never abused me, was the chill parent) used to poke me in the car at random, just jokingly. I would flinch and recoil every time. Eventually I got to a point where I would sit pushed against the passenger side door to try and get away from it. He asked me at the time why I flinched and got scared, he never hit me. I didnt know why I did that but I couldnt stop. Now I dont do well with people touching me at random, surprising noises, loud bangs, sirens and fire alarms)   \n\nIt was like I was looking at a connect the dots, and the dots were all in a straight line in numerical order. I got deeply confused. Why hadn't I ever talked to my psychiatrists about this? Why didn't I realize I have flashbacks weekly or more? Why didn't I realize hearing aggressive shouting is very prone to do this, even from strangers in public, or in film\/tv? Why didn't I realize my reaction to the memory or presence of my moms abuser far exceeds what is normal? Why did I not connect my hatred of his face, Heineken, the smell of spilled beer, or his cologne with this? How did I never admit this? Any of this? Why did I always deny I had trauma issues or dodge the question so deftly, all the while completely unconscious of what I was dodging? What the fuck do I do now? \n\nI feel like I wasn't hurt badly enough. I wasn't the direct target of any of his violence until I was an adult. It wasn't sexual or combat related. It didn't ruin my life(depression did that for me) like my friend, who I knew disassociates for hours and wakes up multiple times nightly from the nightmares. I feel guilty for even considering it, but I detect too many characteristics that line up for me to ignore it. I'm making an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I've been seeing psychiatrists for 9 years by now and I've never done this. \n\nMy sense of self and my understanding of my mental health has been destroyed. I feel like I was assembling a jigsaw puzzle of myself, was mostly done, and perhaps 40% of the puzzle just got torn off, mixed up, and the pieces thrown across the floor. I've always felt that if nothing else, I knew what happens to my brain. I thought it has been the same for years now. That there wasn't more to discover, just need to work more therapy and cope better. But there's been a giant red neon sign saying \"THESE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS YOU DOLT\" here the whole time and I've been blind to it. What else could I have missed? How deep does this trauma stuff run? How am I supposed to self evaluate when I can apparently never be objective about these things? What use is talking about ones symptoms if I managed to perfectly lie to myself and to my doctors and therapists for all of these years?\n\nIt's so plainly obvious, I think I must have subconsciously been refusing to accept it. To protect.. something. That's why I think I was able to take off the blinders about this when I was uninhibited through the drugs I took to calm down. Its my only thought I've managed to come up with regarding why I never saw the plainly obvious truth, and instead unconsciously denied and avoided, with expert skill, connecting the symptoms to trauma. Even the flashbacks. I always just thought I was being dramatic and emotional. I never had a thought about them beyond \"oh just ignore it\". Even though I knew what PTSD commonly presents as. Even though I didn't think I was hiding anything or that I would hide anything like this. \n\nI'm talking to my psychiatrist soon. I don't look forward to it at all. I have a feeling it will be awful trying to say any of this. I don't even know what's next. I am not able to reduce my exposure to my triggers. I can't control him. My mom thinks I should like him and has never understood how upset I get. Even when I (of all people, never hurt a fly, never wanted to fight anyone, ever) have been so upset by his presence, combined with hearing his inescapable voice in my bedroom, that I attacked him. Two different times. I can't even type this post without crying from this. Talking. Ugh. :(\n\nSorry for this huge wall of text. I'm just. My brain feels like scrambled eggs. So many questions. Feel so lost about who\/what I am as a person and what my mental illness means and how they affect me. It's seemingly all gone out the window and I'm put back at the start. Need to start working on writing stuff down for my appointment so I can't conveniently forget to mention it. \n"

So when I started working at my dream job at a dog hotel I thought that this was the best job I ever had. Physically, demanding yes, but fun and rewarding. \n\nIt was a month and a half into my new job when I was attacked by a pit bull. The dog was special needs which usually means he was dog aggressive which he was. What this boils down to is that I took him out to play in the morning, and again in the afternoon.  The Pit had seen a dog next door and lost it. I went through protocol to redirect his attention to me so that we could continue to play, but when none of that worked sp I squirted water onto his neck.\n\nAll that agression redirect to me, and he gave me no indication that he was going to attack so it surprised me when he jumped up going straight for my throat. Luckily I reacted and punched him in the face. Here I am moving cars and trash cans using them as buffers between me and the dog until he brings me down, and goes ham on my leg almost to the point of breaking it.\n\nLong story short it's been five months since this event, and my official diagnostic of PTSD. Isn't getting any better even with the help of my therapist. Nightmares always escalate to where the Pit snapped my neck. \n\nI just needed to post this. I was too afraid to put it on my normal social media accounts because the back lash from pit bull sympathizers,  and to me it dosen't matter it was a pit bull it could have been any dog breed. It just makes life hard when even the smallest of dogs prevent me from enjoying life, and when I feel conflicted about my love of dogs especially when I live in a highly populated dog area."

The first year i was just really disabled and lost interest in everything. the next two years i decided to get more mobile, but then i had anger attacks and anxiety attacks (even when i wasn't angry, something i had no idea could happen before that).\n\nSo this year I started getting therapy, something i SHOULD have done a long long time ago. Things have been going good so far. I keep improving and I have days where i actually feel positive.\n\nThe hardest part still, it just like... getting physically active in order to do daily thing.

This is the first time in my life I've ever had therapy and it's really hard because talking about it (especially in a group setting) triggers so many painful memories and emotions that I've suppressed for 15+ years. I've been sleeping even worse than normal, which has worsened my daytime sleepiness. \n\nMy doctor had recommended Seroquel a while back, but I refused because I read that it can cause weight gain and other problems. Well, I finally surrendered because I felt like I was going to have a psychotic episode if I didn't start getting  more sleep. \n\nLet me tell you, I only took 25mg last night and it mellowed me out. It was like somebody turned the volume down on the racing thoughts and anxiety about going to sleep. I was dead to the world! I'm still quite groggy today and dozing off randomly, but I forgot that I needed to take it earlier than 10pm. \n\nSo we'll see how the rest of it goes.

Also, skit to the asterisk to skip several bleak accounts of some bad times and to the point of this post) \n\n To clarify, I am not diagnosed with ptsd and am by no means claiming to have the disorder. I exhibit many of the symptoms I have read about, but obviously that is by no means a diagnosis. I post this here, as reoccurring issues I have really been struggling with fall under the symptoms of ptsd, and ultimately, for lack of a better place to do so. If anyone knows of a more appropriate place I may voice my concerns to, feel free to correct me and I shall be on my way. \n\nRegardless, let me begin. \n\nI am fourteen (turning fifteen this month), and last year around this time I began a relationship. Although beginning deceptively normal, it quickly and suddenly spiralled into a cycle of abuse, crudely disguised as love. It began with my communication with her having to be constant, unfaltering; this was preferable to the threat of her becoming upset and ignoring or guilt tripping me - or really using any emotional manipulation tactic that you can think of. \n\nWithout me really being able to grasp what was happening, I had been fully isolated from my friends and family, and really, the whole world. She had dragged me into a delusional foli\u00e9 a deux, in which I constantly faced the threat of rejection, shame, dread, isolation and a whole selection of other rotten, empty feelings. \n\nIn addition to the emotional abuse, she coerced and manipulated me into engaging in sexual acts with her, despite me outlining specifically that I did not want to do so. \n\nSex became the only way for me to feel as if I was good enough for her, and bore some of the only moments at which she seemed happy and pleased with me. It was exhausting and bestowed on me deep, deep guilt, but if I were to refuse she would emotionally blackmail me and because deeply upset. \n\nShe escalated these sexual encounters to the point of extremity, forcing me to buy condoms when I was on the verge of tears. After these sexual encounters i would often cry, and grow increasingly dislodged from my own body, as it was my only coping mechanism to escape the abuse.  I did everything I could to avoid the same occurrence again; dropping change so we wouldn't have the \u00a32.90 for the condoms, refusing to leave the house if I knew that was her intent, fabricating lies about whatever I had to. \n\nI remember once, after telling her I didn't want to, the look on her face in a moment of brief lucidity which interrupted her brigade of plastic emotion, when she mentioned casually that if she got me to agree, then it would essentially be rape. \n\nThe further our relationship progressed, the more distant from reality I became, the further I grew from my family and the further my timid self retreated inwards, in hiding.\n\nMy travelling to France during the holidays exhibited some of the worst torment I had faced, despite not being in person. Her behaviour was amplified and she still had me almost completely under her illusion, although she was slowly losing her grip.\n\nShe would demand to have the passwords to all of my social media, and dig up conversations from months, years prior to dig up as evidence of cheating and disloyalty, only to ignore me for as long as she deemed appropriate and make me feel as guilty as she knew how to.\n\nWeeks before the end of our relationship, she joined me on a family caravaning holiday, which was, in hindsight, hell on earth. Her unrequited jealousy, especially towards my mother and sister, was uncontrollable and beyond reason, and her iron stare haunted the cosy metal box. I looked into her eyes and saw a deep, burning hatred, and became terrified of her. On a particular evening, when the rain was mercilessly beating down on the drooping tents, I was required to accompany her to the toilets, despite her ignoring me. Upon me attempting to talk to her, she quickly turned the corner and abandoned me at a swift, unforgiving place. I, of course, had no idea where on earth she was (she had a nasty habit of doing this) and in my delirious, desperate, confused state, my brain fabricated these tall, black figures who had taken her, as if to create a reason where it was not provided anything remotely attached to reality. Upon being found by my father, urgently pacing around looking for her, hysterical, she expressed no sympathy or concern, but simply offered an empty, dry sorry. \n\nThere are countless other situations I could site, but I think that these I have documented here serve the purpose of explanation well enough. \n\nIn august of last year is when it hits it peak and when I finally severed my ties with her. A barrage of insults following an exhausting, draining, empty argument was my breaking point, and in my desperation I reached out to my present family and family friends, who pointed out to me the reality of the situation. \n\nUpon reflection, it is clear to me that her actions were a result of her own past trauma, and I hold nothin against her. I have learned that holding anger in your heart does nothing but create more pain and sorrow. I also realise that I was so susceptible to her manipulation, as my mother struggled and is struggling with mental health issues, which lead to her being admitted into hospital for spells of time from when I was about 10-13. I knew she also had mental health issues, and subconsciously i believe I wanted desperately to make her happy because I never could make my mother happy, and felt as if it were my fault. \n\n*****I am posting here as, these events and feelings haunt me daily. They haunt my dreams, replay over and over in my head, bore their way into my skull like parasites, prevent me from ever just sitting alone with my thoughts, keep me disconnected from my feelings, sensations, my passions. I feel as if I am carrying around with me an immense guilt and sorrow. No matter how much I think I've made peace with my feelings, forgiven, and tried to move on, I have always been dragged back into this seemingly inescapable vortex of foggy, unclear, jumpy memories and an indescribable, constant feeling of dread and guilt. \n\nEvery time I see her name, hear mention of her, pass her in a corridor or even think of her, I receive an unpleasant jab of adrenaline, and my heart races uncontrollably. Any smells or objects that remind me of her provide the same painful jolt and can send me spiralling into despair. \n\nI am desperate, alone, but I still have so much life to me and I am scared to lose it. I want to set myself free. \n\n(sorry for any issues with coherency and te length. this seems to have provided a lot of therapeutic value, and that is most likely it's primary function. to expect someone to read this much of something so bleak is unreasonable)\n\nIf somehow, you read this far, thank I thank you greatly for briefly indulging in my troubled thoughts, and I wish you the best. \n\n"

Since my own military sexual assault in the Marines, 3 months before 9\/11, there have been approximately 1.4 MILLION other victims in the military alone. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I have had the privilege of joining and chatting with numerous social media groups formed to support PTSD and Military Sexual Trauma (MST) survivors.\n\nThere are thousands in these groups, yet there are millions more suffering on their own. PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy. We feel alone, so we become alone.\n\nTo show those that there is hope even though the battle wages on, and to help PTSD survivors and their families, I am sharing my story.\n\nMy story is not unique. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I share this story to let others know they are supported, they are loved, they are not alone, and they too can thrive with PTSD.\n\nIn my 17+ years of living with PTSD from MST, I have struggled and I have persisted. Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.\n\nIn the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain. After years on this journey, I have decided to write a book about my experience.\n\nThis book is currently in pre-order sales and will be for the next 24 hours. The journey offers some parallels to The Alchemist and Forrest Gump, though this journey is true.\n\nYour support would go a long way to ensure this story gets told and the conversation around PTSD really gets started. [https:\/\/publishizer.com\/relentless-1\/](https:\/\/publishizer.com\/relentless-1\/) . \n\nHelp me help the masses understand this condition so that the silent suffering of millions can end.\n\nThank you for your time."

My entire life I was literally scared of everything. Every guy that passed me on the street (still dealing with this one). Stair wells, parking garages, elevators, being alone, being with people, family, friends, friends of friends, the dark, I could literally go on and on! I spent every second of everyday scared, all because someone decided to hurt me as a child. PTSD never crossed my mind. I thought that was something only service members got diagnosed with. I never told anyone of my abuse until I was in my 20s, but even then I didn\u2019t deal with it. I didn\u2019t date until I was out of high school because I was so uncomfortable around men. If I ever met someone that didn\u2019t scare me, I KNEW they must have been a good person, because that NEVER happened! It wasn\u2019t until I turned 30 that I went to a therapist and started to deal with what happened to me. I am finally living a somewhat normal life. I still have many fears, but I don\u2019t spend everyday terrified of life and things that COULD happen. For that I am very thankful!"

TW: violence\n\nFor almost 3 years now I've been struggling with a PTSD that I got from being assaulted in public twice in a row in the span of 2 months. Since this was pretty public and the public was very apathetic to it it caused me to feel very worthless. I felt a lot of resentment for other people. Since then I've had anger issues. I got pretty good at hiding this though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn these last 3 years violence has played a big part in my routine mental thought. If I was mad at someone, even for the slightest smallest \"infractions\" towards me, I would fantasize about hurting them in some way. Life was mostly good, but I'd spent hours pacing around my apartment thinking about how people had \"crossed\" me that day, and how they were going to pay for it. It is really scary stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil today I always had to put in concious effort to stop when I caught myself having these involuntary fantasies. But today, for the first time, I caught myself in a fantasy and reflexively got myself out of it. It almost feels like my body finally realizes that I don't actually live a violent life, and that I can tackle my problems in other, healthier ways. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've learned to function with my PTSD for a long time now (therapy yay!), but this feels like the biggest step towards recovery yet. I really hope this trend continues, because sometimes I'm still afraid that one day I might slip up, and do something that I would regret. Luckily that hasn't happened yet, and things seem to get easier with time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave any of you folks ever felt like they where \"stuck\" in a violent state of mind? How do you guys cope with it?  Are you guys hopeful for a full recovery or do you believe that PTSD is something you have to learn to live with? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Anger issues due to PTSD for long time, it feels like they're getting less."

I have nightmares sometimes, and panic attacks pretty often, but I also started passing out and \u2018losing time\u2019 and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related to PTSD or if it\u2019s a different thing, so I\u2019m wondering if anyone here has had any related symptoms. I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right place to post it, but honestly you guys seem like a good community (this is more or less a throwaway, but I\u2019ve been lurking for a while on another account). And I know that it says no medical advice, and I don\u2019t know if this would really fall into it- I\u2019m seeing a doctor regularly, and I don\u2019t want advice about what to do more than just wanting to know if this is something other people experience. Anyways, when I black out it doesn\u2019t feel at all like a panic attack, my vision goes dark while when I have a panic attack my vision goes bright and everything looks white. Also, during panic attacks I feel over sensitive\/ every sense seems alarmingly heightened, but when I pass out it just feels like I completely lose control, everything goes black and I can feel myself falling and then I wake up. Ive checked with my doctor to see if it could be caused by heart problems as they run in the family, but all results came back completely normal. Honestly I didn\u2019t even think of it being related to PTSD until a friend suggested it. Along with passing out, there has also been days where I look at the time and realize that somehow four or five hours passed by without me recalling any of it. I don\u2019t use any substances, and honestly it\u2019s a fairly scary experience and I don\u2019t know if any of you have felt anything like that that ended up being related to PTSD.

My family is very twisted so I avoid them at all cost but my mother recently revealed that I \"may have been\" (her words) sexually assaulted by my uncle, who molested her. I witnessed him attempt to molest her when I was younger, so I don't doubt this.\n\nHe was a very abusive to my family (we lived with him on\/off till I was 15) because he was a mean drunk and would cut phone cords and start physical fights with my grandparents and my mom. I remember he used to tie me up with duct tape and cover my mouth and would keep me in his room. I don't remember if anything happened but after my experience with sleep paralysis - I'm kind of messed up and feel like I do remember now. \n\nI hope I am making sense because I am on high-alert right now.\n\nI felt my mind wake up but I couldn't move my body.

We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. \nI was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn\u2019t feel like I was getting better. \nI was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn\u2019t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. \nI saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I\u2019m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. \nI\u2019ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. \nMy medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. \nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can\u2019t handle my grief, I can\u2019t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It\u2019s absolutely horrible. \nI\u2019m a hairdresser and I\u2019ll have clients say certain words to me like \u201chang\u201d \u201ccloset\u201d \u201cdied\/death\u201d \u201cbrother\u201d or make jokes about suicide even though it\u2019s completely out of context I\u2019ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It\u2019s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don\u2019t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. \nI hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can\u2019t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. \nIt is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I\u2019m not ready to explain to the people around me what I\u2019m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. \nIt\u2019s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don\u2019t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. \n\nI can\u2019t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I\u2019m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn\u2019t like me. Advance on getting over that fear would be so appreciated because I KNOW I need some serious therapy right now and my family tells me all the time. Does anyone have any good skills in these areas? Please help me. I\u2019m suffering and I know damn well I can\u2019t go through the rest of my life like this. \n\nTLDR \u2014 My baby brother committed suicide last year, and I ended up developing PTSD from it; I have been having extreme flashbacks and my therapist stopped treating me due to my diagnosis. I really need advice on coping skills for flashbacks &amp; how to be vulnerable to another professional."

I then developed panic disorder and other issues. Less than a year ago, I was re-evaluated and the persisting symptoms that were originally attributed to PTSD were instead attributed to a different diagnosis. I initially straight up refused to accept the new diagnosis as it was made by an external therapist who didn't and still doesn't really know me. I still am not convinced I fit the criteria for it, and the more I read about it the more I suspect some of my traits and behaviours were grossly misinterpreted and 'bent' to fit the criteria. PTSD is still what makes the most sense to me. Hence why I'm posting here for now. \n\nAbout a month ago I was in a really dark place and didn't know what to do to help myself. I created this account and joined this sub, the CPTSD sub, and the sub dedicated to my current diagnosis. I was hoping I could either come to terms with my new diagnosis or find more evidence that I might have been misdiagnosed to use as future reference, once I'll be able to choose my own therapist. \n\nI can't say I achieved any of that. I feel lost, confused, trapped. But after a month+ of lurking, reading, trying to make sense of things I did figure out the number one factor preventing me from feeling like I fit in - here or in any of the three subs. I believe it's the fact that I'm completely responsible for my trauma. \n\nAnd no, I am not a victim of abuse convinced it was their fault. My trauma was objectively my fault. It wasn't intentional, I didn't mean for it to  happen. But it did, and it was my fault. \n\nI guess when I joined I was really hoping to find even just a few people with a similar 'profile' as me, somewhere on Reddit. No such luck thus far. \n\n**TL;DR:**\nIs there anyone else here, PTSD diagnosed or not, who can objectively say the trauma they experienced and have been suffering from was the direct cause of their own actions? \n\nWhether intentional or not. \n\nI am honestly desperate to find people that can understand this guilt. I feel very alone rn. Please, do reach out if you can identify with this. If you don't want to out yourself commenting, I understand. Please consider DMing me. I am a good listener.

We became great friends.. no odd behavior was shown by him.. we would text for hours about games, our scores and how we can work our way up the leaderboards.. well, that normality went on for about two years. On the third year, Timothy started exhibited odd behavior. He insinuated he was into illegal porn and stuff like that, but I took it as a joke because he would always joke around all the time. (By now he has my phone number) That went on for the rest of the year. On the fourth year, he would joke around about raping minors every day of the week. He did it for about six months.. then some idiot leaks my first and last name to him and state, so then that makes me paranoid. By then, I block him and I haven\u2019t spoken to him in a year. It\u2019s been a year.. blocked Timothy on all social media, I removed all my online shit, I\u2019m totally ghosted. He never said he would hurt me... and he probably understands why I left.. I think. Maybe not. Anyways. I\u2019ve been having paranoia all year that he\u2019s going to come after me and kill me for leaving the friendship. He never said that though. Is this a form of PTSD? Will he really track me down with my first and last and kill me? His toxic behavior makes me paranoid enough to believe that even though I know he won\u2019t... but I need reassurance. Please help me. I\u2019m tired of being paranoid. "

We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date. We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. Then one day, she went to her family\u2019s house on Thanksgiving and everything changed. Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. We had finally found each other. We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didn\u2019t understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldn\u2019t do it at all anymore. I was crushed!\n   A few days later, she tells me how much she\u2019s missing me and \u201clet\u2019s get together for lunch\u201d or something like that. Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her child\u2019s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesn\u2019t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself. We have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn\u2019t work out for her, we will try again. I\u2019m completely in love with her, and I\u2019m in extreme pain."

Her reaction sucked, but she has lived a pretty privileged and trauma-free life so I didn't expect her to get it. And then we stopped hanging out. Suddenly she was always busy, and found other people to spend all her time with. She was my only friend in this whole state, so it sucks a lot. Worse, we share an office and many job responsibilities.

I used the term \"My woman\" because I didn't want him to know her name.\nI hope the post works this time.\nI hope that some of you can relate and that it brings a bit of hope, among all the anger that infects us.\n\nDear Tom\nIt's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.\n\nI wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.\n\nPeace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that.\n\nI also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask \"how's school?\", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than \"good\" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.\n\nSo you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9\/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be \"normal\", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be \"normal\" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what \"normal\" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness.\n\nThe affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger.\n\nI have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.\n\nMy anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say \"What's wrong with you?\". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.\n\nMy depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.\n\nSince my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come.\n\nI'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well.\n\nYou have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect.\n\nYou used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line \"you're destroying this family\" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted.\n\nBut now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said \"you're destroying the family\"; what you meant was something different. \"Family\" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, \"Family\" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was \"you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear\" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me.\n\nYou'd also say \"I put a roof over your head\". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. \"I did my job, so now you owe me\". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the \"family\".\n\nYou aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.\n\nI could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle. As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The \"zig-zag\" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom.\n\nWords can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that \"my kid is dying\" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.\n\nYou might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your \"gifts\". The toys were a way of saying \"sorry I bashed your head the other day\", or maybe \"please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute\". The car was a way of saying \"please disappear\". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was \"destroying the family\" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a \"bad investment\" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple \"grudge\" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your \"gifts\".\n\nSometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. \"Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years\", \"nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?\", \"nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?\", \"nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?\". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in \"raising\" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and \"destroy the family\".\n\nAnother inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day.\n\nI tried to explain what it was like to be \"raised\" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.\n\nMoving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.\n\nI'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.\n\nOn days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me.\n\nI think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now.\n\nIt's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.\n\nThis letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to \"destroy the family\"."

He knows a lot of my history but until I was pregnant my husband had never seen a panic that didn't have an outside trigger. There was nothing he could do to stop it though he did admit after that if I had said no to the epidural in the labour room he was going to find a way to go around me, for my own sake. The midwife honestly looked like she would have been tempered to help especially since she told me to get one instead of suggesting it. Not that I needed convincing.\n\nI hadn't slept in 2 days and still had to give birth.\n\nIt took a long while to shake off the feel of that panic and helplessness but seeing my healthy, happy bub helps a lot. I don't regret going through that for him, but I've never wished more that during that 84 hours that I didn't have to go through my abuse to begin with. Luckily, I'm doing better and am stable when dealing with my mother (abuser\/enabled other abuse). \n\nThe labour made me realize her behaviour put my son at risk and if I get blinded by panic and rage when even hearing about her she still controls me and that just gives the triggers more power.\n\nI just wanted to share cause I'm happy with my progress, even if it's only a little, and wanted to share with others who could understand."

I can usually force myself to speak if I know it's a simple *thanks* or *yes\/no* but other than that, I only speak vocally to people I trust and they can be rare. I have a service dog for multiple reasons which usually causes people to stare or make comments to me (not all that nice of comments either), do to my trauma this kinda puts me into a mild fight or flight mode. I've tried patches on my dog telling people not to approach me or speak to me, surprise surprise, people don't read. All anyone sees is PUPPY! \n\nRecently I was thinking about getting one of those japanese face masks usually used for cosplay or pollution and personalizing it to say \"mute\" on it. Do you think that would help my chances of people backing off a bit? I'm doing my best to learn sign language also but even trying that in public seems to just get people to think I'm deaf, that usually ensues worse comments about my service pup and people trying to take advantage of me. I wear a medical alert bracelet that states I'm a selective mute but it also lists some other info so I'm not really inclined to just show it off if I can't speak.\n\nI'd really like to know what you guys think and if you have any other ideas on how to combat this! I'd also like to say that I've tried just walking away from people when it's too much to handle but it's gotten to some very uncomfortable points, there have been times that I was followed, my service pup barking at a guy who tried to pet him and talk to me when I was already struggling to tell him to back off, and some other stuff. \n\nTLDR: Do you think a personalized face mask that says \"mute\/selective mute\" on it would help people back off when I'm in public and can't speak?"

You have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel. Most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them, and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so that's a good thing. But your \"alarm system\" is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across. As you age you understand this more, and it's true...that other people really aren't thinking about you much or monitoring you at all; they're too busy having the same thoughts you're having! Am I good enough? Do people like me, judge me...think I'm weird? We're all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across. Like many people, you lack compassion for yourself, acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself.\u00a0My gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past. Our sensitivities usually come from (as well as genetics) a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times.

I fell from approximately 50 ft and was kept alive by my two best friends until I was loaded into a helicopter five hours later. I lost seven teeth, crushed the right side of my face and broke my left humerus. While it's not ideal, I've accepted this moment in my life and the results of it. In a roundabout way, it's lead to one of my best friends meeting his now-fiancee and put me on a positive direction in life as opposed to bouncing around from job to job.\n\nOver the past couple of years I dealt with roughly one dream a week reliving the experience and waking up in a panic. For the past year I've been going to a rock climbing gym and the dreams have largely stopped. I still avoid ladders and other heights, but I'm comfortable on the rock wall. I'm not as daring as others there, and it really limits the difficulty of climbs I can complete because I don't put myself out there as much as I could to make the more difficult moves. Sometimes I fall, but it's generally expected. Or I jump off because I'm worn out. \n\nToday I had an unexpected fall. It was only from about 7ft, but my foot slipped, just like it did in my accident. I hit the ground awkwardly, but unhurt and didn't stop shaking for an hour. I was on the verge of tears as I left the gym and bought a pack of cigarettes (I've been on an ecig for a few months). To top it off, I had to go in for a work meeting where the manager tore into us for the general decline in standards that's occurred lately, which is a whole other story.\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm still on edge, and I don't want to sleep because I know I'll have a dream where I fall, or I lose my teeth, or crush my face or something. I was doing so well, and I know it's just a bad day, but I'm terrified that this step back will have more of an impact. I just need someone who's been here before to tell me something that helps."

In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. \n\nAt 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. \n\nThe doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said \"what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?\" I said I didn't know what was wrong. \n\nAfter they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. \n\nThey discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a \"nasty fever\" and told me to rest for a few days.\n\nAt 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. \n\nPositive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.\n\nBeing septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. \n\nI returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). \n\nNow I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well \"hey, she didn't have cancer\" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. \n\nI constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. \n\nThank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest. "

The abuse (molested) started in preschool and didn\u2019t stop until December 2015 or 2016. \n\nIn addition to being a CSA survivor, I lost my mom May 30th, 2019.

Anyways, I had a dream I watched her die of a heart attack and sure enough 3 days later she died, most likely of a heart attack. My dad and I had gone to the store and when we got back she was face down on the floor, next to her bed. We had only been out for 40-50 minutes. I had my brother call 911 while I took our dogs in my room so the paramedics could do their thing. I knew she was gone soon as I saw her body. After I don\u2019t know how much time passed she was declared dead. I still had to stay with the dogs because of the medical examiners and funeral home people, so after some more time passed we shut the door to my parents room so I could talk with our pastor and cry with my family. Soon as I saw the foot of the body bag I walked to my room with my back turned to it. I didn\u2019t want to see her get rolled out... but just when I thought the funeral people had already taken her outside, I turned around. It was a mistake. I saw her face in the body bag as they rolled her out and no matter how much everything told me to look away, I couldn\u2019t. \n\nEver since then I\u2019ve had countless dreams where I see her die, see my friends go missing and\/or end up dead, and see my dad die. I also experience flashbacks that replay the scene of the night she died. I also have flashbacks to when I was molested even though it\u2019s been almost 3 years since it stopped. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me because when the flashbacks start, they don\u2019t stop."

I have trouble accepting the term, because subjectively it wasn\u2019t a big deal and I *shouldn\u2019t* feel this way.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, I reached out to a couple girls who were involved because I was looking for clarification on what actually happened, if they even remembered anything at all.\n\nOne of the girls (now a woman, I guess, over twenty years later) said to me, \u201cit\u2019s all water under the bridge now\u201d, and I\u2019m all emotion over this. I mean, she\u2019s right. It ought to be. And I hate myself for being so affected by something so seemingly minuscule. But that\u2019s just the thing.\n\nIt did affect me. It still affects me, to this day. There\u2019s not a day that goes by that my little third grade experiences don\u2019t haunt me. And there is so much shame and self hate tied to that.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m grateful it\u2019s all \u201cwater under the bridge\u201d for you. I wouldn\u2019t wish this on anyone. But I\u2019m drowning while your water is now still.\n\nFeeling so small and weak. Doing a lot of self blame.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I was hoping for by reaching out. It was an idiot thing to do. I don\u2019t want her to apologize, for she has nothing to apologize for. We were kids, and kids don\u2019t know any better. I don\u2019t want to make her feel bad either, so I\u2019m not about to be like, \u201cwell good for you, but you it deeply traumatized me...\u201d\n\nDoes it get better? And how? What do I do? Is this just how it\u2019s going to be for the rest of my life? I already have such little value on my life. I just can\u2019t."

The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister\u2019s house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again.\nThen she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her.\nOnce I got there everything was fine again. \u00a0She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn\u2019t love me anymore and had no feelings for me.\nThe only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant.

It is important to have a friend or two. Try to find someone with similar interests. Maybe you can do things that don't involve a lot of face to face contact, like going to see a movie, play or sporting event. Many people are perfectly happy doing things in small groups. If you have ongoing conversations in your head, it is usually due to worry about being judged, and wanting to do or say the exact right thing, as mentioned above. Finding someone to talk to, either a supportive friend or therapist, would allow you to get some of those thoughts our of your head, and realize that you are more accepted than you think. Good luck!"

I don\u2019t want to get into details too much (it triggers me), but it was a lot of the usual stuff (my father and his side of the family blame my mom and myself for the lack of relationship with them when they\u2019ve never tried to have one at all, I can never do anything right, etc...). This also led to her talking to some people who are pretty important to me and getting them successfully on her side. \n\nNone of this came with any threat of harm, the most she did was grab me (literally) and pull me into a hug. But I have depression, anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, and ocd and just her cornering me sent everything off the walls. I was suicidal that night, numerous panic attacks, etc... lots of fun.\n\nI don\u2019t know if any of this would be enough to trigger ptsd or not, but I feel like I have it(??)\n\nI keep getting definite flashbacks (mostly auditory, but sometimes it feels like a bad movie I can\u2019t turn off) (these also come with terrible headaches), I dissociate bad when things that remind me of this whole mess are even brought up, I have been having the worst panic attacks of my life when something that reminds of this is brought up, I\u2019ve been having terrible nightmares related to this, I can\u2019t go or even think about going near where it happened without shutting down, I have changed my number to prevent them from contacting me because they were trying to...

        "text":"I'm back in therapy and it was probably the best decision I could have made. Hello, all. I've been reflecting on the events of 2017, what with it being the new year and all, and I just wanted to share a little of my happiness with everyone. \n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD a few years back because of extended trauma going back from elementary school all the way through to college. When I was diagnosed, I had actually sought out therapy for depression but due to some conversations with friends and the things I was currently studying in my Stress and Trauma class (I was a psych major) I realized that I fit almost every symptom listed for the PTSD diagnosis as well. \n\nI had been receiving therapy through my university's health program which allowed for a certain number of free visits every semester. But then my therapist left the university clinic and went into private practice. I continued to see her, but I couldn't afford the insurance copay and eventually stopped my visits altogether. On paper the fees were reasonable, but all my financial info was based on the fact that I was technically still considered my mom's dependent. In reality, she only paid for my insurance and I was living in poverty while trying to go to school because I was receiving pretty much no help from my family and couldn't find work. \n\nFrom then until just a few months ago, I wasn't receiving any treatment for my mental health issues. Last year was rather hellish for me. I was in a much better situation financially, I lived in a better apartment, had a job, and in a lot of other ways my life was objectively better. But emotionally, I was suffering. It hadn't been that bad for me since I had escaped the awful home life that traumatized me in the first place.\n\nIt took a lot of mental energy in a time where I didn't have much, but at my lowest point I finally researched therapy offices in my area. I got married two years ago and my partner's insurance covers most of the cost. Plus, we're fortunate enough that I can afford it without having to worry about still being able to eat afterwards, unlike when I was in college. So I called and made an appointment. \n\nThat was back in October. I'm now going through CPT (cognitive processing therapy). It's really fucking hard, but so far it has absolutely been worth it. I'm putting a lot more time and effort into improving myself. I've been much more productive. I'm doing things I used to love again. Things that used to seem a distant dream or completely unachievable now feel like they might be things I can tackle - if not now, then *someday*. I'm more hopeful than I've probably ever been. My partner has been unbelievably supportive and has said they're really proud of me for all the work I've been doing. \n\nI'm not quite there, yet. It's still a struggle. But I'm making it. I feel like I can do this. And I hope that all of you reading this can claim some happiness for yourselves, too. \n\nMuch love ~\n\nTL;DR: I have gone untreated for over three years and just got back into therapy a few months ago. Already it's made a big difference and I feel like I'm getting my life back. "

Additionally, I hadn\u2019t been able to sleep for more than three hours at a time for over a month, so I was running on fumes and should have called out.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 response was to get frustrated and discharge me.

My Dad lost his job and my Mum had to work all the time in order to make things work while my Dad had to travel to look for work. I have two older brothers. One went off to school and was dealing with his own suicidal feelings and anxiety. My other brother who is 8 years older than me was living at home (and still is). During that period of time the house was basically his. He was a drug addict. Lied and stole. We constantly had a parade of different people in the house that abused me in some way or another. My brother's abusive girlfriend lived with us. It seemed like it was just me, him, her and whatever person was staying in our basement at the time. They used to beat the crap out of each other. He was abusive emotionally and verbally and I remember mostly just hiding under a desk when I got home and just zoning out or not going home. I was a pretty square kid because I didn't want to be like my brother and got bullied a lot for that and I guess my \"dyke\" vibes or whatever (kids threw rocks at me at school-- kinda biblical).   \n\n\nI put all of these feelings aside for the longest time. And by \"put aisde\" I mean, I didn't deal with them and they caused a lot of problems in my development and relationships. My therapist told me that I have PTSD. I thought other sexual trauma was more responsible but, this was what my therapist always wanted to focus on. That and later my cocaine and alcohol habits when I finally snapped.  \n\n\nNow. My brother only drinks and smokes cigarettes. Lives with my parents and is pretty nice and gets help for his OCD. I do not live with my family. I moved across the country and it proved to pretty much help me to be away from them all. Problem is for me. Right now. Is that my brother has changed. But he teases me for being over sensitive and having a temper with him. He loves to tease me and I get so frustrated that I cry and feel myself since it's the same house wanting to crawl under a desk when he does this.   \n\n\nHow do you tell someone that you recognize that they have changed but, you are unable to forgive them (at least mentally because I know I can never physically forgive him due to my body having a will of its own) and that they can not have that teasing sibling relationship with you because you traumatized me too much. My brother is not a responsible person and is pretty condescending and problematic and we fight constantly....   \n\n\nI don't know what to do but, I am staying here currently until January because I live very far up North (the last town before the next town is a fly in town in the Yukon) and I need to wait for the river to completely freeze to cross it to get home. Wasn't planned. I can feel myself just getting worse. "

DO IT! for the sake of your happiness!!!**\n\n  \nthen refocus on the trauma and see how you feel NOW thinking about the same trauma. \n\n  \nscale on 1-10 again (sometimes you can feel the emotions spiking up it is alright just continue this process.)\n\n  \nsee how you feel thinking about it and do it again\n\n  \nso see the trauma, see how it makes your body react, scale it, put it into your hands, send it to universe, take couple of breath. verify how you feel again.  \nRINSE and repeat.\n\n  \nDid it work for you? if not comment below i'll help you.\n\n  \nRicher Morin"

I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019ve convinced me that sometimes coming out of the house despite being around people you can trust is something to be avoided. So it ends up with me being a homebody a d having to give excuses every time to my friends. I have this fear that if I tell them that its due to my ptsd they\u2019ll think I\u2019m  making excuses. \n\nHas anyone struggled with this and found a way to cope with it?"

For reference, I (21F) developed severe anxiety and depression when I was 19 (which also had some C-PTSD mixed in from being ostracized at school for years growing up), got put on the wrong drugs that made me suicidal, and was sent to a Christian inpatient mental health facility for seven weeks. The things that happened in that place are what really led to the development of full-blown PTSD, and especially as I\u2019ve started therapy and started to fully grasp what happened, I can feel it kind of getting worse.\n\nThe hardest part for me right now is the anger. I used to be such a nice, friendly person who never got mad. Now it\u2019s like any minor inconvenience sends me into full-blown rage. I feel like I can\u2019t control my emotions anymore and I\u2019m really scared that everyone around me will start hating me for it. I hate feeling this way, but I just can\u2019t stop being angry.

I have the same reaction whenever something comes near my head, even when my friend threw a napkin in my direction.  am i valid for feeling this way? i genuinely feel so stupid and emotional for having these reactions even though my psychiatrist told me that\u2019s normal for people with PTSD.  has anyone else felt this way? what should i do about the people that almost scoff at me once i tell them *why* i have PTSD? thank you so much in advance i appreciate it."

I don't like going into details about this but when I was 15\/16 my school friend went missing (we had a very small school, maybe 10 people per class? It was for ppl with mental health problems I had\/have pretty severe depression and anxiety) it was just when we had finished secondary school so lots of us assumed she'd ran away from home. She hadn't and her body parts were later found and her step brother arrested for it.\nAfter this I completely shut myself off from my friends, I didn't even talk to my therapist about it (I was with CAMHS) I didn't let myself be sad about it at all. Now that I'm 20 i feel like everything reminds me of it. I can't watch anything true crime\/murder related without feeling weird and everything remind me of what happened. Even GoT has been a bit much with beheadings etc... And I know I could just avoid watching stuff like that completely but you'd be surprised how often murder comes up in basically any TV show. I can't deal with dissociating everytime I think about it and see something that makes me think about it. I don't know what to do, I'm already on medication for my depression \/anxiety (100mg sertraline). I just feel like I can't talk to anyone about it because not only is it horrible for me people never know what to say.\nAgain sorry if this is the wrong place to put this, all in all I'm just asking if anyone has coping methods for certain triggers I guess?"

I want to backpack Europe but even for that I'd need a good few thousand. \n\nToday, I got fired from my job. I wasn't the best employee but I spoke french and English which most others couldn't and I we had occasional french customers, I was early, I was fast on the cash register, I followed the dress code and didn't stand around talking for 40 mins where most others barely did that... managers included.. \n\nThere were 4 managers and I had no problem with the first 3. The 4th one was a narc that totally triangulated the other 3 against me and I noticed a shift in their attitudes towards me after she decided to have a vendetta against me. She would constantly minimize me, be passive aggressive, push only my breaks back but no one else's and nit pick me to a T. Other employees agreed that they saw this happening. \n\nToday I woke up feeling amazing after a deep sleep meditation on YouTube- only to get fired as they told me right before my shift. This really shook me and made my PTSD worse and I've felt like crap all day today... It was the only thing that helped me build motivation, my job. It's this constant cycle of me barely surviving and then other people tearing me apart. \n\nIve suffered severe attachment traumas.

        "text":"What is wrong with me? Do I have PTSD? Hello,  \n\nI\u2019m a 25 year old woman that turns 26 in exactly two weeks, and I couldn\u2019t fathom being anymore depressed than I am now. When I was 14 and a new sophomore in high school , I met this 22 year old man (I\u2019ll call him The Man) via my friend who was 14 as well. At the time I didn\u2019t know how old he was and he and my friend\u2019s sister (16) were dating. Somehow, the man got my phone number and consistently and persistently texted me until I stopped ignoring him and began texting back. \n\nI didn\u2019t like him at first, but after weeks of texting nonstop, my 14 year old self somehow fell for him. I knew he was involved with my friend\u2019s sister, and it ate me alive, but I also had feelings for him. One day, when my mom wasn\u2019t home, I invited him over for the first time. We met at my neighborhood pool, and we sat in his car and talked in person for about an hour. When it was time for me to leave, he wrestled with me for about 10 mins trying to kiss me, and when I finally submitted, the only thing I could say was that his breath smelled. He left, and we continued to text. \n\nA week later, my friend\u2019s sister (who was in my orchestra class) gave me a note basically cursing me out for \u201ckissing her man\u201d and calling me a fat slut, which hurt because although I\u2019m no where near obese, I\u2019ve always struggled with my weight, and she knew that. I crumpled the paper up and threw it at her telling her that he has been persistently pursuing me. It was a big thing and I almost got kicked out of class. I was really hurt, but I knew I was wrong. I texted him and asked him why he told her, and he said he didn\u2019t want to keep a secret from her, and that he couldn\u2019t see me anymore. I was extremely hurt and didn\u2019t really understand what had happened. He began to ignore me, but would sometimes call me and leave messages about how sorry he was. This all took place around this time this year, the fall. \n\nI fell into a depression, being that this was my first romantic encounter, and it was so negatively toxic, I didn\u2019t know what to think or do. I stopped eating and lost a bunch of weight. Being that I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about this, my family thought I had developed an eating disorder. This lasted a couple months. Then in December, around Christmas break, I started getting prank phone calls. They would call about twice a day, and after about a week, the person came clean and turns out it was The Man.  He told me that he and my friend\u2019s sister ended things because her mom found out about their relationship. He told me that he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. Elated, I told him I loved him too and agreed to being in a relationship with him. \n\nWhen school started back in January, he would come over after school every Wednesday. My single mom worked a lot, and I took advantage of that. We happily \u201cdated\u201d for exactly a month, until one day, he told me that my friend\u2019s sister wanted him back and wanted to work on their relationship. He also told me that while they were dating, they were sexually involved, something that he was not getting from me. He began breaking up with me saying that she was first. I was distraught. I thought that giving him what she could give him, would make him stay with me. While crying, I told him I would have sex with him. He decided to take me up on that offer. I told him I was scared and asked him if it would hurt and he said it would. He laid me down, and told me to open my legs. I was crying and scared, so he forced them open. I don\u2019t remember it actually happening, but I do remember after it happened, he told me to tell him that he broke me. I told him that he broke me, and he left, not changing his mind about ending things. I cried all night. \n\nHe continued to text me, and see me even while dating the sister. We would have sex, and my attachment to him became really deep, scary deep. About 2 months later, I snuck out in the middle of the night to meet him in my neighborhood and I got caught by the police. The police also found him, but let him go. They brought me home and told my mom. She was livid. She told me that she was pressing charges. She called me a slut and a whore and took my phone. I found a way to contact him and told him what was going on. My mom contacted him and wanted to meet up with him. I don\u2019t know what that meeting looked like or how it went but they met, and afterwards, he told me he couldn\u2019t talk to me anymore, and my mom didn\u2019t press charges. \n\nAbout a year later, I received an email from him saying he missed me. Our secret relationship started up again, but this time it was a bit different. His twin brother was dating this 17 year old girl that I went to school with, so naturally, the girl and I became friends to be each other\u2019s cover. We would all hangout together and one time we all were in the same bed and having sex, but not with each other. I met some of his other siblings and had to lie about my age when they said I looked so young. He would also give me alcohol. There was a time that I went on a weekend trip with him and his brother to visit their friend (24). We stayed at the Friend\u2019s house who was celebrating his girlfriend of 6 years\u2019 birthday. It was a big celebration because she was finally turning 18. The Man had friends like him and even his twin brother was like him. About a week later, I found out that he gave me chlamydia and when I told him about it, and that he was the only guy I\u2019ve ever been with, he denied it and said that I must\u2019ve gotten it from a toilet seat or something. Somehow, my entire high school found out that I had an std. I don\u2019t know how, but I continued to date him. On the same date that he broke up with me the year before, he broke up with me again, stating that I was too young. He still continued to see me and have sex with me, just without the title of being in a relationship with me. This allowed him to see other people, which I didn\u2019t understand. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later, my mom found out and this time actually pressed charges. She took me to talk to a detective and I remember hating her for that. I didn\u2019t tell the detective everything but I told him some things and that I loved him. The Man decided to turn himself in and I didn\u2019t talk to him again after that. My mom was extremely mad at me for months. I knew she was disappointed in me, and every chance she got, she let me know. \n\nWhen I started my senior year of high school, things were a lot more normal. My mom was trusting me again, and even got me a car. I had a boyfriend that was my age, that she approved of. One day, at a Friday high school football game, I saw The Man. I was there with my boyfriend and avoided The Man. He stared at me and watched me. When the game ended, he texted me and said that he sees I moved on. I said yeah. \n\nThe case against him was still going on. A few months passed and he contacted me begging me to ask my mom to drop the charges because he was facing 20 years. I told him that I would talk to her. He then asked me to marry him and said that if I marry him, the charges would automatically drop and that he could get us an apartment. He said we could start a family and that he would take care of us. I seriously thought about it, and then declined. I told my mom that he contacted me and she was mad at me. A few months later, I found out that she worked out a deal to bring his sentencing down to him being on probation for 10 years and being on the sex offender\u2019s list for 3 years. \n\nAt the time, my teenage self moved on from the situation very quickly. However when I turned 25 last year, all the memories and emotions I suppressed hit me like a ton of bricks. Ever since I was 16, my body has been sick. I have acne all over my body, irregular periods, mood swings, regular yeast infections and vaginal infections and have had terribly toxic relationships with men. I think that every guy I encounter has given me an STD. For the last two years, and being sexually active once out of those two years, I have been trying to convince myself that I do not have HIV even after testing negatively several times. I\u2019m starting to believe I\u2019m traumatized. \n\n I always feel like I have to please any male I encounter, and that I need to work hard and give him everything I have to avoid him leaving me. I\u2019m overtly sexual and think that I must be a pornstar in order to receive love from the male kind however, I don\u2019t really know what intimacy is. \n\nI don\u2019t have healthy relationships at all. If I befriend a female, after a couple months, I cut her off and stop talking to her. \n\nI have dreams of being a doctor, but now think that I\u2019m incapable of achieving something like that. My confidence is shot, and I hate myself. \n\nI feel guilty for The Man having to spend nearly all of his 20s on probation. I hate myself for being such a fast and loose little girl. I hate what I did to my mom and my sister. \n\nI still live at home, in the same bedroom where all of this took place and it\u2019s starting to swallow me whole. I\u2019ve been having flashbacks of what happened and I hate myself for that.\n\n I don\u2019t know who I am anymore and I\u2019m scared to interact with people or even exist on this planet. Last year, I went to see a naturopath about my skin issues, and she told me that she believes I\u2019m suffering from rape trauma syndrome. I called her a sham and requested all my money back, because I don\u2019t believe I was raped. I made all of that happen, it was my fault. \n\nIm in constant mental and emotional pain, sometimes my mind will checkout for a few days, other times I cope by taking lots of sleeping pills which get me high. Sometimes, I\u2019ll just burst into tears for no reason at all. I\u2019ve sought out therapist and they say that I need to heal from when my dad left me, my mom, and my sister when we were really little. When they tell me that, I find some reason to cut them off, and stop seeing them for this reason, and because I can\u2019t afford it. Now, I just stay at home hoping that no one sees my face. Lately I\u2019ve looked in the mirror and hate what I see. I\u2019m ugly, fat, and undesirable which is why I\u2019m always alone and always will be. I\u2019m scared and I don\u2019t know what to do."

To the point that every year I dread my birthday. Today I\u2019m 19\n\nSchool has been over for some weeks so I\u2019m spending today as I have every day sitting around the house doing absolutely nothing except crying a little more and being more depressed.

        "text":"What you are describing is something psychologists have termed \"triangulation\" which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead.  You have been \"triangulated\" by your wife and mother. This is often seen in families.  It's seen everywhere.  How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn't go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential.  For example, I bet it's easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint. I'm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing.  Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree.  That's what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else's perspective can help you see the issue clearer.  However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem.  You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love. If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences.  Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up.  Even if they really don't like each other and can't get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. \u00a0Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior.  It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other.  These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it.  Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife.  I heard one mother-in-law describe her son's wife as the gateway to her son.  The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son.  The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren.  If your wife doesn't like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law's relationship with you and any children you two may have.  From your wife's viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to."

If you are driving long distances on a regular basis, you want to make sure that your body is in a comfortable position. Second, select some music or podcasts that work for you, rather than against you. Soothing music is good, as well as inspirational podcasts. Alternatively, listening to books can be a great way to spend the time, improve your mood, and find inspiration. Third, make sure that you have plenty of time for your commute. If the drive normally takes you 30 minutes, plan on 45 (or if it's 45 minutes, plan on an hour). This way you won't be rushed, can take your time, can focus on your driving, and if traffic is a bit backed up, you've got plenty of time to reach your destination.Finally, if you do find yourself being anxious in a way that impedes your driving, pull over to the side of the road, take some deep breaths, and sit with your feelings. Take a deep drink of water. Consider jotting your feelings down in a journal. If its safe, get out of the car and walk around a bit, stretching you muscles and breathing in the air.But most of all, be kind to yourself. I wish you much success in your new job."

Some of the PTSD is r\/t a bad car accident I was in and the other part was childhood trauma (not getting into that now). Just started therapy a few months ago for the first time after really bad depression, dissociation, and day\/nocturnal panic attacks and flashbacks.  \n\nAs the title says, heading back from work and I got pulled over on the highway. Officer said I was speeding. I've been dissociating (nightmares\/lack of sleep\/stress from PTSD) more frequently and have no clue what happened before that time.\n\nAnyways, officer walks up to my passenger side and I started to hyperventilate, shake uncontrollably and cry. So bad that I couldn't even form sentences or pull out my wallet. I have the say, I got lucky with the most understanding cop (not enough to get out of the ticket). Not only did he wait patiently, but he kept asking if he could do anything to help. If he could call anyone, get me an ambulance, do anything, etc. I managed to tell him in the midst of it all that I have PTSD and panic disorder and I was having a panic attack. He kept telling me it was okay and to take my time. \n\nHonestly, I dont know what I would have done had he been a douchebag because I literally could not control myself and I felt like the panic attack would have been way worse than it was. I kept having bad flashbacks while he was back in his car (from the cause of my PTSD) and was still basically hyperventilating when he came back. I felt so stupid the whole time because I couldn't calm myself the f down, but having him say \"it's okay, just breathe,\" was really helpful in the moment. \n\nTook a while to actually start driving again and semi process that but I guess I just felt like I needed to share this to people who might get it? Idk. It's frustrating losing chunks in my day, especially for something like this. I'm still feeling \"off\" even though that was an hour ago. Kinda glad I have a therapy session at 1. How do you move forward with your day after a bad panic attack or flashback?"

What happened is I asked out this girl and she rejected me. But the real trouble started when I tried talking to her. She basically bullied me and I fainted right in front of her beside her friend. I feel so fucking embarrassed from that day on because I had to see her face over and over for the next two years reminding me of that event before she graduated from high school AND she babied me like I was fucking stupid. It was insanely awkward at one of my schools ceremonies because she ran the whole thing and I was called up and I had the worst anxiety I\u2019ve ever felt.

This left me feeling betrayed and with no confidence in myself because of her lack of explanation. Fast forward a couple months later, I foolishly filled the void with a girl who I wasn\u2019t into at all, setting me up for another breakup because it was doomed to fail from the beginning.\n\nLater, in February of 2019, was the most significant moment of my life. I was stressed beyond anything I had ever experienced at the time. I was juggling classes that were very hard, mentally preparing myself to move across the country for medical school, and bringing myself to be able to break up with the girl I was dating because I knew I didn\u2019t want her following me. I was cramming for a practical the next day and I noticed my groin was numb, and I looked it up and that\u2019s a sign of heart problems (which I was paranoid of because I have palpitations). My heart was already pounding from lots of coffee consumption and stress, so I called my mom (a nurse) to tell her and ask her if I should be worried, but when I was on the phone with her I had what I would describe as an extremely severe panic attack, which was also my first panic attack, so I had no idea what was going on. I was crying and saying bye to my mom as my heart felt like it was leaping out of my chest and I was making peace with the fact that I was goin going to die (in my head at least). I remember thinking that I was scared to die and leave my family, and I was praying that they be taken care of when I was gone. \n\nI went to the ER, they said it was a panic attack and I shouldn\u2019t be worried. I tried not to be worried, but I was left with a baseline anxiety level that made life extremely difficult. I would question myself and wonder why I couldn\u2019t just learn my lesson and move on, but as the months pass by I am only becoming more dissociated and feel as if I\u2019m watching my life in third person. Anything related to my panic attack (seeing the girl I was going to leave, applying for jobs or school, talking about what I want to do with my life) brings a sense of panic where I can\u2019t articulate my words. Negative thoughts related to these things constantly possess my mind, to the point where suicidal thoughts enter my mind because the pain of not being able to simply relax and enjoy my day as I used to be able to, or put myself out there to get a job or go back to school is maddening.\n\nIf anyone could elaborate on my experience and let me know if it\u2019s relatable or sounds like PTSD I\u2019d be really happy to talk with you about it. I begin therapy Monday and will soon have my medication tuned in. I\u2019m just happy I was brave enough to fight this head on and endure the mental anguish that comes with it."

Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker. \n\nSo, I have\/had a friend that was very supportive and understanding and really helpful in the past. I absolutely honor what he did for me. \nBut a while ago, he was less and less understanding, to a point where I felt he defended my abusers by making excuses for them. For context, for a few years I was kept in hospitals that did a lot of harmful and highly unethical \"treatment\" and I couldn't get out of it, I had no chance to get out of there. When that started, I was already slightly traumatized by events before, and the longer I was kept in hospital, the more suicidal I got. It was absolute horror for me and ever since I am terrified by doctors. \nHe told me things like \"they surely had their reasons for that\" or \"oh, people simply make mistakes\". Especially the \"they had reasons for that\" really really hurt me. \n\nI then decided to talk to him an tell him, that it hurts when he does that, and ask him if he either could stop talking like that or that we might not talk about this topic at all. He apologized that he made me feel that way, but that we just have different opinions on parts of this. Now, this is the point where I probably got unfair. His girlfriend was sexually abused, and I am really really sorry that has happened to her.  What I shouldn't have done, but did, was asking him directly if he would tell her, that the guy surely had his reasons for that or just made a mistake. I know he is very emotionally involved and takes her pain as well and hates that asshole. It was unfair to compare it and remind him of that pain and hate. My trauma isn't that obvious, and I absolutely don't want to compare it. Whatever reason caused it, is valid, and the outcome is equally bad. Absolutely no discussion on this. But I felt like he didn't take me that serious because they were medical professionals who just made some mistakes. I apologized for what I said to him, but got no more answers.

        "text":"I am a college student and I think I have PTSD after a police raid in my apartment. Help Long story, but read if you can. \n\nI came to school last august for the start of my sophomore semester. I chose random roommates and got paired with 2 other individuals who I did not know prior. I moved in, got to know them, and they were really nice. \n\nAbout a day or 2 after we moved in to our university apartment, I noticed alot of traffic coming in and out of the apartment. I knew they were selling drugs. We spoke about it and I was completely fine with it. I didnt mind because it didnt effect me directly, and being a college athlete, i spent most of my time away from the dorm and would only come home at night mostly to sleep and eat. \n\nLots of time passed, Halloween, thansgiving break  christmas, and January, feburary. We grew very close and I met lots of different people over that time, and there were no problems. \n\nThe day before spring break, about 3-4 weeks ago, I had come home at around 10pm on a Thursday night from studying for a computer science exam at 8am the next morning. I watched a little TV with them like we usually do and then I went to bed. \n\nI woke up at 6am to loud yelling and screeming coming from just outside my bedroom door. I hear \"COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!! POLICE!! COME OUT OR WE ARE COMING IN!! I had only underwear on at the time so I said \"one sec\" as loudly as i could and I put on a pair of shorts. I opened my room door slowly and stuck my hands out. I had no shirt on, just shorts and i remember it was absolutely freezing and I was shaking. \n\nDuring this time they continued to yell at me to walk forward and I couldnt see anything because they had assault rifles aimed at me (6-7 officers) with bright flashlights, and that is all I could see. My roomates followed closely behind me. I reached the living roo. where all the cops were and they yelled at me to get on the ground or to turn around, I was scared of making any sudden movements, and i was absolutely freezing and shaking. They handcuffed me and put me on the couch and did the same with my roommates. They made the handcuffs extra tight. \n\nThe main guy who was in charge of everything took me into the kicthen and explained what was going on and his confusing with me being there, saying he didnt expect to see me there and was unaware of my presence, he also mentioned that i wasnt on the search warrant.\n\nI explained to him the living situation and he asked me if I knew anything about the drugs. I said I knew nothing and he told me to go sit on the couch. They searched our rooms and the entire apartment and made a huge mess. \n\nAfter the longest hour of my life, I was taken to my room where I was told that i would be let free because my room was clean, and I didnt know anything. They asked me more questions, like if I ever help set up a drug exchange or anything like that. I answered truthfully and they told me I was allowed to shower once they finished searching the bathroom. \n\nI showered and went to my 8am class to take my exam, which I promptly failed and continied with my week. I was depressed. My roomates were taken away and I was left to care for their cat while not being able to get in contact with them. I was alone in that apartment for a couple days until spring break when i got to go home. Over the break I had to relocate and visit the apartment many time to move my stuff to another dorm. I didnt like going back to that place. \n\nSince I have been in and out of depression, have had a difficult time sleeping. Every sound, people walking outside my door at night, the sound of doors opening and closing and the sound of approaching noises keep me up at night. Once when I was at home during my spring break I got a wrong number phone call, and I looked out the window of my house while I was on the phone and i saw a state police car. My heart immediately began racing and my stomach felt sick, no one was there, and after I calmed down I remembered that a state police officer actually lived in .y neighborhood and occasionally parked infront of our house. But I just got a flash back to the yellow letters that read state police on the officers backs during the raid. \n\nIt got a little better when I finally got in contact with my roomates and figured out the situation with their belongings and cat. But things have gotten worse since then. And now its 2am and im on the PTSD section of resdit posting about it for help. I have team lift at 6am and practice at 6pm later today after classes. I dont know what to do. And my new roommate is a long time friend and teammate but he fucking snores so damn loud I want to strangle him. \n\nDo I have PTSD? What can I do? At times I dont even feel like playing the sport I have been playing for 12+ years and am going to college for. I dont feel like pkaying video games that i used to love to play for hours. Homework and focusing in class as well as studying is hard. \n\nI miss my girlfriend alot, but I dont feel like myself. I feel like who i used to be is lost and i am afraid of spiraling into something worse. I have talked to her and she has been there for me through this situation and is being cautious of my emotions and feelings too to help in any way she can. She has experience with anciety and depression and I think she wants me to maybe seel out help. I am going to speak to her about it when we see each other again. She goes to my school too and I see her often. \n\nanything will help. "

The fact that he ever wants to have sex with me or that he looks at porn or has any sexual thought whatsoever absolutely disturbs me.

        "text":"Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. \n\nGoing to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. \n\nI was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.\n\nI dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. \n\nI dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.\n\nHonestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.\n\nI feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. \n\nIt's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. \n\nBut still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. \n\nI'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.\n\nI know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. \n\n**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks. I have a therapist appointment on friday, but a recent appointment with my psychiatrist, where he absently dismissed a diagnosis of PTSD as being 'purely academic' has me nervous about bringing it up with my therapist."

        "text":"I think i cured my violent sexual trauma and \"fetish\" by getting it to happen to me again. Is this possible? Is it sick? Trigger warning I (25M) was sexually abused almost daily as a kid from age 6 to 12, by an older man. I wouldn't call it \"rape\" because he didn't actually force me, he just taught me how to do everything and I never really existed. This led to me, at age 13, to start hanging out with older men who gave me alcohol and weed in exchange for sexual favors, because it just came naturally to me.\n\n\n At 16 I was literally raped, strangled for 2 minutes , by one of these men who gave me shots of alcohol and got me kinda drunk, I wasn't wasted. Before I went to his house, I told him I did NOT want to get effed that night and he agreed and promised. But all of a sudden when I got there, he violently threw me on the ground and did it anyway. I remember his arms were around my neck while he was behind me on the floor, and my eyes were wide open but I couldn't see anything except super bright white light, fading in and out of consciousness. And I had to limp home bleeding after. (He still has 12 more years in prison).\n\n\nI hated it at the time and it hurt alot, but when I turned 17, I started posting online hookup sites (ONLY WHEN I WAS SUPER DRUNK) that I was looking to be \"real raped, choked\" because for some reason it turned me on in my sick brain after that incident when I was 16. I wouldn't post it all the time , just like once every 2 or 3 months , and mostly did it for the messages . The guys I DID infrequently meet were all just really rough, but respected my feelings when I was in pain, even though I didn't want them to.\n\n\n2 weeks ago, I posted on Grindr asking for that again. This guy sent me a car to his house, gave me lots of shots and one line of coke, which I had never done before. He choked me harder than the guy when I was 16 and did more stuff ,, you know ,, and I was literally in so much pain because he was using his whole hand, and I was screaming \"OKAY STOP , PLEASE STOP PLEASE, STOP\" and I was yelling so loud , and so much, and he only stopped when he noticed I was bleeding alot. And I was in so much pain almost crying ,, but I wasn't mad at him.\n\n\nOver the next 2 days I realized that I do NOT want to be raped anymore. I can't go through it again. I feel like I cured myself from that sick fetish, and I feel brand new. It's so weird. I think it worked . Is this crazy???\n\n\nTL;DR -- I (25M) was abused my whole childhood, and violently raped at 16 by a felon , and then I started having fantasies of being raped again when I was 17. I'm not talking about a fetish, I'm talking of a REAL rape. I found someone to do it violently to me again, a few weeks ago,, and I feel like it cured me of that sick \"fetish\". I don't feel so disgusting now for feeling that . Maybe because this time it was my choice? Is this sick? Do you think this cure will last? Thoughts? It's been weeks now , and the thought of being raped now sounds bad to me."

Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital\/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.\n\nI've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs. The problem is that my current primary therapist (seeing her for a year) doesn't believe in diagnoses. She believes I'm able to get past everything that has happened so I can function like a \"normal\" person. She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. \n\nAm I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public\/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? \n\nTL;DR:\nSevere C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled. Am I overreacting or do I need to find a new therapist?"

My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again.  During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with.  But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child. \r\n\r\nThe baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her.  He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away).  He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too.  He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since.  Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can\u2019t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual.

Hmmm...Is it that you don't fight because you don't bring up what's bothering you? Are you avoiding conflict? Many people do. What do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away? As an engaged couple, now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance. Better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real. Or maybe you have spoken to him about it. If so, what happens? Does he listen and help you understand him better? Or does he avoid and reassure you...or maybe dismiss you? This is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together.\u00a0He says \"leave me alone\". That's a pretty bold statement about what he wants. He doesn't seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is, and how close you want to be. Plus, I have to say, those words sound more like what a closed-off fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be!\u00a0Giving him the benefit of the doubt, it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change. But if this is true, he needs to tell you that so you can understand.\u00a0So, I suggest that the fact that when you're together you're \"okay\" is perhaps not the best barometer for how you're doing as a couple. Listen to your gut. I encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are. This may get rockier before it gets better, but until you face what's not working, you won't know who you truly are as a couple. \u00a0When you're engaged, it's a really cool time to see a therapist too...to get some conflict resolution skills down before you're a married couple."

I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn\u2019t want them to feel like me.  It\u2019s one of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you\u2019re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.\n\nTo avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It\u2019s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.\n\nWhat used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I\u2019ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven\u2019t done that since 06\u2019. \n\nAm I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.

In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones."

I've always thought I had something along the lines of PTSD, however I used to associate PTSD with being in the military so I thought I didn't have it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll try to make this short. Ever since I was a kid I have always been incredibly withdrawn when around people. I was okay around immediate family and very close friends, but when around people I didn't have a deep connection with (which was pretty much everyone except for a select few) I would completely shut down. I remember my stomach would get extremely tight and simultaneously my brain felt like it was being shut off. I couldn't find words so I wouldn't talk. From ages 3-15 I went through school only talking if I was forced to (usually by teachers), which resulted in me never saying a word for 95% of the time. I would try to communicate with others by body language (nodding head, shrugging shoulders, etc), because I was unable to talk to them. Even when I wanted to, immense fear would wash over me and I would clam up even more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hated this about myself but for the majority of my school years I couldn't change even though I desperately wanted to. When freshman year started and I was in a new school, I made it my mission to get over this and talk more. I was able to progress slightly for about a year and a half, but halfway through sophomore year I started becoming severely depressed (which lasted throughout the rest of highschool), and I reverted back into my old self. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was told that I was \"just shy as a kid,\" but I know it was something deeper than that. The thing is I don't know why I acted that way.

I'd like to throw in a technique I learned from Randy\r\nRausch (author of\u00a0The Last Lecture)\u00a0called The 3-Step Apology.\r\nI teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize\r\nto someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselves.Yes, when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget\r\nthat there is part of us that just doesn't know how to apologize effectively.\r\nHere goes:Step One: Say what you did and the damage it caused.Step Two: Say you're sorry and accept full\r\nresponsibility (no excuses, no explanation, no defensiveness: \u201cIt was all my\r\nfault.\u201d)Step\r\nThree: Ask what you can do to repair the damage.Step Three is the one many of us didn\u2019t learn growing up. And when\r\nwe add it to an apology, we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light\r\nas it is. Of course, sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone\r\nis offered. So be it, we can\u2019t control this. But if we are apologizing to\r\nourselves, we can. There is always a way to make amends if we put our heart\r\ninto it.\nGive this a try the next time you\u2019re reluctant to let yourself off\r\nthe hook. You might surprise yourself when how benevolent you can be when\r\ninvited."

How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasn't good enough and that I'm no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but don't know if I should."

We decided to try it, and used it for a few other things, but I was really nervous to use it for PTSD. \n\nRight now, I'm exhausted and my eyes feel physically tired, but I feel like today was the first breakthrough I've had in therapy in a very long time. At one point I was crying a lot, something I've never done in session beyond shedding a couple of tears.\n\nIt was difficult but I'm hopeful.

Luckily my sister was able to lock me in my room because she kept trying to lay with me and \"take care of me\" this triggered tons of thoughts of my past abuses and I began having terrible time dealing with it, having nightmares and flashbacks the next couple months. She denied it completely and said it was just me being too drunk. I never black out. I already had a huge breakup that year and isolated myself in a new state with a new job. Xanax was my coping and I got addicted. I'm beginning to understand why all this began surfacing again. Also my ex fiance called me a textbook psychopath so I was beginning to lose who I was anyway. The next year I lost all of myself when I tried to explain a paranoia attack from a past abuse trigger where I thought I was being hunted and tried to kill myself. I got taken very unseriously.

It sounds as if he is thinking that doing so would mean that he is responsible for his friend's well-being, although I can't say that for certain.Would you be willing to have a discussion with your boyfriend where for a few minutes (five minutes or so), you ask him about what made him react that way? During this time, try to listen and ask questions is if you are an investigative reporter and are trying to learn more about his experience. You can also summarize what you are hearing to make sure that you understand it as he does. This does not mean that you have to agree with what you say, but just that you follow. I hear you saying that you think he's being selfish. I'm suggesting that just during this conversation, you ask questions to focus on what he is thinking and feeling.

I've had very brief therapy experience and am not currently in therapy but I'm wondering if I should see someone about the possibility of trauma. Sorry if this is a long one but here we go. \n\nAs a child I had a debilitating chronic illness which came on very suddenly and meant I had to leave school and I became bedbound with a lot of pain and mystery symptoms. 'Suddenly' as in my life changed basically overnight. Took a loooong time to diagnose too. I was never admitted to hospital long term but did an extensive pediatric tour and being a kid, didn't really know what was happening, if I'd ever get better, etc. and became almost totally isolated from all my old friends too. I also saw the effect my illness had on my family which was really rough. I've been depressed since childhood but only sought help at age 20 because as a kid I was scared if any doctors knew cps would take me away (reports of kids with depression + my condition being wrongly perceived as a result of abuse) plus I didn't want to cause more pain to my family... Then the secret had been kept too long to spill I guess. I'd always been an anxious child too. I also don't remember much of my childhood but I don't know if there's an abnormal lack of memories. \n\nI get angry hearing other people with the illness talk about it... I panic and get upset when I think about how I was... The times I've been forced into talking about it\/remembering being ill I get very emotional... No one who I've made friends with after getting better knows about my illness and I plan to keep it that way. But I've only heard of medical trauma in like, kids who had cancer or really serious stuff. I don't know if this is a trauma or I'm just oversensitive? and I feel like I can't even tell how much this is affecting my life if that makes sense because I don't want to think about it. I'm used to being extremely repressed but finding the right snri has made more actual emotions creep back into my life lol.

I get her ready for bed and went back downstairs to finish a game before I shut my PC off. She came right down and hit the back of my head. I stood up and was in shock, she threw her arms up and said \"What are you gonna do, hit me!?\" I grabbed my phone and started to record her for proof. She backed away and hid from the camera. Eventually she started to hit herself, most likely the tics from tourettes. I took the phone out again to record her and she saw me doing this and it triggered her, she took the phone and began attacking me and herself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to get my phone back to call the police but she did a good job keeping me from it, I was yelling and in her face because I was pissed. She kept attacking me and had my phone. This triggered her into a flashback I believe. Her mood completely flipped to a calm person, looked at me and said \"I forgive you if you slap the fucking shit out of me, you fucking pussy\" She then actually slapped herself and then began to choke herself why saying her ex's name. The rest of the story is the same, I eventually get my car keys and run. I get to a friends house to call the cops and meet them back at my house. I get arrested because she claims I attempted to murder her by choking her to death. I got arrested right away and the cops didn't even get my statement or ask me anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My question to you all is How can you make someone aware that an event they thought was real (flashback).. wasn't?** In her mind she thought I was doing these things to her. She had a flashback of her ex beating her. It's been two weeks and she still thinks I did all of that. I cannot contact her due to being arrested so it'll be a while unfortunately. I've attempted to reach out to her family but no response yet. I'm facing 7-10 years in prison with all the charges the cop\/state put on me.

Not one drink (this was not easy at all)\n\nBut I'm struggling now more then I ever have, My PTSD seems worst then I remember it being before I started drinking to manage it. \n\nI'm angry, paranoid, anxious, depressed, and hypervigilant to the point of near exhaustion. I just feel like giving up and going back to drinking. I feel like these feelings will never go away and I can't function like this, I either need relief by using alcohol again or I need to see a doctor. \n\nThe problem is I'm very paranoid of people and their intentions and I do not trust doctors at all, I also am apprehensive about telling them everything (or anything for that matter) because I feel like they won't keep things between us. I can't repeat the things that cause me hurt and pain to myself, Let alone another person who does not understand what I've been though and had to do. \n\nDeep down I do want to get all those things off my chest but I'm afraid to talk about them. I also don't like being stigmatized as crazy or weak because I am a man. I was raised in a very conservative household and I was taught not to cry, show weakness, or talk about trivial things like how I'm feeling or how things make me feel so talking about feelings is very alien to me. I just don't know if I can tell someone I don't know or trust everything.\n\nI've considered just going to a psychiatrist instead of a therapist so I don't have to talk about anything. \n\nI just want relief from these feelings. \n\nIf anyone has combat induced PTSD, Can you give me advice on what medications to ask for?\n\nAny advice would be great.\n\nThank you"

I managed to work a couple of days a week for a few weeks until one day I was asked to do a job at heights. I took one look down the ladder I was supposed to go down and instantly had a panic attack. I went home that day and haven't been back to work since\n\nI've spent the last year working with an occupational therapist to do exposure therapy for the crippling fear of heights I developed and a counselor weekly for all the other horrible things I've been feeling\n\nTomorrow I go back to a work site for the first time since my panic attack and I'm scared. It's not the site of the accident, thankfully I never have to go back there again, but it's the same industry all the same. I'm only going for exposure therapy purposes so I'll be there for 2 hours tomorrow.\n\n I know I'm going to be safe but I also know I'm going to have an increase in all my symptoms. Conquering my fear of heights has been the most challenging experience of my life. Exposing myself to a fear over and over left me raw and filled with anxiety. \n\nI just had a few weeks break over Christmas and I finally feel like I'm managing my symptoms. I'm terrified of the flashbacks, anxiety, anger, irritability and all the other things I know that are going to get bad again until I master this fear as well. I'm scared of the looks my coworkers in this macho industry are going to give me and the gossip about me that's going to happen for being gone so long and for needing to do therapy at the workplace. I know I shouldn't feel this way but I'm deeply embarrassed to be doing exposure therapy at work. \n\nIf you read all of this thank you. I'm scared and just needed to write this. Advice or thoughts are always welcome"

I feel like i cant talk about my trauma, because i don't even know if it actually happened, or if my mind just made it up.\n\nI've had a ridiculously high sex drive since late middle school for seemingly no reason, i was obsessed and so lost in fantasies (nothing immoral) that my grades fell. Im trans and poly, like so aggressively poly i have trouble with monogamous relationships. I have diagnosed chemical depression and general anxiety disorders but i thought it was common, especially in high school. I went to therapy but they would always try to figure out \"the real reason\" i was depressed, as though my litte sister passing wasn't enough. I attempted suicide several times, but nobody knew.\n\nI had a sexual relationship with an ex my sophomore year. A few months after we started having sex, i started dissociating and having flashbacks of things i didn't remember, followed by panic attacks. I had had lots of negative sexual encounters (like regret or harassment; i often got my ass slapped in middle school hallways and thought it was a good thing until i was older) which, sadly, lots of afab people do, but i didn't remember any assault. \n\nI still have the flashbacks, though not as often or aggressively. Some positions or certain phrases trigger it, sometimes it's just the act, sometimes it's because someone angrily kicked their backpack in the hall or raised their voice. I usually have to stop whatever sexual thing I'm doing and often don't do anything else sex-wise for several days, but i can occasionally force it out of my head and continue. I still have an elevated sex drive but not as crazy as before i started getting them. I still have problems with monogamy.\n\nI wonder if the sex drive and my being trans and poly were defense mechanisms, like subconsciously trying to retake control of my body. I guess I'll never really know. I've tried to tell therapists and counselors, but i can't ever spit it out because i feel like they'll tell me repressed memories are a myth or I'm doing it for attention and i just don't know what to do. My ex broke up with me partly because of it. I hate sex now but i love it and i can't just quit. I'm so tired and conflicted and i don't know what to do.\n\nSorry for the rant."

Long time reader but first time posting things.\n\nI never took counseling until now. In the past I used to work at two nursing home facilities and three restaurants but none of those workplaces never appeal to me, or you know never led me to consider thinking of taking counseling which is what I meant. Until on December 7th, 2017, my first day of orientation I was hired for a job at a nursing home where the backdrop view is phenomenal, it was like a valley along the canal and behind the fenced canal was someone's houses that looked like treehouses. Then there was a black cat and her third batch of kittens. Her first two batch of kittens were eaten by coyotes. \n\nYeah we have a lot of coyotes around here. While coyotes were roaming around the small town, the third batch of kittens were taken to an animal shelter by a homeless woman. And they were taken to a better place the day before Christmas so that way they won't be fated to die by coyotes like the previous batch. I feel like me and the cat have something in common. Maybe she has ptsd - I don't really know. \n\nI don't want to sound evangelical but I feel like God had given me a second chance after I quit from the past nursing home. Well enough about the past job where I used to work.\n\nI got an interview from this job while I was at another hospital which shared the same company. I didn't like the hospital where I was because the interviewer didn't tell me on the phone that he was sick and he wasn't going to show up. That was a red flag. One minute later........a woman called me on the phone and said she is a dietary supervisor from another hospital that shared the same company. \n\nThe next day I was there and was greeted by a young woman. She is the same age as my older sister. And everything went downhill from there when my childhood bully is working there as well. She doesn't even remember who I am. I remember who she is. I yelled at her and I got a warning then I couldn't keep my emotion in check because there this short woman in the kitchen with Napoleon complex who is so manipulative. I didn't want to report her at first because the administrator is always so busy and I was just being considerate but instead I got shafted because I made an emotional outburst and she reported me to him. I told him everything but that was the last strike unfortunately. \n\nWell anyway I got discharged yesterday and I'm just writing this so I could make a progress report and see how much improvement I made because hopefully, in ninety days I could probably return to the hospital if the job is still available. I don't know. I hope so. I really like the job. I really like drawing caricature of my dietary supervisor in funny scenarios. But I guess nothing will ever last forever.  \n\nThe CNAs and the LVNs are really cool and hardworking. The administrator is nice but he has to abide with the law so I don't really blame him for having to discharge me like that. My dietary supervisor hated to see me go but I guess it was her first time being forced into the situation where she had to dismiss someone from the job. "

PTSD, after all, is an invisible condition. We fight the battle ourselves, unable to share what happened. The result is self-imposed isolation and a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Some days are much easier than others. One thing I found helpful to me is keeping an active mind. The more occupied my mind, the less space there is for my trauma to rent in my head.\n\nIn the constant effort to keep my mind stimulated, I have found myself doing some pretty interesting things. Some have led to joy, some have led to pain.

        "text":"Six years mostly stable. Backsliding for no apparent reason. I know it happens. Mostly a vent post. No one needs to fucking read this, the TL;DR is the title. I'm just starting to get this millenial thing where posting it here is mildly more comforting than journaling for inexplicable reasons.\n\nLike I said, 6 years managing life pretty \"normally\" since leaving inpatient care after I had reached a nonfunctional point (PTSD is not my only mental illness). I have been in ongoing therapy and taking my meds. It's been up and down but I've rebuilt a full life that moves forward and remained functional to the degree that institutionalization hasn't been thought of again.\n\nBut then really the last 2.5 years or so something snapped in place and I got my symptoms under control in a way I never had before (therapy, consistent medication, and meditation). I've cut down on panic attacks like I never thought possible and largely eliminated most of my behaviors that scream from across the room \"that dude has anxiety!\". I've been moving past triggers with nothing but a blip in my blood pressure and a few moments of breathing. I've read entire books sitting with my back to an open bay window and completed meals at a leisurely pace in bustling open air restaurants. I've been so fucking proud of myself. I've researched and discussed in therapy and try, in a healthy way, to never let myself forget that I'm never \"cured\" and I understand that. \n\nBut I had started to think about thinking about feeling that I could someday live in daily confidence I was done with relapses. You know.... just kinda live. How people do. [They do, right?]\n\nThen two weeks ago, an accidental touch, fuck, an random ass brush, in the small of my back in a crowded bar launched a full on panic attack (made it to private bathroom to have it out, SO who knows it all was there and drove me home, could have been worse). There have been no life triggers for relapse. This is exactly the kind of trigger I've been handling. But this touch broke a dam somehow. In the last two weeks I've reacted to a host of my classic triggers so noticeably that coworkers and acquaintances and strangers are asking if I'm ok, and circle of friends who know what's wrong are exchanging looks and starting to prepare contingency plans for me in social outings again. It's spiraling so fast and I know part of the reason is that I'm feeding it by panicking about it, but how the fuck do you not do that? \n\nI ended up nonfunctional before not just because of the severity of my issues but because I have a lot of \"daily life\" triggers. I'm in hospitality management, low levels of \"normal\" and friendly touching- without warning, I'm ok with handshakes- are basically constant. If I continue to slip at this pace back to where I was 6 years ago I unquestionably cannot keep my job as is.\n\nI can't even cook this week- one of my biggest things that had been so much more than a hobby and so healing it doesn't even make sense- because standing at the stove in our kitchen means you have your back to a door. [New apartment, we moved in last year and I said the door situation would be fine because it's a door exclusively to our own gated backyard, at the time I was OK enough for that knowledge to override the problem and I thought it was a good idea, immersion therapy wise or some shit.]\n\nLike I said I know this isn't how it works but I'm so mad at myself that there's no *cause* for this. I've felt validated (enough) in the past for back slides after difficult life events and literal triggers like wrapping up legal and practical issues relating to my trauma. But everything is going fucking great lately. It just feels like my brain said \"pushing 3 years feeling safe? Long enough buddy!\" and shut that shit down because I don't deserve it. \n\nI know this can be gotten back under control. Therapy is once a month now, I haven't been back since this started but it's next week. I know it will help. I remember this hopelessness before and I can still remember the difference after letting treatment work. \n\n I just feel like I either failed, or somewhere deep in my subconscious, gave up. I can't help but wonder if I subconsciously shut down whatever autonomic part of me has been constantly keeping vigilance because I want to be the old me again, and wallow in it because getting better is so exhausting, and affects my loved ones daily while me just being locked up lets them fucking live. [The fact that I have this pathetic narcissistic tendency is the other reason I ended up nonfunctional before, I'm aware of it. I leaned in back then and that weakness is always there.]\n\nThat's all. Hope y'all out there are doing better."

I then broke it two more times in the span of six months. The third time was a surgery where they had to break it and pin\/plate it together after a malunion. \n\nEver since surgery I\u2019ve had several severe nightmares. Lately they\u2019ve become a nightly occurrence. I feel the pain all over again, and I wake up crying\/in a panic. Anytime I hear a plane flying I get very nauseous and I feel like I\u2019m gonna pass out. A plane had caused my horse to panic and they threw me off, causing the initial break. The thought of even getting on a horse again is impossible, but I was raised around them. When I see my scar from surgery (the doctor left my staples in too long and my skin grew over some of them, causing more scarring), I feel very very upset. I can\u2019t wear tank tops anymore because I just can\u2019t stand seeing it. I haven\u2019t told my therapist about this (I\u2019m in therapy for other mental issues) because this all feels silly. \n\nFour of the eight therapists I\u2019ve been to have mentioned that they want me to get tested or whatever for ptsd because of other things that have happened in my life.

        "text":"I have PTSD because of a volitile relationship It's a very long story and it's pretty dark. But here goes. I was with this girl for three years and we had a house together, pets, you name it. Well we started fighting a lot and she had self harm issues. Our fights would start out small and next thing you know, we were screaming in the house, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg. She would lock herself in a room and try to cut herself in the middle of these fights, so I would break into the room to stop her (my mind immediately shifting to I'm not fighting with her anymore, I'm going to try and stop her and show her I love her), but she never let up. She would resort to brutally beating me in the face to get me away from her and say the most horrible things to me. She would tell me I was a loser, I was ugly, fat, and all sorts of things that I refuse to remember. I would try to leave and blow off the steam and she would force her way in front of me and threaten me that she was going to kill herself or that we're done if I leave. And we had the cops called on us three times, because we were so loud. I lied when they said was anyone hurt, as I sat there with a developing black eye and her sitting there with her cuts. I lied to my friends and said that I got my black eye from work. I remember one time specifically was at AWA, and all of my friends that were there, surrounded me and wouldn't leave me alone about my black eye, which wasn't the first one. I lied to them again and then I told them I had to pee, and went to the bathroom and cried really hard. Fast forward to the end, a couple of years ago. I had a concussion at work. I fell into a running compactor and hit my head, and my boss saved my life. I completely forgot the previous two months, including my sister getting engaged and everything. They wouldn't let me drive or watch movies or anything until I recovered. It was a nightmare. Well I started getting my memory back and she started a fight with me because my friend was coming to see me and she \"wanted to do her workout.\" it escaladed very quickly to the same routine as before only this time I broke a statue that we got together and I threw the flowers I got her on the floor and the cops were called again and said one of us had to leave for the night. She kicked me out and broke up with me and never let me come back. I couldn't drive at the time she made me stay outside until my mom came and got me. I begged her not to do it, because I was in love with her despite everything and she treated me like a criminal and condemned me. She tried to turn all of my friends against me (which failed horribly for the most part) and told everyone that I was the one abusing her. I never touched her like that and I never said anything so horrible to her. I treated her like gold 95% of the time and I cared about her more than anything. I left her a long letter on the porch a week after all of this, explaining how much she meant to me and that I wanted a new start with her and she called the cops to tell me to leave her alone and told everyone that I was a psycho. It keeps coming back to haunt me every so often, how do I cope? "

My parents are the only people that know about my habit.\n\nThe thing is, I use it sort of medicinally.\n\nBackground: I suffer from PTSD and psychotic symptoms. I see and hear things constantly that are highly frightening and distracting. I am resistant to medicines in that none have worked so far. My treatment is unsuccessful. I'm at a point in my life where I am thrown between therapists because they have straight up said that they do not know how to help me.\n\nI tried nicotine first for the risk. I liked feeling kind of rebellious I will admit. I wanted to mess with my brain a little and play around with it. When I started to use it, it relaxed my brain in such away that it began alleviating psychotic symptoms. Nicotine is a mind altering drug and it is not impossible for it to mess with your head. I do not have a clear cut explanation for how it works. Anyway, it slowed and lessened the effects of my psychotic symptoms.\n\nI know that what I am doing is unhealthy. I know that I could be harming the vaping community. For that, I feel terrible. At the same time, is it so wrong to be using it if it helps me more than anything? I am sacrificing having an addiction for my mental health. I believe I'm in a moral grey area because I am harming but also helping myself. Is it so bad for me to self medicate when I have stressed other options?\n\nObviously I am still pursuing therapy and psychiatric help.

However, in the past two years, I think I've pinpointed that my emotional issues stem from a specific incidence of trauma from when I was a kid, but I'm doubting if this memory was actually 'traumatic enough'. \n\nWhen I was around 7 years old, I had a pet parakeet. My older brother, around 14 at the time, offered me a quarter if he could have my her. In my mind, since we lived in the same house, he could have the bird but she would still be here in the house, so it didnt matter. I don't remember much of the events that happened after that moment, but I remember that he had had a friend over and they were joking around. Anyways, we had the kind of glass windows that shut closed. At some point, my brother put the bird in the windowsill and smashed the glass slider against her, basically killing her violently. \n\nI believe I suppressed this memory, or blocked out most of it, since I don't remember much of what happened afterwards. \n\nI'm making this post because I have told only one person in my life about this situation, and while she is incredibly supportive and helpful with my emotional issues, I still feel in the back of my mind that this \/isn't\/ PTSD, and my issues don't stem from this experience at all. \n\nFor the entirety of my life, I have felt an extreme, often paranoid fear of people close to me hurting me physically or even killing me. I am currently seeing a wonderful guy, but I feel like I have PTSD glasses on and am searching obsessively for signs that he's a sociopath. This obsessive fear, of someone close to me turning out to be a sociopath\/someone who will violently hurt me, has been a ever present theme in my life, and I am wondering if this worry is directly caused by the experience with the bird, or if it's coming from something else.

But I need to get this off my chest before I do anything further. Now here we go again, what brings me close to suicide:\nAround 2 months ago my girlfriend I was together with for like half a year broke up with me. But it wasn't the \"cool way\". I caught her cheating, and then she broke up with me. I told her if she is sorry and wont do it again we can still be together and that I really love her and would forgive her. That time I was so attached to her, I dont understand it anymore today but thats how things used to be. She just refused and left. Out of nothing... I suffer from PTSD and paranoia, she was there for me in my baddest times. I was dumb for even staying with her. She was never serious, a total fraud. I dont know why she even stayed with me one second... It took me some time and I'm not done processing it yet, but it gets better. Back then I also had an reddit account and gained a lot of support and help which I'm very thankful for. Smoking weed also helps me a lot. It helps me calm down, I'm full with high tense energy all the time and its hard for me to get clear thoughts and I'm very shaky. I usually get the weed from a \"friend\" who was out of town for 3 weeks. The PTSD got worse, and I know weed would be my savior. Without searching for it I found a profile on twitter, yes twitter, from a guy I've known for a long time, not actually in real life but have seen his profile couple of times. It was his personal page where he has real life stuff etc and makes let's plays. And he had a post where he said he is selling weed, you just needed to dm him. The dumb addict I am I would give it a try. I would never buy it that way usually, but I was in a dark hole and didnt had anything on me and my dealer wasnt available ,so I thought okay this guy seems cool whatever cant be that bad and I mean its just weed not heroin or meth. A virtual friend showed me his profile some time ago so he must be cool. I wrote him a dm. He answered pretty fast and I bought weed worth 50$ from him. I let him convince me to pay with a amazon gift card. I'm an idiot I know. But my post traumatic stress was so bad I just said fuck it, he has a lot of real life stuff on his page why would he scam someone over 50$? So I paid, send him the code and gave him my adress. All of that with my REAL LIFE twitter account I wasnt even active anymore at that time but still had a lot of old posts. Couple days later a friend of mine offered me to go watch a movie, I refused and stayed home just to receive my package. It never came and I wasted much time waiting for it... After I didnt receive it after 1 week I asked him a couple of times what happened still fully in trust and believing he was legit. After asking and asking over and over he finally blocked me and I realized I got scammed. I did some research on him and found out he was scamming people on the regular. Sometimes even doxing them, threatening them and stuff like that, when they wanted to go to the police. dont know if you can even call this a person, he is a monster in my opinion.  he also is into cyber bullying. His followers\/friends are terrorizing people online. it seems like they do it just for fun Or because their lifes are bad they thing they need to make others bad as well.... I was shocked I couldnt believe what I got myself into. This person has my adress, knows how I look, knows a lot probably since I contacted him with my main twitter. I dont want to and cant go to the police because then I will get fucked for \"buying\" weed. I could seriously lose my job here. I wish so bad I could go back in time... I dont know what that guy is going to do with my infos, but I know I'm in real trouble. I know there is no reason but if he wanted to he could fuck my life up. Just because I was stupid, didnt pay enough attention for one single moment. I felt so bad  I needed the weed, but all for what? I fucking have paranoia but still trusted him. I feel worthless. I just didnt wanted any problems. I was always nice to everybody. Helped others. Went to the shop buying 50$ worth of amazon without even questioning it. I dont wanted to get PTSD, I didnt ask for it. I didnt want to get a whore as a girlfriend who leaves me back in the dirt. Tbh atm I dont even want to life anymore. As if thats not enough I'm also now wasting peoples time on reddit with this long ass Text.When I think of this bastard having a good time with the money I had to work hard for I'm so full of hate. if they or he would read this he'd probably laugh at me for being a pussy and crying on reddit for help. Wants to see me suffer or whatsoever... My reaction seems a bit harsh, I know, but it's really boiling over right now. I'm not a bad person I always tried to get everything right to be a good person and what do I get? Finger up my butthole, every single fucking time. I finna need to stand up for myself, do something bout it.. I can't life in peace anyway. Other people dont want me to. The state making weed illegal dont want me to. My ex gf dont want me to. My boss who is paying me minimum wage dont want me to. Why scum like that even has to exist? My ankles are bleeding, because I punched the fucking wall. Is this what they want? That I become an total asshole like they all are? Okay they can get it.... I just cant go on with my life like this, I've been at this point thousand times , where I was 100% it wont happen again,but it happened again and again. People shitting on me. In real life and since recently even online. In a world fucked up like this with PTSD and paranoia I simply cant survive being the person I am right now. Dont know if hate\/revenge is the answer. I dont want to go to jail, but I mean my life gets more fucked up everyday. Before I die by cancer (yes I have cancer, its no joke.  I'm psychologically and physically very ill), something needs to change. I just want to be happy. But I'm miles away.\nI wish no human being has to experience this feelings. Where my life is so bad now I realized that there were always people like me before, right now there are so many humans crying, at the edge of suicide, (every half minute someone kills himself!!), feeling helpless and being treated not fair, it really makes me sad. I dont see any of it but I know for a fact its there ..."

I have four months\u2019 holiday, and we don\u2019t go back until October, but I\u2019m worried about making progress with healing and then seeing her - I think it would be a lot better for me never to have to see her again, if I\u2019m honest. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, I feel like I\u2019m trapped and no one understands."

My work days last ten hours but I\u2019m gone from home for twelve. I can\u2019t have my phone on me, can\u2019t listen to music, can\u2019t be in the bathroom long (also have IBS) because I\u2019m timed and can get in trouble for being off task.

I am off Thursday-Saturday and Saturday night, I had the most vivid flashbacks ever. I became paralyzed and had insomnia. I decided I needed to not be at work for a few hours, so I went in late. I became dizzy at my station yesterday and had to go home early...same as today. I feel so weak. Powerless. I know how I must look to other people. It kills me that my peers laugh, joke, and talk throughout our shifts and don\u2019t get in trouble for it or not making their rate, but I have had a conversation about how many bathroom trips I make. I broke down in tears last week because I was triggered by one of these rude\/loud beings. I kept crying after I thought I was okay because at that point, I was just embarrassed. I feel so bad for my boyfriend because he has to provide so much emotional support TO me...on a daily basis. I don\u2019t have friends. My family doesn\u2019t understand.

My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious\u2014they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.\r\n\r\nOne day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him. They also say I'm living a separate life at home than I am at school. They say they want what's best for me and love me because they adopted me."

        "text":"I'm back in therapy and it was probably the best decision I could have made. Hello, all. I've been reflecting on the events of 2017, what with it being the new year and all, and I just wanted to share a little of my happiness with everyone. \n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD a few years back because of extended trauma going back from elementary school all the way through to college. When I was diagnosed, I had actually sought out therapy for depression but due to some conversations with friends and the things I was currently studying in my Stress and Trauma class (I was a psych major) I realized that I fit almost every symptom listed for the PTSD diagnosis as well. \n\nI had been receiving therapy through my university's health program which allowed for a certain number of free visits every semester. But then my therapist left the university clinic and went into private practice. I continued to see her, but I couldn't afford the insurance copay and eventually stopped my visits altogether. On paper the fees were reasonable, but all my financial info was based on the fact that I was technically still considered my mom's dependent. In reality, she only paid for my insurance and I was living in poverty while trying to go to school because I was receiving pretty much no help from my family and couldn't find work. \n\nFrom then until just a few months ago, I wasn't receiving any treatment for my mental health issues. Last year was rather hellish for me. I was in a much better situation financially, I lived in a better apartment, had a job, and in a lot of other ways my life was objectively better. But emotionally, I was suffering. It hadn't been that bad for me since I had escaped the awful home life that traumatized me in the first place.\n\nIt took a lot of mental energy in a time where I didn't have much, but at my lowest point I finally researched therapy offices in my area. I got married two years ago and my partner's insurance covers most of the cost. Plus, we're fortunate enough that I can afford it without having to worry about still being able to eat afterwards, unlike when I was in college. So I called and made an appointment. \n\nThat was back in October. I'm now going through CPT (cognitive processing therapy). It's really fucking hard, but so far it has absolutely been worth it. I'm putting a lot more time and effort into improving myself. I've been much more productive. I'm doing things I used to love again. Things that used to seem a distant dream or completely unachievable now feel like they might be things I can tackle - if not now, then *someday*. I'm more hopeful than I've probably ever been. My partner has been unbelievably supportive and has said they're really proud of me for all the work I've been doing. \n\nI'm not quite there, yet. It's still a struggle. But I'm making it. I feel like I can do this. And I hope that all of you reading this can claim some happiness for yourselves, too. \n\nMuch love ~\n\nTL;DR: I have gone untreated for over three years and just got back into therapy a few months ago. Already it's made a big difference and I feel like I'm getting my life back. "

Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or \"go see a therapist\" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.\n\nOkay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating\/introspecting\/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.\n\nEither way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.\n\nIn particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.\n\nThere is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable\/offensive that the pain\/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure\/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental\/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears\/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and\/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences\/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas\/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers"

        "text":"Is this PTSD? What do I do? (19 y\/o male) About 2 months ago one night  I was delivering a pizza to an apartment building for my job. I left my car door unlocked for convenience when i just walked like 30 steps to the door to deliver it. A few minutes later when i got back in my car, i was grabbed from behind and felt a weapon against my back, then a second hooded figure got into the passenger side door. I was robbed for everything and was tazed, then they drove off in my car. \nSince then I think about the scenario multiple times every day and I think about it going differently or different things I could\u2019ve done. I think about killing them, being killed, avoiding it altogether, etc. I\u2019ve even thought about setting up a bait car running in the same parking lot and luckily finding the same 2 guys and gunning them down. Every time I think about it, my heart rate goes up and pounds, and every time other people talk about the situation that happened to me, I want to avoid it and shut it out. I feel like a weak person or lesser of a person after that, like there was more I could\u2019ve done. I even get mad at people sometimes and act aggressive verbally towards people I love when I\u2019ve just been thinking about it. I also have trouble falling asleep most nights just thinking about it, but I don\u2019t really have nightmares.\nI just want to know if this is PTSD, or if it\u2019s just anxiety or something. I do have anxiety, which has been really terrible, and within the last year I\u2019ve had panic attacks. If I do have PTSD, what do I do? I do have a therapist and psychiatrist already, and they know about what happened, but they don\u2019t know the details of my PTSD-like symptoms that I\u2019ve just discussed. What kind of treatment would there be for someone like me? I\u2019ve done a little research into PTSD treatment, which involves counseling and therapy, and medication as well. I\u2019m sure I could tell my therapist about my symptoms and could be helped for that, but what about medication-wise? I\u2019ve been on SSRIs like prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft before, but to no avail for my anxiety. Right now I\u2019m on Effexor, which is noticeably giving me a boost for depression, but not my anxiety\/ptsd-like symptoms. So what is left for me? I was on Klonopin and Ativan for like a month each for panic earlier this year, which helped tremendously for my sleep and my bad anxiety. However, i had a different psychiatrist at the time that I cant go back to. My current psychiatrist wouldn\u2019t even prescribe me only a few Ativan pills when i went on a trip recently that left me terrified, and it didn\u2019t go well at all (to be shortened). I know that benzodiazepines are addictive when taken long term, but I truly believe the benefits outweigh the risks for me right now. The only problem is my psychiatrist. I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m just after drugs (being a young man with depression), and he\u2019s made it clear before that he doesn\u2019t generally prescribe benzodiazepines. What are my options? I desperately need advice. Sorry for the long and badly structured rant by the way."

I'm 28 and have been doing talk therapy on and off since I was 9 years old and would say it's helped about 15-20%, definitely SOMETHING and am grateful for all of my therapists. But it left me feeling as though I was simply managing a lot of deeply entwined problems and not actually healing them. I really felt like I didn't have much to show for almost two decades. \n\nMy current therapist recommended EMDR and helped me to stop trivializing my childhood traumas. I did what a lot of us do and didn't think that my traumas weren't \"severe enough\" to be treated as PTSD. \n\nI am a highly functioning trauma victim\/survivor with a solid good-paying career, yet, I felt like I was being eaten alive from the inside by cannibals, on a daily basis. But you know, because I could hold down a job, I was obviously unworthy of actual trauma-treatment, (makes sense, right?).  \n\nMy first EMDR session the other day impacted me more around 85% - 90% as opposed to the normal 15 - 20% I mentioned earlier. We still have several sessions to go, but I am very excited for them and I don't plan on quitting talk therapy after we're done. \n\nAgain, this is a big big deal. I was pouring tears of joy by the end of it and it seems like I'm finally setting my fucked up, mangled, brain in a cast so it can heal. Someone else I read on here compared PTSD to a poison flowing through our bodies, and I feel like I am finally extracting it. Good luck, and I love you all."

        "text":"Everything keeps hitting me all at once Let me start this by saying I have PTSD. Everything hits me a bit harder than most people so if you think this is nothing, it may be for you but for me it's hell.\n\nLet's start with last week. I contacted Amazon over a pretty simple request. I'm on disability and didn't receive my cheque for December. I've been scraping by for that month and this by dumpster diving and panhandling. Merry Christmas to me I guess. At any rate, I contacted Amazon customer service with an off hand request. I had gotten a Prime trial and asked them if they could extend it for a month for free. I explained the situation. Didn't expect anything from it at all, but the reaction I got was weird. The person I was chatting to on their website started asking for order numbers. I said nevermind and ended the chat. 13 hours later he emails me to say he didn't understand what I was talking about and said to contact again. So I did. Weirdly, the second person was like \"No problem, done. Go enjoy The Grand Tour!\" So I tried to get on Prime and it didn't work. Figured I'd let it be for a couple days. \n\nWhile waiting, my roommate comes back. He left in November to go to India for the holidays. I forgot how much noise he made. He's on the phone at all hours of the day and night. He often puts the other person on speaker phone and will yell his responses. I can't sleep. I mean I can't afford my medication to sleep properly anyway, but this asshole is so fucking loud that I couldn't sleep if I did have the meds. I've gotten maybe 2-3 hours sleep since he returned last week. I turned the music on once at 10AM and he had the nerve to tell me to turn it down. That pissed me off even more. \n\nWhile all this is going on, I'm waiting for the government to tell me what happened to my disability cheque. They keep saying they're doing investigations and will have another sent out as soon as it's done, but that does fucking nothing for me. We don't have food stamps here so I can't go get that. Food bank is miles away and my knees are fucked, so getting there is hell to begin with and coming back takes multiple hours. Even if I did get there, I don't have a current statement from the government with my address on it because they didn't send the goddamned cheque. \n\nSo I go back to Amazon. Prime still isn't working. So Customer Service tells me it's just a glitch and they'll reach out to me in 12 hours. They do. 12 hours later they say I never had prime to begin with. So I contact customer service AGAIN. This time I get someone who calls me darling every 3 seconds despite me asking repeatedly for her to knock it off. She says that they did give me an extension on the prime but it was an extension of nothing because the prime was already over. She then hangs up on me. So I say fuck it and tweet Amazon. They respond and ask what's wrong. I explain. At this point I don't care about the free prime. I had no right to it anyway, I always thought it was a longshot, but being told a half dozen different things is just bizarre and confusing. They then don't respond for a day. So I say \"Uh hello?\" And another amazon rep comes on twitter to ask what's wrong. I explain again. No response. Today, 4 days later, I say that it's the worst service I've received. Amazon immediately jumps on and gives me a link to contact. I do and don't even get a chance to explain. The dude just says another department will reach out to me.\n\nThen I turn to Canada Post and ask why the hell I didn't get stuff delivered. They shrug and say \"We deliver until 8PM.\" I'm checking the mail continuously. We have no mail and no one else has gotten mail in the neighborhood. We live next door to a Canada Post and have never had this problem before. Maybe it's the weather? No. People across the road got their mail. Just that we didn't. So no cheque for me today despite being told I'd get it today. That means no eating today, no meds today, no paying bills today. Sitting in the dark crying all night. \n\nLike I said it in't much. But this is overwhelming to all hell to me and I'm freaking the fuck out. I want to beat the shit out of my roommate because he won't shut the fuck up, I want to scream my goddamn head off at Amazon because they won't give me a straight fucking answer. I want to lose my shit at the government because they lost my cheque and i've been without any money since the start of December. \n\nTo top it all off, a storm kicked up at 3PM and I can't go dumpster diving for any food. Tomorrow it's going to be worse and colder so I won't be able to go dumpster diving then either AND the mail likely won't show up again. \n\nI just fucking want this all to stop. everythnig. I can't get a breather. Meds I'm on barely work to begin with so when this shit happens I just feel lost and terrified and suicidal to all hell. I'm so... idk. overwhelmed. overloaded. Just something. "

It\u2019s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  \n\nI hid it from the court, because it\u2019s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.\n\nAfter a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn\u2019t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.\n\nIn my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.\n\n10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to \u201cjust climb out\u201d.  That fucking pit...\n\nTold the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I\u2019d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. \n\nThankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t want to deal with these people around me who didn\u2019t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn\u2019t want them to feel like me.  It\u2019s one of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you\u2019re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.\n\nTo avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It\u2019s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.\n\nWhat used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I\u2019ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven\u2019t done that since 06\u2019. \n\nAm I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That\u2019s still there right now.  But I\u2019m up.  \n\nI\u2019m doing choirs.  I\u2019m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it\u2019s been since I can remember.\n\nI\u2019ve read over what I\u2019ve written for about 20 min.    \n\nI guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:\n\nI still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I\u2019ll never be \u201cOk\u201d\n\nBUT\n\nThe pit is less deep and it\u2019s easier to climb out. \n\n\n\n"

I had already been in a long term battle with depression and anxiety, so I wasn't too surprised to have this thrown into the mix. A little backstory on me: I came from an abusive household and was put in foster care at 12, but aged out of the system as an unwanted kid. I've been abused in almost every way you can imagine by parents, foster parents, siblings, significant others, and peers.\n\nMy biggest issue right now is my physical symptoms. I thought I was handling everything well, but it's been brought to my attention that I'm not. I'm 24 and the longest I've held a job is 7 months. I work hard, but the stress of the job always eats away at me... physically. I get sick. VERY SICK. It all starts with headaches, then my body gets heavy, I catch fever and cough, headaches become migraines, then I'm throwing up and unable to move. It lasts for weeks, sonetimes months. My brain will be foggy. I'll forget what I'm saying as I say it. I forget important things. I forget to eat.\n\nEven as I write this now, I'm sick. I've been \"sick\" for over a month. I've never noticed the pattern before and now I'm feeling hopeless about the rest of my life. I'm in fine shape physically... But i don't understand how my anxiety and stress can have so much control over my health like it is.\n\nDoes this happen to anyone else?? "

It ended up in him saying that he does not want to deal with me anymore, that I have a part of me that is absolute trash and that he is done trying and does not want to contact me anymore and just wants to find someone else to love to repair what I broke. That crushed me.\n\nSo I went no contact for 2 weeks now, even though it is very hard because I have so much anxiety about people leaving me. And have send him a loving message stating that I still want to try my absolute best to improve to get him back, even though I already told him when he broke up but he wasn\u2019t interested then. But who knows... right? \n\nSince I have send the message today and he did not respond but saw it anyway, I started scrolling through old convo\u2019s. And I can\u2019t believe... what a monster I actually became. I threatened with suicide or shared suicidal thoughts when having extreme anxiety attacks. Putting him on trail: \u2018If you do this, I\u2019m going to die.\u2019 And even though I actually felt like that in the moment, reading all of it back makes me feel like a ansolute failure. I have hurt the person who I loved the most time and time again because I was so filled with anger and pain and I could not cope. So in stressful situations, I turned into a manipulative version of myself. \n\nMy first boyfriend was very emotionally abusive and used the same tactics. He completely isolated me, told me I was the most amazing person ever, then proceeded to tell how what an absolute crazy bitch I was who deserved all the bad karma in the world, talked me up about how he loved my red hair, then blocked me everywhere one day without answers and proceeded to date my then BFF (who colored her hair red which was weird and funny). That relationship left me with many scars and I started drinking because of it, as well as trying to find love in the wrong places. But I thought that after some years, I escaped the trauma.\n\nI recognize today that I never did and could not cope with my emotions which made me have extreme anxiety attacks, anger issues, no impulse control, manipulative behaviour to get what I wanted... Also towards my parents. I would say towards the people who support me most and were closest to me.\n\nI turned into the monster that I had despised so many years. How can I ever make up to my now ex BF? How can I try to repair the relationship and gain back his trust? But most importantly, how can I grow as a person from this and make sure I NEVER EVER EVER use that behaviour as a coping mechanism?\n\nI acknowledge that I am just very anger and sad towards the world and this makes me lash out the way I do, but it made me lose the one guy I truly loved. So how on earth can I actively work on myself, love myself and stop myself from doing what I did?"

Tried to help - feel like I really screwed up, feel like maybe I didn't.\n\nSorry if I ramble, I'm a bit shaken up. I was recently introduced to someone who also has PTSD. I was a bit reluctant to connect but decided to be cautiously optimistic as there aren't many ways to meet people here (besides bars) or any local PTSD peer\/group resources in our area for civilians. Done all the one on one with counselors and need to connect in person with others who can relate. Knowing to be careful in any case, and not looking for dating (and making that clear to him), we met a only a few times and chatted about how to address PTSD symptoms in a healthy manner. Friendly and polite, encouraging his engagement with hobbies while having some laughs as we seemed to share the same type of humour. Just decent human stuff.\n\nFast forward to today. Another invitation but me declining as I'm sicker than a dog with fever and chills. Christ if I didn't suddenly get multiple messages about how he'd received bad news and was in the middle of a PTSD episode. On to how I grounded him and helped him think clearer and had hopes I'd find him attractive, etc. Then sharing how missed his army buddies who'd died and wanted to give up as life is too painful. Over and over again. I tried calling but he wouldn't pick up. Just more messages of the same nature. And more.\n\nIt's an unsettling position and my heart was going out to him. I used to have the same dark thoughts time to time. There was also more than one occasion as a kid where someone gouged their wrists open in front of me or I had to hold them down because they were trying to throw themselves in harms way.\n\nNot knowing his family or anyone he might know, I looked up and called a vet line asking if they could help out. They instructed me contact the local RCMP. I did so, explaining the above and asking if they could just make sure he was okay.\n\nThey advised me to keep him engaged in conversation if I could while they sent someone over. Cut short our call when his doorbell rang. A few moments later, the RCMP called me back asking about his phone as it was going straight to voicemail and he had all his lights out and curtains drawn. All I could do was repeat the number. About 15 minutes later, a call back. He'd stated he was fine and downplayed his claims, citing counselors, medications, etc that he says he's accessing so they left.\n\nIn come a bunch of nasty messages. To the effect of \"if I really cared, I would have come over myself. He went on to state he'd been thrown around by members when having a bad day but he was just sad. That he has negative feelings toward them. That he'd made the mistake in trusting me and I overstepped boundaries. That civi's can't be trusted. How his last girlfriend had done the same thing to him by calling when he was just having a bad day. It was her fault the they'd roughed him up\". On and on. \n\nI could only tell him that I didn't have much choice. That I'm not their hugest fan the past couple years myself but he's expressing suicidal ideology, and I don't know who he has in his life he trusts. That no one was out to get him here and that I don't deserve to be punished for trying to do the decent human thing. And that I am not his girlfriend (only physical contact had been a quick hug as I left a few days ago). That if he reads his miles of texts it shows his PTSD in getting in the way of of non-professionals helping him right now and provided the local crisis line number. I wished him well and reminded him that I needed to be healthy and care of myself by blocking him. Done. Nothing nasty or confrontational. \n\nThing is, some stupid part of me still wants to apologize and calm him down. I'd meant no harm at all but screwed up. I'm jumping at every little sound and feel as though I'm somehow \"in trouble\" for some misdeed. I don't think my cell block even works properly but I'm afraid to look and find out. Having been brought up being held responsible for others' unpredictable actions and fists slammed on me for not measuring up to babysitting them, it can grind a person down. After how long I'm finally starting to see that in me now? Jesus.\n\nI was also just starting to get to the point in life of emotionally realizing that I'm not as obligated as I feel or as others have guilted me to feel. There's a tiny part in me that knows I don't deserve this dynamic, and even wants to say \"I don't owe you or anyone else anything. Get off my back\". It doesn't feel strong at the moment, but it's probably just tiredness, flu, and needing to go back to bed. What a bunch of high school crap.\n\nBut I do miss my home city. You can at least try to escape into the crowds if you need to get away. Maybe even utter a quick \"Fuck off, freak\" before running."

Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another. \u00a0Starting therapy takes a lot of courage; when you work with a therapist ,once you feel safe , \u00a0you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before. \u00a0I have seen \u00a0people cry with sadness , cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time, cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard. \u00a0 I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving. \u00a0\u00a0I can assure you that most , if not all , therapists expect clients to cry \u00a0and there is nothing to be embarrassed about. \u00a0 Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down. \u00a0 Crying is \u00a0often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal .So , to summarize , don't worry at all about crying! It will probably feel uncomfortable \u00a0at first , but I promise you , you will not be judged for crying in therapy. \u00a0 And it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and won't judge you !Good luck !!"

I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life\u2019s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.\n\n2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I\u2019m seeing therapists but they haven\u2019t put down a diagnosis yet) as I\u2019m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I\u2019ve had to stop work for the moment because I can\u2019t cope.\n\nI am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner\u2019s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.\n\nIt\u2019s father\u2019s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven\u2019t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it\u2019s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don\u2019t resolve any issues. And it\u2019s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn\u2019t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it\u2019s taken a full toll on me.\n\nThe relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn\u2019t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father\u2019s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad\u2019s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn\u2019t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I\u2019m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I\u2019m terrified about my future and whether I\u2019ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I\u2019m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn\u2019t that good to start with. My parents don\u2019t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).\n\nRight now I don\u2019t feel safe and I don\u2019t know what to do. This post didn\u2019t really have a question - I am just massively triggered right now and want to vent my story anonymously. Thanks for reading."

I get how upsetting this is.If I was your therapist, I'd want to explore this a good deal, because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening. Be careful not to jump to conclusions.\u00a0Sometimes people have been slowly \"falling out of love\" for a long time, and often this is due to some (perhaps unnamed) unmet need in the marriage. She may have been coming to this point over a period of time, and has only finally said so.\u00a0It's also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisis...she's changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it. Only she can help herself through this (she could get the help of a therapist, but it's not your place to tell her to do this).\u00a0Or, it's possible she's met this new \"friend\" and her attachment to him has clouded her view, or clarified something for her. \u00a0Right now, it's important that you respect your wife's decision to separate, if she's asking for that. We can't trap people in a marriage. If she needs separation, or distance, then it's respectful to give her that.That doesn't mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now. I would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what YOU want; whether it's to move on with your life, or wait patiently for a period of time.\u00a0I can't predict what will happen here. But you can find out what the best path for you is. I wish you the best."

        "text":"Need Advice: GF with severe PTSD and Roommates My girlfriend of (almost) 3yrs has PTSD, extreme anxiety, and deals with pretty severe depression. After 2yrs, I finally got her to a doctor so she could start an anti-depressant regiment. I didn\u2019t just push her to do it, thinking it would change everything. When we began dating, we had known each other for a few months (work), and anxiety was apparent. I learned of her PTSD and Depression shortly into the relationship. I deal with depression myself, so I wasn\u2019t about to give up on someone for things they can\u2019t control. I was clear with her of my goal for her in our relationship: to be happy and healthy.\n\nHer family life is almost non existent, and she has moved around most of her life. She severed ties with (some of) the abusive relationships in her life about 2 years ago. We moved in together because we spent most of our time together and we wanted to save money. It\u2019s been almost 2 years living together (after only 8-10 months of dating). Cracks are beginning to show.\n\nWe have two roommates, who I like very much. She always got along with them until recently. Our apartment is 2 couples, M-F \/ M-F. It\u2019s a two bedroom, so yes, it gets a little cramped, even though its a big place, one bathroom is a constant pest. \n\nLately (past 6 months), the girl living with us has made it clear about keeping things clean, using our own appliances.. usual passive-aggressive roommate stuff. I\u2019m used to it, I do NOT take it personally from the girl, we still chat in a very friendly way frequently, and I\u2019m good friends with her boyfriend. I see these grievances as small troubles, roommates setting boundaries, etc.\n\nWe have lived with this couple for the entirety of us living together. Problems just started to arise about 6 months ago. The girl would get pissed at messy bathroom, moldy stuff in fridge, etc. NEVER became vocal about these problems. Began to show some passive aggressive behavior: Slamming bathroom door, leaving notes, sending TWO texts, JUST TWO over a few months.\n\nI see this stuff as normal, my girlfriend is losing her mind. The slamming of bathroom doors led to her having flashbacks of her shitty father. I spoke with the roommate, and explained the situation. It stopped happening. The girl asked that my GF start using her own electric kettle due to overlapping morning schedules. My GF\u2019s electric kettle was given to her by one of her attackers at her last apartment. That was hard to explain to girl, so we gave it away to avoid more triggers for my girlfriend.\n\nNow, my girlfriend is being triggered by the girl loudly doing her own dishes. This, I had to make a stand on. They were not my gf\u2019s dishes. She had no dogs in the fight. Yet she blamed her INCREDIBLE anger where she stormed into our room and stayed for the night, on loud dish-doing. \n\nMy girlfriend is not a clean person. I can deal with it, try to get her to clean, but it is not my roommates\u2019 fault that she is this way. \n\nThe girl left a note on a tupperware container tonight saying \u2018PLEASE DISPOSE\u2019 and my girlfriend lost it. Inside? A month of veggie smoothie mix that had a lump of mold in it so large that I couldn\u2019t wash it down the sink, I had to pick it out and trash it.\n\nMy girlfriend? Threw a fit and LEFT IT OUT on the counter. Walked away from it. Meanwhile the moldy cup in the living room I asked her to clean will start a fight if I bring it up. \n\nThe note? She wrote 'FUCK OFF' on it, then threw it away out of regret(?). Left it for me (I guess?) to clean, like everything else.\n\n\nThis escalation between the girl and my GF is getting out of hand. We are moving in 6months. I believe that my GF is overreacting and its unnecessary anger, stress, and confusion adding to the situation. \n\nI have stood by my GF for almost 3 years. I have read about PTSD, slowly pushed her towards treatment (finally got her to the Dr for anti-depressants, she hadn\u2019t been to a Dr in many many years). I have tried (slowly) to get her to therapy.. we made a few appointments that she canceled (a while ago). \n\nI feel like my GF isn\u2019t trying. She is being overloaded. She is also being selfish and rude when that is in NO WAY the person I knew years ago. I have been patient with her conditions. I have tried nothing but to help her. I have made stands on some things (almost exclusively cleaning, especially our room that looks like a disaster area, due to her). I\u2019m approaching the end of my rope. Completely ignoring me begging her for years to clean, explaining that it stresses me out the way her triggers do, is starting to really piss me off and make me feel like she doesn't care about my happiness if it means an ounce of work for her. \n\n**TL;DR** My GF is freaking out over my roommate\u2019s recent actions. I believe it is a completely irrational response. I have taken triggers into consideration, but believe she is being selfish and closing off. I have tried to help her as much as possible, but I have my fears that if this is how she acts now, what will our future (on a different coast we\u2019re moving to) hold. That fear has me questioning our future, viability, health, etc.\n\nAny input would help. I can\u2019t possibly say I fully understand PTSD, but I have tried for years to help her, and plan to continue. I feel insensitive when claiming a trigger or her anxiety in certain situations if irrational, but I truly feel this has been. I can give more specifics about her PTSD. Apologies for throwaway, want to protect her privacy. \n\nThanks\n"

Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. \n\n*My dad did drugs\n*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once\n*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once\n*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)\n*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.\n*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)\n*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we \"misbehaved\" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit\/ locked in closets\/ stepped on.\n*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. \n*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep\/ high\/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. \n*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. \n*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.\n*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.\n*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. \n*I was in a \"relationship\" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).\n*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. \n\nAll of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.\n\nI want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old. I want a chance to be 5 again. But I don't want to die.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n"

I remember in 5th grade I got off the bus and two women jumped me, broke my nose and left me bloody.. a few months later another woman assaulted me at school, and would throw me against the locker(she was much older than me). I also got in multiple fights with people and I saw some fucked up shit like a cat getting ripped to shreds by my own dog.. After that I would see dead animals on the side of the road and break down in tears. I was a bully in school too. always built with rage. One time a kid jumped on my back and bit my shoulder and In response I body slammed him on the concrete because he freaked me out. I put him in the hospital and his dad threatened to kill me (I was 13, He was in his 40's). I was going to be charged with assault even though I was defending myself unless I wrote my bully a letter saying that I'm sorry. The reason I was in the wrong is because I'm a huge dude and he was half my size. It was fucking stupid. I also had my nose broken again in high school when I got drunk at a party and this guy jumped me on the side of the road, he bloodied up my face pretty good... a few months later I was assaulted by a couple claiming to be part of the neighborhood watch, they had their 5 year old kid with them and they pinned me down in the woods, wouldn't let me go for an hour. It was completely dark and I was terrified. They told me I was going to murder their child and I had to be stopped, when in reality all I was doing was fucking around at the lake throwing leaves at my buddy. I grew up around drugs, and meth heads which is why all the teenagers around me were so fucked up, they had fucked up parents who didn't give a shit and were abusive. I left town when I was 18 and moved to Seattle, got a job at McDonald's and started therapy. I had a suicide attempt that same year and that put me in the hospital for a few weeks. I left my job at McDonald's a few weeks later, got a job at amazon and started making something of myself. But I struggle around people, I always have. My coping mechanism is painting, I'm an artist outside of work and it's something I care deeply about. I'm thinking of leaving Amazon to become an artist because that's what I want to do. I don't care if it's hard, I've had a lifetime of hardship so I know what hard is. Anyways this is more of a rant than an explanation. I had a very abusive childhood and it's made me have thick skin, It's why I am the man I am.. "

        "text":"Iv had ptsd for 10 Years, I was never told what to expect or what a flash back is. A little insight in to my more manic\/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days\/week in the hospital she couldn\u2019t stand with out pain.\nFor the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I\u2019d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn\u2019t go in I\u2019d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn\u2019t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.\nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a\/b cup back up to a d\/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time\n\nIv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can\u2019t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don\u2019t really talk in therapy session and the reply\u2019s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school\n\nThere\u2019s an emotion I feel when I\u2019m in a state sometimes, it\u2019s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it\u2019s like there\u2019s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there\u2019s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I\u2019m experiencing and I\u2019m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can\u2019t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.\n  |\n^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^\n\nNo one ever told me what ptsd really entails, if you cold give me a little insight, it would be appreciated.  x\n"

        "text":"Another terrible anniversary. Woke up crying. I'm ashamed and I hate myself. (Sexual abuse and violence) I missed the primary elections two years ago because two years ago yesterday, my ex dislocated my arm in three places in the wee hours of the morning and threw my car\/house keys into his lawn in the dark and rain. I was still trying to get it back together because I couldn't explain it at the ER and I didn't want insurance make me have to face him in court. I should have seen it coming. Three months before that, he screamed in my face and grabbed me by the shoulders. I ignored the blazing red flags. I still experience daily pain. Roughly twelve hours before that he'd shoved me over the couch (I have a serious back injury which I finally had my spine fused for recently, and that has long been a huge no no for me) and yanked my pants down to try to fuck me while his 4 y.o. daughter was in the bathroom. He was angry he didn't succeed because she finished using the bathroom too quickly. I was shocked because he hadn't done anything like that in the 11.5 months we'd been together, but as a testament to my prior experiences with abuse, I saw it as nothing terribly abnormal. This was what I'd always known relationships to be, whether it be family, friends, or intimate relationships.\n\nI was supposed to move in with them in a couple weeks. I wanted to wait until a year in, because I knew deep down he was a bad guy, but I wanted to be wrong. I wanted to be a mom (I can't have kids), and I wanted to save his daughter from the life I had growing up. He used this all against me. He's a narcissist and has some severely anti-social tendencies. \n\nLast night I had a nightmare involving me babysitting for him and his ex-wife, and their friends drugging me to rape me when they brought the party home. It brought back all the bad and my husband (we met two years ago next month) has super-hearing abilities and heard me crying while he was in the bathroom getting ready for work. He came out to hold me. Now he's gone and I'm crying again, damn it. It brought back all the memories of all the physical and sexual assaults and rapes I've experienced. People like that can smell a victim a mile away. \n\nThe shame is so overwhelming right now. That I let it happen. My entire life. From the first time I didn't say anything aged six. I just want to forget. I don't want to feel these people touching me. So many people, so many times, I've literally lost count. The things I've let happen because I never understood that people who love you don't hurt you like that. Things I let happen because I was conditioned to believe from such a young age that that is what life is. Hiding, hurting, and being used. Because I never saw the value in myself as a person. I still don't. I'm a garbage person. \n\nMy husband was the first to tell me that it wasn't normal to let myself be an object. A fuck toy and a punching bag. I had just accepted my fate that it was my place to be used and abused. That my normal was to live in fear of being hurt or fucked. I was 34 when we met. Now, after all the years of being used like a Kleenex, I feel so dirty, ashamed, and undeserving of someone as wonderful as he is. I feel like if he truly knew all that had happened, all the things I let happen, though I've shared a lot with him, that he would be disgusted. He's a better person than that, I know. But I feel unworthy of love, and unworthy of the safety I have with him now. This morning I told him I often wonder if I'd met him sooner, if I'd believe him or just brush him off as some bullshit fairytale who would eventually hurt me in the same ways. It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that.\n\nI'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all. A couple months ago I asked my psychiatrist if ECT would make me forget. Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. \n\nTl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner. "

        "text":"New to Reddit and this diagnosis \/\/ I have questions *Hello, before i start this weird post that i'm pretty sure nobody will end up reading let me get a couple things situated. Hi, i'm Uncomfy and i'm new to Reddit. I made this account because specific people in my life say that i have too many issues and i'm uncomfortable to be around. So i made this account specifically for asking questions about things that relate to mental health, and occasionally things i like to indulge in to keep myself preoccupied from the outside world. Hopefully this will cause my issue of being an uncomfortable person.Before i start i must specify that i am not making anything i say up or am doing this for attention. I have no idea how Reddit works, so i apologize if i don't do things that people may find mandatory. (I would appreciate They\/them pronouns if you end up responding to this post please.)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TW\/\/ Slurs, cutting, depressive thoughts**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, lets get this thing started. Im a 16 year old that has recently been diagnosed with PTSD. My whole life i can only remember my mom being an unreliable black blur. You can't approach her and get a read on her emotions, she'll completely switch up on a word, or even a pen dropping could send her into a rage. I can't approach her without preparing myself first. My Dad tells me i remember a happier time, when she wasn't like this, that it wasn't my whole life. But i honestly can't remember anything other than fear and anger. It started fairly simple. When i was 8 years old my mom was trying to help me study for a spelling bee. She would yell and hold me down in the chair until i correctly spelled a word several times in a row. If i messed up any word she would call me retarded, which is a word i grew up with and was called a lot. But whatever, she was being a mom. That was fair, she was parenting fine, im just being paranoid. When i was 7 i stole from a bookstore, a turtwig pencil to be exact. I still remember it because of its figurine of turtwig standing on a pokeball. I understand that it was wrong and im sorry that i did it, i still heavily regret it. I remember i was caught in the parking lot of the school. I had to go back inside and apologize to the librarian that was running the store. I was bawling as i gave my apology, the librarian accepted my apology and said i could have the pencil free of charge. When i got home my mom took me into her room, made me show her the pencil and asked if it was worth it. Then she hit me various times with my dad's belt. i remember this specifically because of the scars it left on my back. After the belt she told me to go outside and pick the biggest branch i could and if i didn't pick one big enough she'd find one herself and beat me several more times than she already would have. I remember crying in my backyard not wanting to return, and looking into the forest\/cornfield behind me and thinking i could hide in there. I dont remember much after that, it hurt. 10 years old. Birthday party argument. She pulled my hair, slapped me at home. I cried. 11,12,13 years old. It all got increasingly worse. Slapping, hitting, belts on back, belts on legs, sticks on head, sticks on back, glass. I didn't think i did anything wrong to initiate these things but came out of all of them feeling like i caused it. I still feel this way. 14 and 15 were the same. All throughout the year, months, weeks, days. More and more and more belts, sticks, glass, pulling hair, yelling,, yelling, so much yelling. In my face, i couldn't get away. Placed in corners so many times, i couldn't get away, i was trapped. I remember the things she said about my appearance, my personality, my art, the things i liked to watch and read. Retarded, you're so fat, obese whale, failure, you're the worst child i ever had, i hate you so fucking much, i wish you never existed. I heard those things multiple times every day, (i still do lmao). I remember the first time i truly wanted myself dead was 14. I was so broken inside, school wasn't helping either (but i won't get into that because its a whole other can of worms). I remember every day i walked home from school i was stop at the church, go to its kitchen area and cry. I would cry and cry and bang my head on the hard tables. I would take their best knives and cut as far into my skin as i could go and thoroughly wash the knives afterwards. Then i'd finish walking home. I will never forget what happened next for the next of my life. Its probably why i can't recount the rest of everything so well. But i do know that this will always stick with me. I don't know how it happened, but me and my mom got into an argument. She grabbed a pillow, told me she just wanted me to shut up and threw me against my bed. She got on top of me and put the pillow on my face. She held it there applying more pressure as time went on. I was freaking out, i didn't know what to do. I tried to throw her off of me, didn't work, i was too weak. Tried clawing the pillow off, nothing was working. I thought i was gonna die. I honest to god can't remember what happened next. All i know is that i woke up on my bed, by door was closed and the pillow was beside me. I genuinely thought i had a nightmare. I doubted myself so much that i didn't know until that night that it was real. How do i know? Did she apologize or approach me about it? No. When i went to go brush my teeth that night i saw in the mirror scratches on my face and neck that weren't there before. I've never been able to forget it. I have nightmares and panic attacks of the exact moment. I get flashbacks of her hitting me in corners where i cant get away. I fucking hate it, i don't know what's wrong with me. I know im exaggerating, i know she was only parenting. Im sorry. Im sorry im really getting off track here. I need to finish this before i regret what im doing. After that moment my mother kept putting her hands on me and yelling at me. All the time. But slowly i started taking care of my other siblings, even my mom. She was becoming so inept, forgetting things, snapping, changing emotions, not able to parent. So i had to step up at do the job. I realized this on my 15th birthday. Where nothing went right (as expected, they never do haha). After that i did everything, cooked, cleaned, disciplined, i became the parent. My siblings didnt take me seriously (They were 17, 13, and 11) but it didn't matter as things were being taken care of. I tried to explain all of this chaos to my dad which didn't take me seriously and said i was exaggerating (which i still probably am) and to forget about it. Conditions in the house became worse than they were. Nobody took my mom screaming about her screaming she was gonna kill herself and leaving seriously anymore on the account of they happened so often. My brothers became rowdy and often fought and argued frequently they resort to trying to suffocate people with grocery bags to pulling knifes on each other to try to end things. But it always results in me having to stop it. It always makes me want to pull my hair out. We we'rent a family. We didn't feel like it, we never did. I had an older sister that would always run away and would snap at me when i would say anything to her. I had to become her therapist. I had to become the family's therapist, always being the middle man in situations and fights. Giving as much advice i could give to them about their frequent problems, which i couldnt blame. I was snapping, everything was getting to me. Frequent panic attacks, flashbacks, stress of being family\/mom's therapist while afterwards being hit and called names. I couldnt take it anymore. My dad gave me a doctor. I couldnt open up to any of them and gave the most minimum details without going into family life (i couldnt because my dad is a respected gov. official and known throughout the entire state). They diagnosed me with depression. That started the influx of meds. After that mess they put me with another doctor because the previous one wasnt even listening to me but putting me on a new med every time like i was an experiment to them. After this doctor i was given a therapist. Flash forward to a month ago. Im diagnosed with PTSD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***I skipped A LOT of other issues\/things. Involving internal hate, friend debacle, school, more family issues and dynamics, ect, ect, This basically scratched the surface of my issue. If i don't regret doing this maybe i'll follow up venting about all of those other issues. (im making this account\/making this post at 6am because of not being able to sleep for 23 hours lmao).***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions. **Am i crazy?** i gave the rundown of my life for these questions. I feel so alone and scared constantly and i always feel like there's something wrong with what my mom has done, but then i immediately flip on myself and think im exaggerating, its a constant battle. Im so scared, i don't want to offend people that are older and went through so much for me to be popping in the subreddit to be just an entitled kid with a tiny issue. **Should i say i have PTSD?** As i said before, i dont want to pop in here being the most bratty entitled kid or whatever. But i dont know if ive been misdiagnosed. I think im shaming this safe safe by putting myself in it. **Ways to cope.** I haven't been coping well, i know it sounds edgy but cutting is mostly how i handle my pain. Cutting and hitting myself. Is there any smart ways that y'all cope to get out of a panic attack or a flashback ect? **im sorry.** I feel apologetic. I feel as if i have more questions but can't pinpoint them. Im sorry i had to waste your time if your even reading this. Im sorry if im a misdiagnosed snowflake, i probably am. But regardless, thank you for taking the time to read this. I know its been a messy read with tons of grammar mistakes and cringe like wording but i truly appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of your night\/morning and have a wonderful week. &lt;3"

I pretty much blanked on much of my early life before going to school; my elementary years were marked by extreme fear and neuroticism; from junior high on I was numb and depressed. Understanding my father now as a pedophile, narcissist, and abuser has been the missing key to explaining so much about my life. Now I\u2019m trying to recondition my behavior to be adaptive instead of maladaptive, which means piecing together the origins of my fears and anxieties.\n\nAs a child, I hated dolls and sought the comfort of stuffed animals instead. As an adult with overt PTSD, I notice I have a heavy preference for non-human animal company. I struggle with some misanthropy. Was my doll phobia related to the sexual abuse? Did I see myself as a doll in some way? I was super triggered by the movie The Exorcist, and as an adult, I see so many commonalities with child sexual abuse.\n\nI also had a phobia of mirrors. Whenever I would brush my teeth, I was terrified that when I looked down to spit and looked back up, my face would be different, or someone would be behind me. As an adult, I realize I never had a stable sense of self. My existence was always conditional (on appeasing my abuser). And I wasn\u2019t allowed to have my own will, not when it conflicted with his. As I\u2019ve become more comfortable with myself, mirrors scare me less. This one makes sense to me.\n\nThe cockroach one can probably be explained by some traumatic instances with roaches. I remember being at Fuddruckers, there being a cockroach on the wall and me being concerned but my family ignoring me, and later the cockroach being in my burger. Things get foggy after that... I don\u2019t remember if I took a bite of the burger. Another possibility is that my father abused me in a roach-infested place, like the office building he forced us to work in. I remember having to spend nights there and being terrified of the giant flying roaches. \n\nHas anyone been able to figure out their childhood phobias? I also had some OCD behavior in the bathroom, like counting down from flushing the toilet and washing my hands, or getting up from the bath to dry off and get dressed\u2014 I had to do it within the countdown otherwise \u201cthe monsters would get me.\u201d"

        "text":"Should I go for a diagnosis? TLDR: Sorry for the long post just looking for clarification on if what I have been experiencing through my teenage years is somehow connected to PTSD\n\nI'm currently 17 years old and after research I seem to have almost every single symptom of PTSD. The main reason I found this is because anytime I am yelled at by anyone (mainly parents) I instantly go into full panic mode and it feels like my whole body freezes up. This happens even when I know they aren't trying to yell at me but are just raising their voice. The reason I am confused is because I cannot remember a traumatic event in my life that would be substantial enough to cause something like this. The symptoms I experience that may or may not be connected to PTSD include:\n\nFear and avoidance of situations where either being yelled at or being made fun of is a possibility\nExtreme social anxiety to the point where it is difficult for me to make new friends outside of my group and has caused me to avoid relationships because I am afraid of rejection\/being laughed at by the school\nParanoia involving being attacked or bad things happening to family members even though I live in a suburb that never has crime\nDifficulty sleeping with no specific cause, usually at night I just am constantly in my thoughts playing out millions of different scenarios in my head\nFeelings of isolation, mainly that I am somehow not like everyone else because of all these symptoms and my ADHD diagnosis, this causes me to isolate myself and run away from problems such as walking away from a conversation with my parents if I get yelled at for something\nAnd finally the strongest symptom I have is constantly replaying bad moments in my life or imagining bad things that have never happened\n\nUnrelated to these symptoms I find that I struggle with addiction\/self damaging behavior as just 6 months ago I finally was able to stop smoking weed daily (after a consecutive 4 months straight) due to the fact that it relieved many of these negative feelings. The only reason I was able to stop was because I was caught being high by my parents and immediately had a panic attack that ended up with an ambulance ride to the hospital."

There was no cheating involved. But to keep it short we have been through a lot recently. We\u2019ve been through therapy and I\u2019ve had 3 sessions of EMDR that have helped.\n\nHowever no matter how good a session goes with my therapist I go back to my apartment and fall into the same depressive trap every time. All my bad memories are there. We are moving to a different state in less than a month but being at my current situation is eating me alive. \n\nI\u2019m fine when I\u2019m not there, whether that be with her somewhere or at work. My therapist thinks I\u2019m a sense it is \u201cptsd\u201d. I hate most moments I\u2019m there and sleeping helps me get through them faster. Whether it be at night or me feeling down when I initially wake up for the day before work I am a mess. \n\nHas anyone experienced anything like this to a degree? I can\u2019t stand the fact of going back home today. I\u2019m scared and I think this is what is causing me not to be able to completely get through the issues the girlfriend and I are having because I am constantly reminded of them by where I live.

        "text":"There are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision.  Here are a few examples. \u00a0The counselor may determine that the client's needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with.  A person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed, it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue.  If that issue is outside the competence of the counselor, the counselor should look for alternatives, the most common of which would be to terminate and refer.  Beyond clinical issues, this could also come up around particular other related facts, such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues.  This could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client's issues. \u00a0Another reason for discharge (and possible referral) would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit.  No counselor is the right person to work with everyone.  If the right level of connection is not happening, the counselor will often look first at what they are doing, might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things don't seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work.  A similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations, not doing any agreed on work between sessions, showing up late or being really guarded in session. \u00a0The easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on.  While this is the easiest one to determine, it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end.  However, counselors know that this is part of the process.  They will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end.  This type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into."

[nsfw] Marked as NSFW as it might be triggering to those who dealt with abusive households. \n\nIn December, I decided to spontaneously cease contact with my dad when an opportunity arose. I had been ruminating over that thought for years. I thought I would be free of his emotional abuse, the feeling of being suffocated and having to answer to him. To my surprise, it got really bad. I began to dwell more on the past, and my mom was continuously making me feel guilty, claiming to not understand what could\u2019ve possibly went wrong. This was exhausting to go through. I developed a severe marijuana addiction as a result of being unable to cope with those emotions. I was seeing a psychiatrist but they were ignorant to trauma. \n\nLast year, I witnessed the van attack in Toronto and it\u2019s aftermath as I walked past Yonge street that day after work, bodies still laid down at 9 pm as the investigation wasn\u2019t complete. This shook my sense of safety as well. I didn\u2019t realize until my first appointment last week with a trauma specialist that it deeply disturbed me and made me incredibly uncomfortable in public. \n\nI\u2019m almost done, I swear. \n\nNow I\u2019m realizing how my mom was potentially worse than my dad in some regards. Some of the things she said to me when I decided to cut contact are now things that have made me want to stop contact with her. \u201cI chose you my whole life over him and I suffered for it.\u201d Not really something I wanted to hear, something she likely thinks I\u2019ve forgotten.

Today was different. \n\nWhen he got up he grab my arms and I grabbed his back ready to wrestle. Thats when I felt something hit my in the ear hard and my leg buckled.

Again, I was thrown to the ground, hit in the side of the face multiple times, and had the back of my head slammed into the concrete. \n\nI walked home to find a knife, any weapon, but couldn't find anything but a brick in my front yard. I walked back to scare him to try and get him to back down. I didn't ever want to hurt anyone. I dropped the brick and again I was thrown to the ground, punched repeatedly and had my head slammed. It must have been 3,4,5 times. \n\nI walked home with that \"friend\" and immediately cried and broke down. This day has replayed in my head freqently ever since it happened. I turned to drugs at 14. Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything.

In many ways, we react to our environments - and if you're still surrounded by neighbors who didn't reach out when they heard your ex yelling or offer assistance and resources when your son acted differently than his peers, it might make sense that you're more timid around folks. It might also be worth thinking about where your bar is set: do you want to be as comfortable around people as you were before your recent circumstances? Or find your new normal, and connect only with people who raise you up and bolster your self-esteem? You have the right to be both cautious (if you're still surrounded by the same folks and environment) and discerning - only connecting with people who will be supportive. All the best~"

At times during those 4 years, I was emotionally abused (i.e. not being allowed to express negative emotions, being falsely accused of sexual misconduct, etc.). A year after I had left the community, my mom and I had to revisit the area, in a building right near the facility I once lived in. I began to have a panic attack when I was there. When I see the people associated with the traumatic events, it feels as though an old wound is opening up. Then, I sometimes have an emotional meltdown or I simply shut down and pretend to be a character in one of my fantasy stories so that I can disassociate from the revisiting of the emotional trauma.

It controls your behavior, even though you\u2019re not conscious of it. How does it work? When something upsets us\u2014and that something could be a sound, a sight, or just a gut feeling\u2014the amygdala sends notice to our bodies to prepare to fight or flee: the heartbeat speeds up, the blood pressure rises, and breathing quickens. During an argument, you\u2019ll often notice a physical response similar to how you react to fear (for instance, rapid heartbeats and tensing muscles). Recognizing that, your conscious mind (which resides in the prefrontal cortex) can refuse to obey its instructions. Typically, these amygdala hijackings come on fast and dissipate quickly, except in rare cases, such as when a person develops post-traumatic stress disorder from a particularly horrible event or series of events. Knowing how these hijackings work, you know that if you allow yourself to react spontaneously, you will be prone to overreact. You can also comfort yourself with the knowledge that whatever psychological pain you are experiencing will go away before very long.'\n\nThis is exactly how I feel a lot, 'hijacked'.\n\nI can not related it with another feeling but with stress. \n\nThe 'fight or flight' feeling. Sometimes I feel a lot of fear, and sometimes I am confrontational to an irrational level.\n\nI was badly hurt physically when I was very young, which led to some physical growth problems. Since then I really didn't understand why I could be so stressed all the time. I'm glad this group exists, and I'm glad there is a way out.\n\nJust needed to share this is my first post here."

Always remember that NO means NO, respect her, respect yourself, and be a normal teenager! Have a healthy relationship. Holding hands, kissing, and more should only be done when both are comfortable with it and agree to it. Although it is frowned upon by a lot of people, it's no secret that teenagers do have sex (even if their parents and perhaps religion would definitely not want them to do it). Only you can make the choice that is right for you. Just be responsible in the choices you make. Some states have laws on what age is old enough for consensual sex. You'd be surprised how young those ages are. A 14 year old having sex with a 20 year old would be against the law, but someone the same age as her, or just one year older is not. \"Wrong\" can be defined in a lot of different ways, though. Is it against the law? No. Is it against your religion? I can't answer that for you.\u00a0You can, however, have a relationship that is not physical in any way. It's okay to just be with her and enjoy her company. You can hang out, watch movies together, go on dates, do whatever it is that both of you enjoy doing.

        "text":"I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**\n\n\n\n**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7\" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2\" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.\n\nFast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  \n\nAnother episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.\n\nI know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.\n\nSorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.\n\n**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**\n\n\n"

However, I'm studying abroad in france for this semester and I'm about to run out of this medication, and I cant get anyone to prescribe me a medication I feel comfortable taking, so I may just have to go off my meds. In france it seems that doctors just automatically want to give you xanex for anything anxiety related, obviously I dont think theres anything wrong with taking Xanex in general, if it helps someone thats great but since I have been taking a non-addictive medication in the states that has worked wonders, and my US doctor has made it clear she doesn't like prescribing Xanex unless nothing else works I'm incredibly uncomfortable with it. I have now been going to doctors appointments for a month now trying to get something I can take (I've taken SSRI's before, and while they still leave me with way too many mental illness symptoms, the worst of them are gone), and of the 5 different doctors appointments I've had all have been really against prescribing me anything other than  Xanex. Im honestly just so scared, the last time I went off medications I failed every assignment I had during that time period, and spent almost every second of my day in bed feeling like crap, and this time, since I'm abroad I don't even have friends that I can reach out to in person, just through text for the second half of the day, thanks to the time difference. I've already noticed my mental health getting significantly worse just from the stressed cause by all this. I'm just so worried, and I know the worry is just going to make everything worse, because even though i'm medicated right now its making me miserable, so I'm going to crash fast and of course I'm going to dun out right in the middle of midterm week.

I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things. You can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision, but ultimately he has to decide what to do. Know that you won't be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening, validating his feelings,\u00a0and understanding. Regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook up....I'm not sure if that is possible. If you care for him on more than a friendship level, then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what.

I wonder what it is that you feel when you're not in a relationship?Because of the way you asked the question, I'm getting the impression that you are referring to romantic relationships. I wonder if you have close friendships that could form a network to help with this when you are not romantically involved with someone. Even when you are in a relationship with a romantic partner, having friends is still an important element.I wonder if you could also notice what changes for you inside of yourself (as far as emotions) when you move from not being in a relationship to being in one.Perhaps you could take a look at what you value about yourself.In general, it is natural for people to want to be in relationships with others (in this case, relationship has many meanings and degrees). Most of us enjoy sharing elements of our days, thoughts, feelings, etc. with someone else who we trust and care about \u2013 also hoping they care about us in return."

        "text":"Last March I saw a therapist for the first time because of my severe depression and anxiety. She claimed I had PTSD, I dismissed it at the time, now I'm wondering if she was right. So last March I was really at my lowest emotionally. I was depressed and suicidal, considering killing myself. But I had just got health insurance for the first time since I was 18 through the ACA and used the opportunity to seek help. After a referral from my GP I got an appointment to see a therapist. \n\nGoing to my first appointment I was just about at the point of giving up. I was full of anxiety every day, I was completely stressed out, but I was eager to see her. At the mental health facility that my insurer had, Kaiser Permanente, they gave me a tablet to fill out a questionnaire on. Many of the questions were about my emotional state, how I've been handling them, if I'd considered hurting myself or others. In many of them I was thinking about these things on a daily basis or every other day. \n\nI was being entirely truthful in filling it out because I was scared I was overreacting and being just needy for attention or validation. Which was why when I was finished and the therapist called me into her office for my session sometime after filling it out, I thought she was wrong when she said the questionnaire said there was a likelihood I had PTSD.\n\nI dismissed it immediately, assuming I was just being overly dramatic and the results were skewed as a result. I mean, I've been spanked once or twice when I was a kid, but I wasn't routinely hit, or sexually abused. I wasn't in the military and I've spent most of my life in largely safe neighborhoods. Granted, there were a lot of heated arguments between my mom and stepfather, or just in general with my close family, but that was mostly it. \n\nI dismissed it, thought it was kind of an odd little anecdote, moved on. Then, a few months back, I was on Reddit, reading some post about a person who went to a restaurant with their SO. Their partner had PTSD, and one of their triggers was christmas music. They had to leave for a smoke because of it, and when they returned the restaurant had changed the music to make it more comfortable for them.\n\nHonestly, this was the first non-fictional representation of PTSD I've really ever read, and it kind of struck a cord with me, and over the past few months I've been recognizing some things that trigger my anxiety from day to day. Many of them revolve around my family, which I live with. The phone intercom in the house ringing, the certain notification warning from my cell phone, the sound of google home pinging to give me a broadcast, when my aunt is drinking heavily and voices start being raised.\n\nI feel a sudden rush of panic filling me, regardless of if there is a threat or not. I'll jump when the phone rings, I'll feel my hands shake when a fight, or a potential fight, starts breaking out between my mom and aunt, I get sick to my stomach when I'm in a situation that I'm afraid will lead to a fight, not a physical one, but a heated verbal one that can drag on for quite some time, and often finds me being the peacemaker or middle woman who has to help fix the situation. \n\nIt's because of this that my friends often tell me that I shouldn't be living with them, and some even offering me a place to live away from my family, an offer I accepted a few months back and am following through this weekend. \n\nBut still, the question swirls in my head, if what my therapist said in the first session was right. I've continued to see her since then, but it was only after my last appointment that I started to question this. I've asked my psychiatrist in my last appointment about that initial mention by my therapist about PTSD, to which he responded with 'a diagnosis at this point is entirely academic', which... just felt a little useless but reasonable. \n\nI'm expecting to talk with my therapist this Friday about it before my move, and I am going to bring it up, but it just kind of feels like an awkward question to ask a medical professional, and after the last time I brought it up I feel a little skittish, and I'm not sure how things will pan out in the moment of my therapist appointment.\n\nI know that this sub can't diagnose me, but I feel like this is something of a safe space where I can speak to people who would know. \n\n**tl;dr:** When I saw my therapist for the first time last year, after taking a questionnaire, she said I might have PTSD. I dismissed it, but a post I saw on reddit makes me question otherwise, noticing several things relating to my family that cause me anxiety, and even panic attacks. I have a therapist appointment on friday, but a recent appointment with my psychiatrist, where he absently dismissed a diagnosis of PTSD as being 'purely academic' has me nervous about bringing it up with my therapist."

Thankfully my regular doctor was there and he was brave enough to administer the drug into the oxygen that was being pumped into my throat - a less effective treatment that could have gotten him into trouble.   \nMy partner looks after my epi-pen at home and has warned me that if I have another attack he will use it on me. This is hard, just remembering its in the house somewhere gives me stress, but the worst thing is the thought of him being there when I'm suffering.\n\nThe thing I am scared of is associating *him* with my fear.

When I was 10 I was beaten every day by my parents and people who your supposed to trust I remember all of them every second of each punch, kick and being thrown.

I used the term \"My woman\" because I didn't want him to know her name.\nI hope the post works this time.\nI hope that some of you can relate and that it brings a bit of hope, among all the anger that infects us.\n\nDear Tom\nIt's been a long time since I've even thought about wanting to talk to you. For me, I never have to ask why that is; although the question of why you think that is, may be different. I wanted to write a letter to address that specific topic, as well a few other topics that have been on my mind for a long time. I've never felt like I could ever be open with you, there are a lot of reasons for it. I want to address these things in this letter and maybe, for the first time, you could actually get to know a little about me. You may think you know me, but I challenge you to even try to explain who i am, what i love, how i love. I know that you can't tell me these things because it has taken me decades to even understand them myself. I suppose we're all changing, some more than others, as time passes. For me it isn't any different.\n\nI wake up in the morning to the sunrise, it shoots through my curtains to greet me. I leave my woman and dog to sleep in and make my coffee, on time, every morning. While waiting, I lean against the counter and gaze out the back window. A field of green grass and trees beyond that, about a quarter mile down. I have a nice plot in amish country. All day long the clop-clop-clop of Amish wagons by the house. My house is small but respectable, it's an atomic-age rancher with updated interior and appliances. Every inch of this house is filled with our things, each of us having our own spaces, so we can share what we want but still have our little worlds. In the back we have about 300 varying herbs, flowers, and crops planted so far; she prefers the sweeter smelling herbs and I prefer the peppers. I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback that's a registered service animal. It's actually surprising just how smart a dog can be. Someone dumped off a broken lawn mower the other day, I had a good time bringing it back to life. Earlier this year, a coworker couldn't figure out how to fix his truck; i managed to do it for him. It's only work when you're not having fun, right? When i'm doing these things, i achieve a peace that i have rarely ever felt in my life.\n\nPeace is very important for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. My symptoms began around the age of 9 or 10. The depression was crushing. I also have had disassociative states, where entire days would pass and I wouldn't even notice. I guess the teachers started noticing that a student simply sat and stared for 8 hours without even uttering a word or opening a book. Besides that, was the fight or flight response that I would get from things that didn't make sense. I was so used to getting pounded or screamed at for simple things like asking a question or making a noise, that when I would be called on in school, I would become completely rattled. I never knew when the next attack from you would come, the anxiety kept me on edge and my nerves have been rattled my entire life because of that.\n\nI also had the anger to deal with. The only thing I understood about the anger was that it was always at myself, for being a failure. I hated myself, most of the time, for the first 20 years of my life. You never really took any interest in knowing what school was like for me; every now and then you'd ask \"how's school?\", as if that wasn't a rhetorical question. Any answer other than \"good\" would result in a melt down on your part and another attack; probably at some time that night, but I could never really tell. To say the least, because of this environment, my grades were never as good as they could have been. I was too busy wondering why I could never feel happy, talk to others, have fun. The closest thing I could compare to that was playing video games; but now I understand that in those stupid games I found a sense of peace. I was somewhere else in those games. A place away from you. Peace is important for people with PTSD.\n\nSo you might be wondering what PTSD actually is. Honestly, I don't blame you if you don't know. You probably have seen some of it or have heard of some of it in those who went through the universally despised Vietnam War. There's a lot more awareness now for this disease in this day and age because of the 18 years of war our country has gone through and for our ability to communicate instantly. Or maybe it's the fact that it's come to light that more than 20 of our heroes commit suicide every day due to this disease. It's more than 7000 a year, about twice the number we lost on 9\/11 and it has left my generation shattered and feeling lost. Even those who don't die, still suffer. Millions with drug problems, doing time that or for assault when they can't control this horrifying disease and it destroys what little they have left to love. But war PTSD is different from what I have for one main reason: before the years of combat, before the trauma, the victim knew what it was like to be \"normal\", then there was the trauma, and now they're not and will never be \"normal\" again. For me that's very different because I never knew what \"normal\" was. My earliest memories are of you abusing me. I never knew a life without anxiety or depression, so for me this has been a lifelong illness.\n\nThe affects of the disease can vary from person to person. While most experience nearly all the symptoms, the level of those symptoms can be different. The ones I most commonly experience are extreme anxiety, depression, nightmares, flashbacks, anger.\n\nI have nightmares most nights. I know this because I've been told by friends and girlfriends over the past 15 years or so that I act very strange in my sleep. Most of the time I don't remember them, but instead I wake up and vomit. Other times I wake up struggling, even throwing punches. Sometimes I hit my woman, and it hurts her. I feel like a monster when that happens. Every few months I'll have a dream that doesn't involve me being murdered or being powerless to stop those I care about from dying in some way, which is nice.\n\nMy anxiety is crushing. My hands permanently shake. Writing with a pen or pencil is almost impossible. There are times that ignorant people will say \"What's wrong with you?\". The anxiety has cost me many jobs. There are times when I'm at work, I feel completely surrounded and under attack for no apparent reason; I just have to leave. They usually fire me for this. I just have to get out of the building, away from everyone. Another thing about this is that i absolutely cannot have people touch me. Not even my woman touches me, I have to be the one to initiate contact. You can imagine how hard this is for someone who wants to get laid; thankfully my woman understands it and loves me regardless. There are also little things that my anxiety does to disrupt my life, like obsessingly checking locks to make sure no one is going to just barge into my house or my room and start beating on me or screaming at me. Or the fact that i cannot ever have a person stand behind me. In grocery lines I solved this by standing sideways. When this isn't possible, I leave.\n\nMy depression has dominated my life. I started hating myself at a very young age. I acted out on this by destroying my own possessions, I felt like i didn't deserve them for my failures. I've had problems with suicidal thoughts for a long, long time. For years, I kept a rope under my bed and a razor in my wallet, just in case. Just in case i'll have to end my life that day. Sometimes I would lie awake in bed, thinking about where and how I'll do it. I think about the fallout. I decided that using a gun was bad, because it would be rude to whoever found my corpse. I guess that puts things in perspective: when I care more about a stranger finding my corpse or cleaning crew having to come, than actually ending my own life. If you want to know what real depression is, maybe that would explain it for you.\n\nSince my diagnosis, I have come to understand why I am this way and what i can do about it. I surround myself with peace, but I'm always prepared for war. I have axes, knives, clubs and guns. For someone trying to find peace, I suppose it's ironic that there's always a need to be prepared to defend myself still. I hope that in the future i can feel safe without all these weapons, but I don't think that day will ever come.\n\nI'm not writing this letter just to talk about myself though, I wanted to talk about you and I as well.\n\nYou have always been a sort of mystery to me. When I would sneak into your room when you were gone, I was surprised to see that there isn't much there. A room so clean you can do surgery in it, it doesn't look lived in at all; but instead more like an Ikea display. So that didn't teach me anything. Around the house are generic things.. fake plants and every inch perfectly clean. Every piece of furniture, in it's exact place. The way it's always been. The only real material possessions you have are in the boxes in the basement. I went through them, trying to find out more. I found a lot of things, mostly photos. It occured to me that you never took any of them yourself. They were taken by others and put in a box by you and stored. I always wondered why they weren't put out like in every house I've ever been to. So I failed there too; I could only find a whisper of your past. The same was about my mother. You showed me a picture of her once. I ended up stealing a photo of her, it's the only one I have: a 2 inch square black and white passport photo. I always wondered why you just erased her, why I never heard about her. Growing up, because I lost her so young, I never felt like I had a mother. I had you, but I didn't even know you. You never really were a parent to me, more like a strange man who acted erratic and was completely unpredictable: either shower me in gifts no apparent reason or beat on me for no apparent reason. I do know that you're more learned than you let on, however. When you talk about technical things, I listened. It was the only times you weren't going off on a tangent, completely silent, or putting others down. You might be surprised to find out that unlike my brother, I don't have memory problems. Infact, I'm quite the opposite and likely to be on the autism spectrum because it's so unusual. So when it came to these details, I remembered them; and on numerous occasions people have been very impressed that i can rattle of technical details about random things like air conditioning or cars for example. Beyond that though, when you get right down to it, I never really knew you. We spent time together, which was a part of the bipolar way I was raised; where it actually seemed like you cared. We watched movies or would go hiking, but I didn't learn anything about you. So when it comes to having parents, I can't really say i've had the experience. I suppose the best thing you ever done in that field was reading to me and doing the voices the one year. That was A+ dadding. But before that was the abuse and after that was just endless abuse and neglect.\n\nYou used to say a lot of things to me that weren't true. It took me a long time to figure out that they weren't true, too. Apparently it's a scientific fact that children believe what they're told without asking questions a lot because it's the difference between the kids who got eaten by lions a hundred thousand years ago and those who didn't. So when it came to the things you'd say to me, like the really negative ones, I always believed you. You also kept me in the house, no after school activities, no friends over, no going out... this changed very slightly as I got to around 15, but not by much. I was often forced to stay in my room, many nights, sleeping on that mattressless bunk bed, wondering why I am such a piece of shit. You would always drop the line \"you're destroying this family\" as you would abuse me. As you would force me to take my clothes off and parade me infront of my siblings, as you would destroy my possessions, hit me, choke me, throw me down stairs; or just spend hours upon hours drilling it into my head that am neither loved nor wanted.\n\nBut now I understand that statement, as an adult, without a mind of a child. when you said \"you're destroying the family\"; what you meant was something different. \"Family\" didn't mean you and me and my siblings... how could bad grades destroy them? Or a spilled glass of water? Or staying up too late one night? No, \"Family\" meant you and your grip on controlling us. The grip you feared to lose because you were afraid of the government stepping in and providing for us. Not out of some altruistic feeling on your part, or some fear of a tyrannical NAZI government; but because it would mean you were a failure. Well, fearing failure is something you taught me well; however since you also taught me I'd never succeed at anything, you really fucked up my head in that sense too. So as I digress, what you really meant was \"you're destroying my ability to control you out of fear\" ... so the more I understand that statement now, the less it hurts me.\n\nYou'd also say \"I put a roof over your head\". This was very common. It didn't matter what the exact words were in this case, but the theme was important. \"I did my job, so now you owe me\". That's a part of your psyche in general, not just how you raised me. Whenever you give a gift, you have an ulterior motive. If that motive can't be fullfilled, you rage. You disappear. You hurt others. You claim that you're the victim, which is another common part of your psyche. If your ability to put people against one another, or to hurt and put down others is interrupted, then you're the one who was being hurt the whole time. I always thought the duality of your narcissism and playing the victim was ironic. Funny how you can throw a 4 year old down a flight of stairs, or beat on a 9 year old girl over and over again and claim at the same time that they were the one hurting you; and that you're awesome for fighting back to protect the \"family\".\n\nYou aren't just this way with your kids though, you're always this way. One factor i've always learned about you though is that when you're faced with a challenger, perhaps someone who isn't a child or a subordinate; someone who could kick your ass, you always back down. I grew up thinking you were strong because the mind of a child thinks what they're told. I now know better. Strength isn't hurting people, strength is helping people. Love isn't caging what you care about, it's about putting the pieces back together and making it better so it can be free. These things I never learned from you; I'd say I owe a debt to those who did teach me these things, but love doesn't collect on debt.\n\nI could go on for a thousand pages about what you've said. Some of my favorites are when you said you cancelled your life insurance because if you suddenly died, you wanted me to struggle. As though I really hated you so much or felt nothing for you that I would care more about the money than the fact I've become a fucking orphan. There was also the time that you taught me how to properly cut my wrists. The \"zig-zag\" style, you called it. then you gave me a knife. Wow, that's really great parenting, Tom.\n\nWords can hurt, but all of that doesn't quite compare to when I was 14, though. I got sick, remember? I mean, really sick. Pneumonia. It was bad. Fever of over 105, I couldn't walk, eat or drink. You did get around you taking me to a hospital, the next day. You threw me a wet, filthy, wash cloth from the sink and went to work instead that night. You always did this sort of thing. Tom, if you think for a second that i believe (or literally anyone else believes) that \"my kid is dying\" isn't a good enough excuse to call out, you're not even a good liar. You abandoned me. I suffered that night, it was bad. my brother was terrified too. he hates that you put him in charge, he wasn't ready for it. Looking back on that, and the other times you abused me, I can honestly say that it was different that time. The other times, I don't think you wanted me to die, but that time I'd have to say that I really think you did. It was attempted murder by intentional negligence. That's a pretty heavy sentence, Tom. Especially for a parent on their own child, and it would have been a quick trial too.. who are your character witnesses? Your traumatized children who ran off in their teens who have nothing but stories of abuse from you? Your brother and his kids who witnessed your abuse first hand, who you threatened to murder; even after they took you in their own home? That's 25 to life in prison, Tom. If you don't think for a second that I didn't consider pressing charges on you, you're even more arrogant than I thought.\n\nYou might argue that your love for me was in the things you bought me. I had a lot of toys; action figures, video games, a bike and eventually a car that i was allowed to use. One of the things about you though is that you there's always a reason for your \"gifts\". The toys were a way of saying \"sorry I bashed your head the other day\", or maybe \"please don't tip off the school officials about what I've done to you by being happy for a minute\". The car was a way of saying \"please disappear\". If you feel I misjudged you in this way, maybe you can explain why you did this for me and not my brother? Is it because you truly love me, or because you knew you could manipulate him and you got pleasure out that, and I was \"destroying the family\" so I had to go? Hell, the last time you messaged me, some 4 years ago, you wanted to go to a baseball game with me. OK tom, what's the catch? What do you want from me? This isn't an apology for what you did to me and my siblings or my mother. This isn't an apology for calling me a \"bad investment\" the previous time we spoke and I needed you. So what's your angle? I hope you're not so arrogant and self absorbed to think that I have a simple \"grudge\" against you or that I'm being unreasonably emotional. There's always a reason for your \"gifts\".\n\nSometimes you did things for outward appearances. Like when you made my lunch, you used to coach me on what to tell teachers. Lie, after lie, after lie. \"Nice lunch, too bad the fridge has been empty for 15 years\", \"nice lunch, why are you 35% under weight?\", \"nice lunch, why don't you talk to others?\", \"nice lunch, why do you go to the bathroom and cry?\". Those are the truths. Eventually you stuffed enough fried chicken down my throat and forced me to stay in my room that I got fat. Kinda hard to look malnurished and traumatized when you're fat, right? Appearances were very important to you. We had to look good. The rest doesn't matter. Grades were an important part of that, too. Not that you cared enough to help me, or to try to understand why abusing your kids doesn't help them do better in school. You never wondered why your kid couldn't read or write at the age of seven, or why he always got some letters backwards because he's dyslexic. It was just negative re-enforcement followed by occasional showering of gifts. Your only interest in \"raising\" me was holding on to your power to control others at all costs. Your only fear was that I would disrupt that control and \"destroy the family\".\n\nAnother inspiring and altruistic thing you'd do is lying to people about me. Remember the lies? I do. I was listening. You'd tell teachers that I had all these problems because my mother died when I was young. It was always the same story. You go to play the victim while being the predator at the same time, at the expense of my mother. That's an unbelievable act of psychotic evil that still astonishes me to this day.\n\nI tried to explain what it was like to be \"raised\" by you to a professional. She stopped me about a quarter of the way in and her face looked absolutely horrified. she wrote me four prescriptions and shuttled me out. Apparently just talking about it was too much for her to listen to. While it validates that I am in fact, not the bad guy, it at the same time makes the depression worse. How could a mental health professional not even want to listen to this? Either she thought I was lying and a nutcase for making it all up, or that it's all true and she wanted to quit her job because you're just that horrible. The pills didn't help, either.\n\nMoving forward, I have some plans. I have learned a lot, from those who care about me. I learned how to be impulsive. How to protect others. How to be forgiving. How to be understanding. How to accept others. I learned how not to destroy a family, but to build one. But by your definition of that ugly, evil phrase; I guess I had to destroy a family in order to build one. I had to disrupt your control of me in order to become something worth living.\n\nI'm not going to tell you what I am going to do with myself. You don't deserve that, even if you've changed your mind about wanting to actually know me in my absence. I will tell you how I'm moving forward without you though.\n\nOn days like this, when the sun shines through the curtains; my woman and my dog snore soundly. I wake up and make my coffee the same time as every day and I look out that window. I think about my garden, the herbs and potatoes and I think the smell of the stew my woman is going to make for me later; because she loves seeing me enjoy something she makes. I think about my father in law coming over with their kids and grand kids and how I'm going to work the hell out of that tiny grill. We'll talk politics or cars and play with the kids. My woman will compare tattoo art and shoot the shit about training PTSD service dogs. Or maybe my father in law will just show me how to loosen that rusted bolt on the mower; because that's what good fathers do. Not because I asked, but because he wants to teach me.\n\nI think about this and I'm surrounded by peace and love but I can't escape your words or your actions. They're so numerous, I could write a thousand pages of all the fucked up things you did and said to me and it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't be enough because as long as I wake up, covered in sweat on days like this; fearing for my life and angry at everything, I cannot escape what you did to me. It's taking years and I've given up on the medications. They were just covering it up, not fixing it. It turns that out I don't need antipsychotics, antidepressants, therapists. My therapy is a civil conversation, my antidepressant is working the dirt and my antipsychotic is having a laugh playing a board game with my family. This is my future now, and it won't be all great. We'll get sick, have problems, and we'll die; eventually. But the past doesn't rule my future, I know that now.\n\nIt's different for you, though. Because you're not getting any more chances from me. You hurt me again and again for 28 years and showed absolutely no remorse. Never an apology you actually meant. I used to think that hate was the opposite of love, but now I know that nothing is the opposite of love. You've proven to me again and again that you nothing me, so now I can say that I nothing you back. So when you think of me, there won't be a future. I'll always be in your past as you will always be in mine.\n\nThis letter might be addressed to you, but it's not really for you. It's for me. To close an ugly chapter in my life that was dominated by you. It's an open letter, I have no shame in being abused by you. I will not keep your secrets, not anymore. I guess i'll have to \"destroy the family\"."

She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She won't eat or drink in public. If she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone.

It's not something that's particularly weighing heavy on me, I just wanted some input. I'm a 23 year old male from Columbus, Ohio also.\n\nLast fall\/summer I was the victim of domestic abuse. My girlfriend at the time beat the shit out of me without any warning, it was my first and hopefully last time ever experiencing something of the sort and the fact that someone I loved so deeply could have did that was what really made it worse more than anything... It was only one time that this happened.\n\nThere's been a few times where I'll be laying in bed before I go to sleep and I'll see flashbacks of it and go into a panic attack. The way she breathed heavily before it happened, nearly hyperventilating. The way she marched up to me in silence and hit me square in the face... me repeatedly screaming at her to stop whilst trying to restrain her. It all would just come out right before bed but never during my day and these panic attacks maybe happened 2-3 times. This was in the first month after it happened and it hasn't really happened since... as time went on I accepted what happened. Or atleast thought I did...\n\nFast forward nearly 4 months. Just yesterday when I was at work, I was minding my own business doing my job when I heard a woman frantically yelling at somebody somewhere across the warehouse. It very much reminded me of the way my ex yelled at me the way she did that night when she assaulted me.. The type of loud yelling from a woman where their voice starts to grow hoarse from it while they're yelling. Idk it's hard to describe... but suddenly, I stopped what I was doing and began to shake and hyperventilate as those same flashbacks of that night I described started happening. I put my scanner down and went to the bathroom and had a panic attack on the floor.\n\nThe reason I'm not sure if it is PTSD is because it was just one instance where domestic violence occurred in my life, to me it could just be me still not being able to accept what happened. Normally you hear about the common case of combat veterans, rape victims or people who endured prolonged abuse in a relationship that develop PTSD but I feel like one instance of abuse like that shouldn't cause someone to develop it... or maybe it can. That's why I'm on the internet asking strangers about it. \n\nThoughts? And thanks for reading. "

        "text":"I am too scared to live my life how I want to. I know that the title seems dramatic, but please look at it in a literal sense. \n\n\\-Backstory Time\n\nMy mother was married four times, and her third husband, was addicted to pills. I didn't know it at the time, because he had been in my life since I was two, I just remembered being afraid of this man. He was 6'3 so being 8 (when the abuse started to get really bad) he looked and had this ..presence about him. You would get a feeling in the pit of your stomach in the same way that people afraid of heights would look up at a skyscraper. We moved around, a lot. 13 times in 10 years, mostly because he would lose his job because of his addiction to Oxycontin and Valium, he'd run out and not function. When his job prospects dried up, we moved. That marriage lasted 10 years. \n\nMy mother, who by the way has her own issues like bulimia, body dysphoria, and being bipolar didn't help, claims that she didn't know what was going on. If I did ANYTHING outside of what Jim (his name) thought I should be like, I was beaten, like if I glanced at the TV for a second before my chores were done, my mom would inform him and I'd get my ass handed to me. On the weekends, females stayed in the house and did housework, males went outside and did yard work. Females were to wear only pink or clear nail polish, and the boys only received military style haircuts. Cartoons were on Saturdays only, the day we had our GI Party, aka a General Inspection Party or for normal people, a cleaning day.  Everything was routine, anything falling out of line was ..taken care of. My mother acted like the Warden and He was the Judge, Jury and Punisher. \n\nI know, it doesn't sound too bad so far compared to what some people go through but when I turned 8 or 9, things got physical. He would drag me and my brother around the house by our necks, by my hair, choked us and stared us in the eyes while he screamed at us. I remember him throwing tennis shoes and glass ashtrays at me because I had a sinus infection and couldn't chew with my mouth closed. I cleaned my room, which Jim checked, and there was 1 sock on the floor, under my bed. He got in his truck and told me to go home, when I did, he started SCREAMING at me and TRASHING my room. He went through my stuff to see if I had a diary or something. I was a good kid, didn't do anything wrong (I was too afraid to) and we were poor, so no money (because of his addiction) to do anything. He was screaming that I was worthless (his favorite insult) that my father didn't even want me, and that I was a lesbian, the last one was kinda sprinkled throughout my life, which I'm not a lesbian. He also had two daughters who he cherished. This was a literal Cinderella scenario where my brother and I, although he won't admit it, were cinderella and they were the sisters with the big ass feet.\n\nMy mother on the other hand has enforced his rules and ideals. Kept his addiction a secret from EVERYONE, and she KNEW that I was being beaten and berated on an almost daily basis. She mocked my weight, if I was talking to her about something the conversation would morph into something about her or what's going on with her. That part is still true to this day. So after she and Jim finished their super ugly divorce, I became mom, she worked two or three jobs. I was in high school, making dinner, making sure homework was done for my three siblings, baths and then bed. Everyday. I didn't get to see friends outside of school and Jim would frequently call the house and YELL that I was a fucking fat lesbian d\\*ke and I wasn't worth the air I was breathing, saying that he would show up randomly and beat my ass if the house wasn't perfect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-It's all downhill from here folks.\n\nSo how do you think 16 year old me handled this? I had a nervous\/mental breakdown. I was in and out of hospitals for 2 years because of failed suicide attempts, I was in the oldest mental hospital in the state and they diagnosed me this PTSD. Shocker. I was put into foster care for 9 months because my mother didn't to deal with me, so I went to go live with my real father. That didn't turn out so well, his girlfriend framed me for stealing her makeup, which she was darker than me.. so.. yeah. He sent me back because it was easier for him. That was almost 10 years ago, and my mom is still trying to control me. I'm 25 and live with MY family, in our own house, with my own job, my fiancee's family basically adopted me. I have a 2 year old son and I decided that the cycle ends with me. No more abuse, or so I thought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Almost up to speed\n\nI have issues with who I am at this point. Growing up, I was told what to do and what I could look like. I walk on eggshells all of the time, and I'm terrified of making men angry. I feel like I just realized that I am out of prison but I'm too afraid to express myself in what I want. I'm always on edge, always on the defense and I even get emotionally and sometimes verbally abusive because I feel like people are out to manipulate me or get me to do something for their best interest. I studder and getting my feelings into words can be very difficult which cause disagreements to escalate. I get frustrated because I can't say a word and then, finally, it comes out aggressive and loud. It finally came to my attention that I was starting these arguments based on assumptions and paranoia. I ask if I'm going to be fired or demoted at work from time to time. \n\nIt was a week ago that I realized, other than the PTSD, that there's something else going on, that I am sick. I need help. I've tucked my pride away and I understand that my family deserves the best of me, and that I deserve to live without these mental shackles. I don't know why I can't let myself get a haircut or piercing or tattoo that I want. Buying things for myself can take a week unless it's a dire need. I can't be me, and I thought I was my own person, until I realized that I wasn't happy. I'm being walked all over at work, I just rolled with the punches. I feel like I'm awake and out of a trance or brainwashing. How do I know who I am? How do I know what my personality is? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR abused as a kid, trying to find out who I am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for reading guys, I feel a little better, feel free to inbox me or comment!"

I have a good relationship with them, but my step-dad can be very loud occasionally when he is frustrated about something or when he is telling a story. He has startled me and made me jump before when yelling at the dogs for their bad behavior. Anyway today he came home complaining about how people were acting at the store over all this coronavirus stuff (fair enough), but he got really worked up telling the story and described a fight he saw, basically yelling the story at me. \n\nI immediately tensed up, kind of disassociated and got quiet in hopes to just end the conversation. The conversation did end, very awkwardly. I couldn't explain to him that his tone and demeanor was scaring me, because I did not want to go into that. \n\nI used to think my PTSD came from my more recent unhealthy relationships, but I have done a lot of healing to work through those and have a pretty positive perspective on developing future relationships. However, I still have PTSD triggers that come up here and there. The only thing I can think is that when I was growing I felt that he secretly disliked me or judged me, and at my dad's house, my step-mom was outwardly judgmental towards anything I said or did, so I was afraid to stir the pot. I stayed very quiet and calm, in order to avoid confrontation. It felt like trying to avoid stepping on a bomb, like tension was building and it could explode at any moment. There were moments here and there where it did explode. Even though those moments were few and far between, they stuck with me and kept me in a fearful place. \n\nEven now, I have this fear that he secretly hates me and wants me to leave. I constantly wonder if this is my own insecurity or if I am picking up on a real feeling he does not want to admit. Anyway, getting pretty deep into the rabbit hole of my brain. I just wanted to vent about this. This feels like such a small, stupid trigger, but it made me realize how much fear I still harbor.\n\n...Might be time to move out! Lol."

I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.\n\nI tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.\n\nI just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? \n\nA few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier\/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.\n\nI feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. \n\nI think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future. I just want to be ok. :( "

After my surgery, a hole appeared in the floor of my mouth. A surgeon came into my 6 bed bay at 2am and using local anaesthetic stitched up the floor of my mouth by a flashlight that her assistant was holding, she stabbed me through the lip (which wasn't numbed) a couple of times and the next day I found out she hadn't done it properly and still had a hole. The surgeon  wanted me to go under General and get it sorted but I was too scared and so let it heal naturally which took 3 weeks on NG tube which made me sick. I have bad veins also and was stabbed numerous times every day by people trying to find veins for canulars or to take bloods. 2 doctors gave me a nose bleed because they were trying to very forcefully shove a large NG tube that was the wrong size up my nose. My dietician  restricted my water and I had severe dehydration headaches all weekend while she was off and no one would up my water intake because her word is law or whatever. Anyway long story short, it was a lash up and lots of horrible things happened to me along with just trying to deal with getting cancer and going through treatment. So since then I have nightmares every night, I can't sleep, I grind my teeth all day getting angry at how (I've tried) but can't get any help for what happened to me and psychological help. So it didn't really click until I went for an eye test and they did the glaucoma air pressure test and I completely broke down. I was so embarrassed because the lady doing it clearly didn't get it, it's only a burst of air to the eye, it doesn't hurt. Which I get.

She\u2019s mentioned that she can\u2019t trust me as much anymore and I\u2019m worried I hit a trigger (her abusive ex use to break up with her and her back together with her consistently). I\u2019m actively working on learning more about ptsd and being understanding and loving but there are bad days and good days. We compromised and made a cot in a spare room for days when her ptsd is particularly bad and she doesn\u2019t want any kind of touch. We have decided to start working on ourselves and enjoying things we once did again; my photography and her art to start with. Would love to know recommendations on how I can be a loving partner to an amazing woman that just happens to have ptsd"

Hi! \n\nI appreciate whoever is reading this right now, it means a lot to me.\n\nI still care a lot about my ex. I know a lot of people would say stay away, they\u2019re not your issue anymore but I simply cannot leave them because I care.\n\nMy ex has been through a lot. Child abuse, job at 15 to pay off the house, texts from her dad all the time after he left about how much he hates her, sexually assaulted twice, sexually abused, physically abused, abortion, etc.\n\nIs there any advice out there, I would gladly take any. I had issues with fully understanding her situation, but I really want to be able to know what to do when she gets into a bad headspace and everything. Everyday is so sad for her and I\u2019m not sure how to be there for her. \n\nI listen to everything she says and give her validation but I\u2019m not really sure what to do after that. I\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s not in pain, be there in person when she needs me, and everything I could try.\n\nBut there must be something I can do.

        "text":"From ok to 0 in about 2 seconds I have a bunch of traumatic things that have happened to me while I was growing up (sexual abuse from family members, a long-term emotionally abusive relationship that has thankfully ended, and continually high pressure from my family to perform and has been very verbally abusive).\n\nPreviously I\u2019ve been able to cope extremely well and sort of swept all of this under the rug. I graduated in the top 1% of my state, graduated in the top 10% of my medical school, and had previously set myself up really well to follow my new life\u2019s dream or pursuing anaesthesiology. I had also found who I believe to be my life partner, who is amazing.\n\n2 months ago I had elective surgery, which was extremely traumatic for me from the start and essentially the control behind organising it all was taken away from me. Essentially I had very little say about what happened and the surgeon belittled me. I believe this has set off ptsd (I\u2019m seeing therapists but they haven\u2019t put down a diagnosis yet) as I\u2019m getting nightmares and very distressing flashbacks about everything traumatic in my past. I\u2019ve had to stop work for the moment because I can\u2019t cope.\n\nI am currently extremely distressed because a bunch of my trauma happened in my family home and I cannot afford to move out by myself. My partner\u2019s home is slightly better but his dad is always home, and it unsettles me because he is an older male and I subconsciously do not trust him.\n\nIt\u2019s father\u2019s day tomorrow. My dad came home with a new piece of technology. He has previously always asked me for help and more often than not yelled at me either out of frustration or because it looks like I haven\u2019t put in enough effort to help. Either way, he takes him frustration out on me. And when I was growing up, it\u2019s occurred to me recently that he has been a continual source of trauma through his unrealistic expectations (even though I managed to time and time again meet them) and vicarious life through me because of an unresolved inferiority complex and his own trauma. My mother is a refugee, which carries a hell of a lot of psychological issues in itself. Neither of my parents have sought any psychological help or therapy, and so you can imagine what sort of a household we have. My partner brought up today that it seems that my family just don\u2019t resolve any issues. And it\u2019s true. For all the times my dad has yelled and abused me, whether it be because I didn\u2019t attain the highest music diploma the first time (at age 15), being accused of lying about my exit high school mark (which ended up being in the top 1%), not being accepted straight into medical school after high school, and not being happy with dentistry instead on a scholarship (only a few examples), I can count on one hand the number of times he has apologised. Everything is swept under the rug. And for my mother, she has lost control of many things, so the only thing or person she can control is me. And it\u2019s taken a full toll on me.\n\nThe relevance is this: today I was feeling good because I hadn\u2019t felt suicidal in 12 hours, which is actually an achievement for me these days. As I said before, for father\u2019s day my dad brought home this new watch. I could sense myself being triggered so I left the house quickly and as soon as I was in the car, every flashback of my dad\u2019s abuse growing up haunted me and I just couldn\u2019t shake it. I have absolutely lost it. I feel like a victim and so fucking frustrated because previously I was so high functioning. My future was clearly set out and I was going places. And now I\u2019m on the absolute opposite end of the table. I\u2019m terrified about my future and whether I\u2019ll ever be able to work as a doctor again. I have fallen in love with helping people even more since this has happened, but for now I\u2019m far too unwell to work. I am ashamed to tell the majority of my friends (1) that I have stopped working for now and (2) the immediate reason for this (even though I know it was just the trigger - this was probably bound to happen at some point). I am filled with resent, and so fucking frustrated that my new major goals for each day include just forcing myself to get out of bed. I have intense suicidal thoughts every day. Everyone says it will get better, but my baseline evidently wasn\u2019t that good to start with. My parents don\u2019t take my mental health issues very seriously (my psychiatrist knows my dad and told her that this was all stemmed from vanity from my surgery, which I realise now is 100% absolute fucking garbage, and my mother decided to joke about it one day).\n\nRight now I don\u2019t feel safe and I don\u2019t know what to do. This post didn\u2019t really have a question - I am just massively triggered right now and want to vent my story anonymously. Thanks for reading."

I have also been dissociating really badly, as in constantly, for the past few months because I was triggered badly right before.

I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.\n\nI tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.\n\nI just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? \n\nA few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier\/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.\n\nI feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. \n\nI think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future. I just want to be ok. :( "

I've been posting on reddit before about my severe anxiety and fear of psychosis.\n\nBut still, as a background note:\nI am a 23 year old woman, currently unemployed, with no history of psychosis\/schizophrenia in my family, but with history of trauma (bullying, abusive father, parental divorce, neurological illness of my twin brother). I'm currently living with my mother and twin brother.\n\nSo, because of the whole covid quarantine, I engaged in online therapy. I contacted a clinician psychologist  via a mental health website following a video evaluation and a series of tests for diagnosis. \nAfter all of them, I scored very high in most anxiety disorders which are: PTSD (highest), health anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and OCD.\nI also did a psychosis test which came out with 0 points result, meaning that I have no hallucination or delusion.\nShe adviced me to continue talk therapy and (optional) medication but accentuated the talk therapy. \n I'm currently still trying to save some money for the upcoming sessions so right now I can't attend them.\n\nThe thing is this: for the past month I've been dealing with derealization and been stuck inside my head all day.\nI have a huge fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia after accidentally coming across on google while searching for symptoms of dissociation.\n\nAs mentioned, I don't have hallucinations or delusions, but I experience some things maybe related to my PTSD. For example:\n- when my brother doesn't answer my phonecalls I get a panic attack and racing thoughts about something terribly happening to him (he is diagnosed with epilepsy).\n- I tend to avoid songs, places, movies, topics that remind myself of my trauma experiences, otherwise I think they might reoccur.\n- I have a tic that's lip picking, when i'm stressed or bored.\n- I have agoraphobia due to a traumatic event when I passed out 5 years ago (due to hypoglycemia) and always go out feeling tense and stuck in my head.\n- when I get derealization, I struggle to focus on my surroundings and my speech.\n- when I send a text to a friend or say something that might upset them, I think about that a lot of get scared of them wanting to distance from me (it happens only ocasionally, but it's still concerning me).\n- being stuck in my head, I became a bit less responsive to conversations with my family.\n\nMy traumas were triggered when I was 9,13,14 and 18.\nEver since the evaluation, I began to think a little more clear about my mental state but I still have the psychosis themed fear and the idea of losing my mind or losing control of myself terrifies me.\nIn the past year my self esteem has been very affected, I don't feel in control of myself and feel like I lost my independent life; I feel the need to rely on my mother and brother. Before that, I used to trust myself and my mother and brother relied on me too. They still do, but I feel like I'm the one who can't rely on myself.\nAll of this happened after getting the psychosis fear.\n\nI read somewhere that PTSD can come with secondary psychosis in a much higher rate than in general population and it scared me badly considering my phobia.\nI feel like I need more information on this, as my fear convinces me that because I have PTSD, I might get psychosis too.\nAre there any important details about this? Does psychosis in PTSD manifest the same way as in regular psychosis? Why do some PTSD sufferers develop it and other PTSD sufferers don't?\nDoes my personal case suggest I might develop psychosis?"

        "text":"I think I have PTSD and I don't know where to start | TW for descriptions of sexual abuse\/animal Abuse Hi! Long-time lurker, first-time poster to this subreddit. \n\ntl;dr - spent more time being looked after by day-cares than my home, dealt with some fucked up things and I'm not sure what to do or if it's even worthy of direct help. Looking for advice.\n\nI've been seeing a therapist for general anxiety, OCD and depression, as well as treating ADHD and some learning disabilities. I have no idea how to breech this subject with my therapist because I feel like I've already dumped a bunch on her and I feel like I'm just asking for attention at this point. \n\nBasically, I have a specific old memory from my childhood that haunts me every single day. I was a military kid of a single mom, and spent a lot of time away from her and was looked after by babysitters, was placed in daycares, etc. I don't resent her at all - I love my mom with everything I have! She was my whole world and still is. It was very difficult to have to be separated from her and I wound up in the care of mean or neglectful babysitters and a few day-cares where I had some gross encounters. TW details to follow:&gt;!I know I was sexually abused by a handful of older kids several times at a particular day-care (Mom DID learn about this and tried to do something but didn't\/couldn't pull me out of the daycare), and I know I had a minor situation happen with a cousin during a period my mother wasn't mentally well and they were visiting\/looking after me (Mom DOESN'T know about this, I don't want to tell her). The memory that TRULY haunts me during this period of my life is from a particular babysitter's home. We (4-5 other kids) were left alone all the time in the babysitter's basement. There was another child who was 2 or 3 that they looked after, and he fatally abused several of the babysitter's pets while we were left alone. I was 5 or 6 and could do  nothing but watch. I blocked it out until I was 10 and owned a pet - that's when I'd say it truly began to haunt me. I didn't tell my mother until a few weeks ago, and I was even more vague talking about it than I'm being here.!&lt;\n\nI pushed this event aside as an intrusive thought and told myself it was nothing more, but it HAUNTS me. DAILY. It feels like I'm there. For a split second I hear things, I feel things, I see everything, it takes over my vision, my bones, my guts, I feel physically and emotionally for the animals. I gasp, I plug my ears, I cry, I panic. At home alone or in public, on the bus, at work. And it loops like my other intrusive thoughts. I think about it once and it takes minutes or hours to cool off. When things IRL remind me of it (area carpets, certain animals, roadkill, certain gestures), it's like I'm FORCED to think about it again. I'm freaking my husband out with it lately, I know. I had to open up to him about it recently because it flaired up a few weeks ago and I was crying in bed and it was torture because it is so incredibly difficult to talk about it. \n\nSubconsciously I know a lot of my current issues are because I was left alone with strangers so much as a child and I kept a lot of went on from my mom when I could. Compared to other people's stories I feel ashamed posting here looking for direction, and as badly as I'd like to talk to my therapist about this, I don't know if it's worth it. It's not like she can do anything about the memory itself, right? It's not like my other intrusive thoughts that are purely fictional. This is something that happened and nothing can change it. But I can't handle this plaguing me anymore. \n\nI want help and I have no idea if THIS is even the best place to start. \n\nI appreciate any advice. Thanks so much if you read the whole thing and hope it's okay to post this."

After I told a friend I had been assaulted he tried to be supportive over text but stopped wanting to see me in person (he claimed he was really busy with work but it was kind of a thin excuse as it mostly applied just to seeing me, not anyone else). While its gotten a little better recently after I kind of told him I was upset that I had rarely seen him in months and that I thought it was linked to disclosure, I still feel like things arent the same anymore and it feels like the whole friendship is on thin ice. He's normally a pretty emotionally supportive person but I realize this kind of thing can be taken really differently. I still feel like there is this underlying tension, probably because he still says its because work was and has been really busy and so while I see him more often now (but not as often as before I said anything) i feel like the same thing can happen again at any moment if I do or say the wrong thing (like mentioning or alluding to assault at all).\n\nThis ever happen with anyone else? Advice on how to deal with friend?\n\nAnd advice about how to deal with the impact of this on myself? Self-esteem hit new lows and had already felt really humiliated about assault before and wanted to tell friends to stop feeling so bad about it and to be able to talk to someone on days when my PTSD got really bad. But now I feel even more humiliated about it and feel like anyone that knows is going to see me as damaged, so theres a lot of shame. I'm also terrified to talk to anyone else about it. I had told one friend over skype and she was supportive over text as well and didn't stop texting me or anything like that but I havent talked about it to her at all in person since she moved to the same city as me so I guess a part of me is worried she'd react the same way (not wanting to see me in person) even though she hasnt done anything like that. \n\n**TL;DR how do you deal with friend that suddenly feels uneasy around you after disclosure of trauma\/ptsd? How do you keep it from making you feel bad about having ptsd or telling anyone else about it, especially on really bad days when u really need some semblance of support?**"

I'm not sure whether talking with her on the phone or through some videoconferencing application (such as Skype) would be something you could do in the meantime until you sort out what you want to do.Some things I wonder are:What makes the two of them not get along?What makes him feel threatened or on edge if you visit your mother without him? What does he think will happen?What is he getting out of trying to choose for you?What is he so afraid of?If you decide to talk about these things with your boyfriend, try to do the following:Consider using questions that start with the words who, what, where, when, and not why. The word why can be really difficult for some people to answer because the word itself triggers an emotional reaction.Try to ask him if the two of you can discuss this in a way that you can just ask more questions about what he is experiencing. If you can listen without being defensive about what you think and feel, you may understand more about where you boyfriend is coming from.Remember that understanding what he means does not mean that you have to agree with what he is saying.Maybe he would be willing to listen to what you are experiencing and ask questions about that as you did for him. It would be good to do this in a way similar to what an investigative reporter would do and asking questions that cannot be answered in a yes or no format and require more information.I'm sure this is putting you in a very tough place. If you would like to talk to someone more directly about the details, consider seeing a local mental health professional."

Everyone tells me how much EDMR helped lessen the severity of their PTSD but it doesn\u2019t work immediately, right? So after that first session when I\u2019ve just recalled everything I\u2019d be extremely at risk, right? But on the other hand if I keep avoiding this treatment then the PTSD will never stop.\n\nI don\u2019t have any friends or family nearby who can babysit me. I\u2019m in the US so I don\u2019t get time off work and I can\u2019t afford hospitalization. I\u2019m worried that if I bring up this concern that I\u2019ll be involuntarily committed. \n\nNot to mention that part of my PTSD comes with a complete distrust of hospitals, doctors, nurses, all of it. I can only trust hard data from actual test results which has already led to a statistically unwarranted biopsy that I needed to get or else I\u2019d lose my mind but who knew you had to be awake for biopsies?! They messed up the procedure and I had to hear the whole conversation that basically went \u201coops we need to get another doctor in here to fix this\u201d and I could feel all the blood running down my ribs and it\u2019s like, what the actual fuck doctors truly are idiots. If I didn\u2019t have so much experience cutting I\u2019m sure the incision thing would have f\u2019d me up too. The lump was benign.\n\nThe PTSD isn\u2019t too bad if I just avoid everything but mornings are rough from nightmares and trying to reconcile my reality again.\n\nSo I guess my question is for people who got EDMR: how did you feel after the first time?"

While this happened my grandfather(abuser) frequently visits and calls almost everyday. I get panic attacks everytime it's brought up or if I'm reminded of it in some way...

But I can no longer afford medication or therapy so I\u2019ve been skating by basically.\n\nAs a kid, my family gaslighted me into thinking I was a walking disaster. If something broke, it had to be my fault. If I injured myself, obviously it was in character for me.

It was normal in my family for my siblings to break something, blame it on me, and I got the beating and verbal lashing despite my proclaimed innocence.\n\nSo yesterday I had a cooking disaster. I damaged an expensive piece of cookware - but only aesthetically. It still works fine but it is no longer beautiful. I told my husband because it triggered me.

I get emotional, \u201cI know, I know! I feel guilty enough!\u201d But I raised my voice so he started yelling back. I don\u2019t even remember what he said but I felt like he was speaking to a bad dog and not his wife.\n\nWe reconciled some time later but the spiral started.\n\nThis morning we had a fight. I have a migraine and a lot of work to do. He kept talking to me while I was writing and it made me irritable. So I took a break to watch tv with him. He kept talking during the show. The show + his voice + my migraine made me feel like I was going to lose my mind. I couldn\u2019t process anything. Construction started outside. I reminded my husband that he had to pause if he needed to talk. I asked him to shut the window. \n\nHe lost it and started yelling at me again. That he couldn\u2019t stand my mood. I started crying again, that I couldn\u2019t process all the sounds and he knows this. He just kept yelling that I was bossy, selfish, I had a bad attitude.\n\nI left the room and locked myself in the bedroom. He keeps yelling and slamming the doors. Huge huge trigger.\n\nNow I\u2019m scared and hiding. I have to shower. He\u2019s mad at me and not coming to comfort me. I don\u2019t want to see him and I\u2019m afraid of having to talk because I just feel mute. I have to go to work soon.  I love him\nBut I don\u2019t feel like I love him right now. I feel like he has been pretending to understand my ptsd. I know I wasn\u2019t rude. I know I don\u2019t deserve the yelling\n\nI feel like a scared teenager again and I don\u2019t know what to do. I have to go to work"

        "text":"PTSD from another\u2019s experience Trigger warning for sexual content, BDSM, similarities with pedophilia, mention of parental abuse, mention of suicide\n\nTo give a little background, I (23F) was abused my by dad for the first 6 years of my life, physically and verbally. A family member mentioned something about possible sexual abuse, but this topic is very avoided by our family, so it\u2019s never discussed. \n\nMy older brother (29) was seriously affected by the abuse he endured, and now has his own set of struggles and problems he faces as an adult. This includes uncontrollable anger, violence to his girlfriend, screaming, throwing things (anything from a mug to a dinner chair) around when things don\u2019t go his way, threatening suicide, and more. I lived with him and my mom for a few years like this and this caused me to be very sensitive to noise, particularly made by men. I don\u2019t live with them anymore. I have been afraid and wary of men for my whole life, and part of me wants to keep it that way for my safety even though I know it causes me a lot of pain in my every day of life.\n\nWithout getting too into details, my long distance girlfriend (22) visited a BDSM dungeon to learn what it was about and instantly had a 70 year old man infatuated with her. He invited her to his house to teach her, and I strongly discouraged her from going. After an impact play session at the dungeon and some time, she asked me if she could go to his house for more sessions because he wanted it so badly. We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. \n\nThis man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn\u2019t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He\u2019d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.\n\nOne of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend\u2019s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. \n\nHe continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me. I already had an extreme aversion to the idea of sex with men, especially old men, and I couldn\u2019t handle that. I messaged my girlfriend that night that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch any more of their sessions.\n\nSome time passed, she had one or two more sessions with him (I tried to think about it as little as possible while it was going on so I wasn\u2019t keeping count), and my girlfriend moved for school in early fall. After a while, I believed that he was in the past and wouldn\u2019t be a problem again. Eventually, my girlfriend and I discussed this and she realized how creepy this situation actually was, and she felt extremely uncomfortable with how familiar this old man was with her body. We agreed that we shouldn\u2019t have contact with him anymore and she told him this politely in a text. We tried to move on together and leave this in the past.\n\nAnd then he posted photos of her body on a BDSM website without her consent. She asked him to take it down, he refused. After a whole night of pleading him to take it down, we reported it and it disappeared. A couple days later, he posted it again. She got in contact with the dungeon she met him at, which he was actually longterm volunteer for, and they were able to get the photo down and promised my girlfriend they\u2019d keep an eye on his profile and that they\u2019d deal with his situation with the dungeon.\n\nTLDR: Creepy 70 year old man consistently pushes my girlfriend\u2019s and my boundaries during BDSM impact play session and then posts photos of my gf\u2019s body in retaliation of my gf telling him she doesn\u2019t want him in her life anymore.\n\nNow I have an extreme on-sight reaction to any old man even slightly similar to this man. I feel like I\u2019m going to collapse and cry and freak out the second I visually process an old man. The biggest problem is that I work at a drugstore and there are LOTS of old men who use the store. I\u2019m terrified of them and I don\u2019t know how long I can handle these extreme responses I have to seeing them. Nearly of my trauma related reactions have funneled into this and it\u2019s more extreme than anything I\u2019ve experienced before.\n\nThankfully, I will be started EMDR therapy soon, and I really really hope to see improvement one day. I think I might need to quit my job. I feel like I\u2019m going to die when I have to ring up an old man, I can barely speak to them and I can\u2019t look them in the eyes. I\u2019ve cried throughout typing this and I am so scared about going back to work every single day.\n\nDoes it make sense that my triggers and reactions changed so much just by this situation I didn\u2019t even experience firsthand?"

        "text":"Has anyone's appetite actually increased after PTSD? TW: ED I had an eating disorder as a teenager that ran until I was around 21. It went from restricting myself at 14 to only eating \\~1000 calories a day to binging and purging weekly for the next 8 years. 6 months before my trauma, I decided to end it. I started eating more and healthier and lifting weights instead of the \\~80 minutes of cardio a day I was doing. I felt amazing.\n\nThen the trauma happened, and fitness was one of the interests I lost when the depression and PTSD hit. I couldn't sleep and had a very busy schedule, so I relied on (mainly junk) food to get me through all-nighters and long shifts. This turned to a comfort thing where I would down Ben and Jerry's and blame my depression. I couldn't even go back to doing cardio because an elevated heart-rate felt like a panic attack. Unsurprisingly, I gained 15 pounds, which is a lot on my 5'1 body.\n\nIt's been a year and some months, and I'm safe again. I have my degree, a job, my own apartment, and stability. Yet all I want to do is lose this weight I gained. I associate it with the worst year of my life and everything in me wants to just go back to the \"old me\" before the trauma and, in hand, the weight gain. Yet I'm so scared this restriction is going to lead to my eating becoming disordered again.\n\nI have tried dieting, but I can't get myself to use calorie tracking apps and when I get too hungry I just...eat. I don't think about my allotted macros for the day or if I'm above or below my protein goal or if the food I'm eating \"fits in my macros\" anymore. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating with no restrictions and I still have my daily fruits and veggies. I'm also still very into weight-lifting and go to the gym 6 days a week still. I guess I just don't have the passion to diet and exercise like I used to for weight loss, though.\n\nI hear all the time about people with PTSD not eating and withering away because of the traumatic event they had to endure. Has anybody else experienced the opposite, though- relying on food to cope? It's hard for me to relate to most stories about PTSD because so many talk about experiencing nausea and an inability to eat - but the only thing I cared about after my trauma was eating. Maybe my history of heavy restriction caused my appetite increase after the trauma as a way of preventing myself from going down that path again. I don't know."

Background on me: PTSD diagnosed , childhood trauma, I don\u2019t remember a lot of my childhood and continue (as an adult) to go into black out mode when things get tough. I am a virgin who plans to stay one till marriage because of sexual trauma. \n\nI dated a guy for three months who lied a lot. It was the peak of my drinking problem (70 something days sober). I would get black out drunk with my ex boyfriend. He would drink nothing. I would go in my room thinking I passed out but we would still do sexual things that was not sex. Remember I am a virgin. \n\nOne night I got so drunk I don\u2019t remember making it to bed. He knew how much I drank. He never said anything. If anything encouraged by buying alcohol for me and my roommate. I woke up the next day with awful vaginal pain. When I peed it felt like my insides were ripped and I had blood in my urine. That lasted for three days before slowly fading away. When I asked my ex about it he said he used three fingers and that\u2019s why. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. \n\nI got drunk a few more times but not blackout and we do things again. I try to set boundaries with him about it realizing I needed to and he texted me \u201cI didn\u2019t rape you\u201d I didn\u2019t think anything of it because rape is such a triggering thing. I shut it down super quick. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is rape or not because when I would get drunk I would ask to have sex but he would say no. He knew I wanted to wait and he wanted to be a good boyfriend. But the three finger excuse didn\u2019t make sense because we consensually used that many before and it didn\u2019t feel that way. I didn\u2019t feel torn and I didn\u2019t bleed. Do you think he waited till I was so unconscious to do something? I didn\u2019t bring up rape in the text but he jumped right in like he was ready to defend himself. I understand it\u2019s a rough accusation but I don\u2019t understand why he jumped to it.  \n\nDo you think this sounds like rape?"

Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you.  People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on.  In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a \u201cself\u201d outside of this relationship can be unhealthy.  It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship.  Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read.  One is Codependent No More.  The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable.  You cannot change her and cannot change her mind.  Sometimes the best thing is to let go.  If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again.  It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving.  I suggest backing off and letting her go.  Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind.  If it is meant to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own."

Real, real, real fucked up, eerie, mind-bending shit here. \n\nBut since I have no insurance, and barely any money, it seems like there's nothing I can do about it. \n\nWhat a fate this is, eh. Realistically I should be dead right now, but I survived because of a variety of rare reasons and some luck. \n\nBut it's apparently not enough, because only people with money deserve to live. Even though I have an education, skilled, talented... if you go down here, you're down forever if you don't have a family to help you back up. I sure as hell don't.\n\nIs there any hope I can find something?\n\nThank you!"

        "text":"How do you deal with new and unexpected trauma? TW: Loss of friendship, depression, anxiety, low key suicidal, emotionally broken, sexual discomfort Trigger warning: \nLoss of friendship, depression, anxiety, low key suicidal, emotionally broken, sexual discomfort\n\nI don't know if the stuff I'm about to write is actually triggering, but I'd rather post a warning too many than too few. \nThere is no violence or physical\/real life confrontation in the post to come. It took place via chat. \n\nHey all. First time here - let me start by saying thank you for having this community. \nI am sorry my first post is gonna be jumping right in and asking for help, but I have nowhere else to turn. \nMy friends can only do so much and my therapy sessions are cancelled for at least 2 weeks as my entire country is on lockdown of all non-essential things. \n\n\nSo, here goes. \n3 days ago was a day as days normally are. Get up, eat some, whatever else. \nHowever, completely out of the blue I get a message from a guy I considered my best real life friend. A guy I have had movie weekends with, making costumes, crafting jewellery, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a lot of hugging and a ton of common interests. \nI'm not exaggerating when I'm saying this guy might be the best part about my daily life in real life(except for the hobbies that keep me busy and alive). \nIn the message, less than 2 weeks after we hung out, laughed, talked and hugged, he wrote to me that he realized it was gonna seem like thunder from a clear sky, but he didn't feel comfortable around me anymore and because he was unable to tell me when something was crossing a boundary of his he had to end our friendship effective immediately. \nThe behaviour he was triggered by was what I considered normal jokes. Normal jokes with awcual undertones, pretty normal stuff. But what I didn't know was that he has a traumatic past that made such jokes incredibly uncomfortable to him and he never told me I was crossing his boundaries so I did not see it coming a mile away, especially since he and I had been together and had fun shortly before then. \n\nI cried for several hours, just looking at my computer at nothing, crying and wiping my face. When I was done crying I started imagining what I was gonna do now. And the thought of suicide entered my mind and presented itself as a logical option to solve all my problems. I don't think I'm gonna make an attempt, in my 30 years I haven't ever, but the fact that the thought entered my mind and seemed like a reasonable option scared me. \n\nI made it through the day. And I slept. But things didn't get better. \nSince then I've been unable to find the motivation to live. I am a hobby artist and usually I am so passionate and active that I forget to go to bed and sometimes remember that I haven't showered for 2 days. Gross, I know, but that should say something about the magnitude of my obsession with my hobbies. \nFor the last 3 days I have done none of it. I have been immersing myself in a large computer game to disconnect from reality. I have a constant sadness and it feels like my entire body is slugging through a hot, dry environment but without being dry. My chest feels like it's being compressed. Whenever I stop and let my mind rest my pulse starts racing and I feel an overwhelming anxiety. \nAnd since then I have hated myself and my own sexuality to the point where just thinking about sexual desires or activity will make me nauseated, guilty, sad, angry and deeply uncomfortable. \n\nHow do you all deal with being traumatized like this? I was already fragile, but I was making real progress. Now it feels like I've been dragged 5 years back, like being pulled backwards into a vat of icy water, struggling to get back up. \nI don't remember the last time I felt this broken. I feel like I've lost everything. And I have no idea what to do. \n\nThank you for reading this. And thank you for letting me share."

It was a few months ago and I had flashbacks for a while and nightmares, not about the event specifically but I i knew it was related. \n\nLately I\u2019ve just been having this feeling of general unease, especially when I\u2019m home alone. I feel like someone is watching me. My skin crawls. I feel hot all over like I have a fever but I don\u2019t. I find it very difficult to walk past that spot in my house at night alone. \n\nThis isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve experienced before.

It doesn\u2019t happen when my family is home or when I\u2019m with friends or out of the house. \n\nHas anyone else gone through this?

I think some of us feel for people more than most, having survived our own worst nightmares. And it can take a toll on our personal wellbeing. \nMy daughter went out to the bar with her friends Saturday. First time without mama there. But, her best friend's dad works in the kitchen. Big tough (but sweet) guy everyone knows and respects. Her other friend's dad was there watching out for her. She was with the two most responsible 21 year olds I know, her best friend &amp; her protective boyfriend, who I love like my own. She was less than a minute from our house! My nervous mommy-heart tried to rest assured, she was safe. And, she was.\nBut. A 20 year old kid, not a local, was here for labor day. He was staying in a summer cottage by the lake. There are 2 bars on my road. He, with the big holiday crowd, managed to slip into the bars, looking for a girl. He came up to the kids' table, chatted and asked if they'd seen her. He left on foot. Mag and her friends left the bar after 3. That kid was dead within the hour, found unresponsive on the road near the last bar. They had JUST talked to him!! It was initially believed he was the victim of a drunken driver, hit and run. But now, there are more questions. Cause of death is pending autopsy. The kids are devastated. My town is upside down. Her friend worked there that night in the kitchen &amp; joined them after. She worked last night as well, came here in tears, just heart torn. My babies are hurting and I can't bear it! And the world feels that much more dangerous. So difficult to ever feel the same. She was safe..\nAnd..where one of my best friends lives, a 2 year old was hit by a car and killed. This on the tail of a 10 year old murdered, strangled by her stepmother, all this weekend in the same area.\nI'm shook. Anxiety is BEYOND. All these young ppl lost in the space of days, it's stomping my heart. In times like these, dark dark days, how the hell do we have Faith in this sometimes ugly, evil world again?!\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc94"

        "text":"Iv had ptsd for 10 Years, I was never told what to expect or what a flash back is. A little insight in to my more manic\/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days\/week in the hospital she couldn\u2019t stand with out pain.\nFor the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I\u2019d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn\u2019t go in I\u2019d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn\u2019t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.\nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a\/b cup back up to a d\/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time\n\nIv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can\u2019t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don\u2019t really talk in therapy session and the reply\u2019s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school\n\nThere\u2019s an emotion I feel when I\u2019m in a state sometimes, it\u2019s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it\u2019s like there\u2019s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there\u2019s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I\u2019m experiencing and I\u2019m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can\u2019t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.\n  |\n^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^\n\nNo one ever told me what ptsd really entails, if you cold give me a little insight, it would be appreciated.  x\n"

I want to heal and become a whole human being. I want to work through my traumas, remember it, reconcile it, and move on. I want to be able to trust people who deserve it, and walk away from people who deserve that without feeling guilty. I want to be the best version of my self so I can raise my son's to be healthy human beings. \n\nI want to be able to like myself. I want to feel like I deserve things. \n\nMy problems, and their dads, have affected them and I want to help them heal to.

I've tried it before but it's been nothing profound and I have a hard time taking these people's time as if my experiences are as horrific as others who need help more. I tell whiney, complainey, undeserving of telling my story and it holds me back. \n\nI need to be able to unpack my trauma. I need to.  Then I need to work through the emotions. The abandonment, fear, shame, unworthiness. Then I need to put it to bed healthily. Then I need to work with someone to difficult or how I feel about my abusers and what I should do next. \n\nHow do I find someone like this, who can handle the fact that I am so emotionally fragile I may as well be porcelain?

        "text":"Everything but PTSD Up until my diagnosis this year, I had no idea why I was the way I was. There exists only four years of my 30 year life not touched by trauma. \n\nA list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.\n\nExtreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.\n\n\nFainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I\u2019m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children\u2019s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)\n\n\nInsomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn\u2019t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. \n\n\nVivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it\u2019s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies\/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. \n\n\nSocial Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social\/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn\u2019t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)\n\n\nDepression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I\u2019m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn\u2019t make me sad or upset, it\u2019s not like I wanted those things because I don\u2019t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn\u2019t close to my dad but wasn\u2019t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn\u2019t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn\u2019t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)\n\n\nIrregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I\u2019m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight\/flight\/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)\n\n\nConcentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) \n\n\nA few other things I experienced but I don\u2019t feel like going into:\nEating disorders\nAlcohol and drug abuse \nPromiscuity \n\n\nAll of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I\u2019m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. \n\n\nJust now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years. I cannot wait to one day repay them and take over the reigns."

First things first, I in no way intend to be disrespectful, or undermine the experiences of anyone with this post. I am really scared to post this because I\u2019m preempting negative or hostile responses regardless of how supportive and nice this community seems, so please be considerate if you intend to comment. Also, I probably won\u2019t look at the comments for a long time as a way to reduce the fear I\u2019ll feel when reading them. So keep that in mind if you\u2019re expecting a reply from me. \n\nI experience social anxiety a lot. And quite severely too. Even with medication and regular therapy it still affects my daily life to a great extent. \n\nFor those of you not familiar, social anxiety disorder could be summarised as an intense, usually irrational fear of being judged by others. Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it. Basically, it\u2019s a very irrational fear that I\u2019m very aware of. Regardless, I have little control over it as it is essentially instinctual, as y\u2019all probably understand. \n\nEvery now and then something will happen in my life that causes me great stress. A mundane event that becomes worse when combined with my SAD. Usually this is some form of criticism. The symptoms I\u2019ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety\/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I\u2019ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I\u2019m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. \n\nFor example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can\u2019t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn\u2019t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember. For weeks after, the topic of volleyball caused great stress to me. \n\nThe thought of practicing or going to games caused panic attacks. When I thought of the event my core would seize up, heart rate would increase, limbs would start trembling, and sometimes my breathing would speed up or become sporadic. A bit like a mini panic attack, without all the symptoms or duration (these episodes lasted a few seconds, 10 at the most).  \n\nI would avoid the topic of volleyball for weeks after, even stopping reading a book series that mentioned volleyball because it reminded me too much of the event. I would lose interest in volleyball, despite me actually really enjoying it. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years, but thinking of this instance still causes some of these symptoms, to a lesser degree. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had nightmares about this specific situation, but similar events have had negative influences on my dreams in the past. \n\nI\u2019ve provided examples of these symptoms in relation to \/just one\/ event, but keep in mind this still occurs for all of my most stressful experiences which are numerous. \n\nIdk. I just feel kinda bad posting this here, because there are people with legitimately debilitating symptoms from horrible experiences and I\u2019m curious about my problems, which are comparably laughable. And I\u2019m worried I\u2019m doing this \u2018for attention\u2019 or to be \u2018special\u2019, which I\u2019m not. I just can\u2019t help worrying about how others will see this post, and whether I can even trust my own motives. Anyway, thanks for your time. I don\u2019t have anyone else I can talk to, so this is helpful."

It starts with the same nightmare; its me telling someone about what happened. I get questioned to the point where I am not sure about what happened. I start doubting whether or not I was actually abused until I spiral to the point of convincing myself I wasn\u2019t raped, that I must have fabricated everything or misunderstood everything. This stresses me to the point of waking up with a panic attack, convinced for a few minutes that I am some monster who lied about being raped. \n\nEven though this is only a few minutes a few days a week, it is utter psychological torture to have to re-validate that I was abused. I do not understand why it manifested this way in my dreams, I\u2019d almost rather have flashes of the rape and be positive as to who the real monsters are.\n\nI have a laundry list of symptoms from ptsd but I hate this one the most.

I was speaking on his behalf because he didn't want to talk to anyone and ended up being his \"voice\". I hated it. It made me feel guilty and as if I was the problem but I pushed forward and tried supporting him none the less. He runs video game tournaments and the other day he told me he would be there. He told me he was there and starting everything and everything seemed normal until one of his friends messaged me asking where he was. I questioned him and he told me he was at his friend \"Jay's\" house. I stopped talking to him at that point seeing that I was furious.He knew how much I don't trust this person around him when he's unhappy and I always made it a point to never lie where I was, ever. No matter how angry or sad I was. I told him this and was trying to reationalize why I was still with him basically the entire night.\n\nThe next day he messaged me that he was at a crisis walk in center for feeling suicidal with \"Jay\". Guys, I wanted to be supportive so bad but for 3 years I've been trying to get him to go to a therapist. I felt fucking useless and unappreciated and every un- you could think of. I couldn't help but feel stoic and cold throughout him trying to explain. They eventually told him that he was being trasferred to a Psychiatric hold. Very similar to the type I was. Even if it was a low risk hold I felt it in my gut and terror set in.\n\nBack when I was a teenager, I had a lot of issues stemming from chemical imbalances as well as how I grew up. I had a really bad break one day and ended up downing my exes mom's medication in his room. His mom (god bless her soul) got me to the  hospital she worked at and I was transferred to a rehabilitation center that dealt with severe trauma. I was initially on a 72 day hold converted 14 day hold due to my silence and uncooperation throughout the entire process. Honestly, they were some of the worst days of my life and it completely ruined hospitals for me. I don't only panic now a days. If I'm in a hospital, I get nauseous and throw up due to everything that happened while I was being held. It just brings back terrible memories and terrible people I met while there. \n\n\n\nI knew I had to go and see him at the hospital to make sure he was okay. I knew I had to support his first steps towards mental health and support his parents but holy shit. I broke. The fuck. Down. I cried with him because I love him of course. It hurt to see him so scared. I cried even harder in the car going home. I pulled over to a median on the freeway and just cried and screamed for what seemed to be forever because I felt so god damn terrible about having to still deal with things like this. I feel so guilty about not being 110% supportive of whats going on but I feel so fucking useless. No matter how much people say I'm helping, I feel so fucking selfish for wanting all of this shit to stop. \n\n\nEarlier in the day before all this, I felt like I was breaking down because I felt so lonely it physically hurt. It felt so intense and vivid and painful and I felt so hopeless. I've made so much effort trying to counteract my symptoms by trying to put myself out there and it didn't seem to work.. It made everything taste terrible.  I snapped and had to ask a friend if they felt any kind of loneliness that intense just so I could gauge what was normal and he tried but it felt like it wasn't remotely close. My day was already off at me wanting to accept a \"shooting in the woods\" invitation from some acquaintances so I could wander off with a gun and shoot myself where no one would find me. \n\nAnd then this happened.\n\nI'm driving over for visiting hours now after trying to call his payphone 18 times today to no avail. I bought him a card and a stuffed animal considering thats what I got when I was in care. I don't know. I'm not ready for this. I feel so selfish I'm not fucking ready for this shit for the rest of my life.\n\nI don't expect any advice really. I just needed to vent, but if anyone for some god forsaken reason has felt like this too, it would just be nice to know."

Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. \n\n*My dad did drugs\n*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once\n*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once\n*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)\n*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.\n*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)\n*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we \"misbehaved\" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit\/ locked in closets\/ stepped on.\n*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. \n*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep\/ high\/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. \n*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. \n*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.\n*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.\n*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. \n*I was in a \"relationship\" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power...

I need some advice about something I exeprienced in which I cant really find anything similar to my personal account of seeing someone overdose elswhere online to try and get some answers, other perspectives...\nalthough im still on the younger side, i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse just everything in which i am grateful for because it has made me very tough and able to relate with others.. i was dead sure i could handle anything but this . this has turned my world upside downn. it happened last july and i am much better mentally now but i still struggle with ptsd and triggers... i met this kid wonderful heart but misguided (not an addict)  and still has that feeling of invincibility..anyways we were in my room and the first incident we were on my bed and he was holding himself up on top of me kissing me and then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless . ill admit my first reaction was wrong, i was scared, and didnt realize his breathing and heart were stopping i was just shaking him yelling his name.. luckily he popped up and was like what happened wherr am i.. but quickly fell back into his high .. i knew from there something wasnt right so i was on high alert  (he had apparently taken stuff before he got to my house that i was guessing but wasnt sure).. after that he  snorted one in front of me i begged him to stop but he wouldnt and i couldnt force him to stop in that mindset he had . he then went in to use my bathroom (separate toilet room from shower area) and i was like okay ill just keep calling his name to make sure hes okay.. ( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right\u00bf but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone \"stops breathing\" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn .."

I'd fought them for years, and hadn't had them nearly as often lately -- or when I did, I  wasn't remembering them anymore, thank goodness. I recently got a secondary PTSD diagnosis related to medical surgeries\/bone setting, and it has really kicked up my PTSD symptoms. Flinching from loud noises, contact, nightmares, anxiety, constant fear. \n\nWith the new secondary  medical PTSD diagnosis -- the nightmares have come back, are violent, and are atrocious. Was up and down all night, and finally slept around 6AM.  And then I finally slept, and WOW. The nightmares. \n\nWas with a group of really shady people, and we were on some kind of late night mission. It all felt natural though, because I used to socialize with  some pretty shady people... -sighs- Don't ask. Just trying to get this out of my head so that I can shake reliving them in my head. Basically trekked with them to this unknown house, late at night, and everything went super south, super fast. \n\nThe people I was with -- they murdered a woman that used to be my friend. I mean, I got held back, tied up, and told I needed to watch this. It was like being apart of the Manson\/Tate murders, without being included. And I like... watched her, her husband, and her three children, get murdered by these shady people. I didn't... *do* anything. I *couldn't*... do anything. I felt the helplessness. The inability to do anything. I hate my brain. \n\nI think it was guilt. We had a  falling out a few years back over drug use. She got sick, and needed a heart transplant, and died less than a year after the transplant. She passed away a couple years ago, after a heart transplant failed to take.  She only had two kids. It felt so real. Like I hadn't seen her in so long, and in that time, she'd had another kid...\n\nThree kids. Her  and her husband. Still hearing the damned screams. I don't remember it all -- but I definitely remember the screams. The blood. Stabbing. I started to realize it was a dream, and I was screaming. \"WAKE UP! WAKE  UP, IT'S NOT REAL. SHE DIED. I KNOW SHE DIED, WAKE UP.\" I swore I was screaming in my sleep like I used to. I woke up abruptly, rolled out of bed, and just stared at the wall, breathing hard. It was bad. I forgot all about just how bad the night terrors are. They've been bad the past few weeks -- but this one... just... I can't shake it, and I'm still tearing up. Brutal."

The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury.

Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out \"fuck yes\" after I heard on the radio \"we've made contact!\". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. \n\nI'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help.

It was written by a psychologist who attempted to treat PTSD in Vietnam Veterans in the early 1970s and has been trying to understand trauma of all forms for his entire career. It is written partly as a description of his career and the technological developments that helped doctors understand trauma, but it also goes into great detail describing the physical mechanisms of trauma and how to overcome them. And yes, you can overcome them.\n\nI have PTSD from a near death experience that landed me in a 9 day medically induced coma. In trying to recover, I kept meeting people talking about 'energy' or memories living in our muscles and it just always felt confusing or vague and even more disempowering.

Not as difficult as some but just a lot of bad unfair things happening to me and me not deserving any of it.\n\nI've been burned (when I was 3), emotionally abused by my mom, hit by three cars (all from distracted drivers...i was actually stopped in the 2 recent ones and people just hit me...causing concussions and disc bulge and severe whiplash), abused in a toxic relationship, dealt with depression, self harm, anxiety, and had a pulmonary embolism because of birth control. I'm 34. What else is life going to throw at me??\n\nI mean wtf?? I'm so tired of getting knocked back. I've had psychological issues and possible PTSD from the trauma of getting burned as a kid...and my mom never addressed it. She kept saying that something was wrong with me and I needed to get fixed (that I was broken). Well...duh! I suffered trauma at a young age. Then because of her emotional neglect and abuse I've spent the majority of my adult life working on my self worth and going through therapy.\n\nWhen I think life is good...I get hit by a car head on in 2016. I now have chronic pain. It was so hard dealing with all that pain and the hopelessness and depression and PTSD. But I got through it. I started to heal. Then I got a pulmonary embolism in 2017. If the outside world wasn't safe...surely my own body is safe? Wrong.\n\nNow I had PTSD related to body sensations. Being on blood thinners for 8 months was horrible. I felt sick and weak and scared all the time. But I got through it. I went to therapy. I processed. Then again life was seeming okay. I was healing and getting more safe.\n\nThen I get hit by another car. Rear ended while stopped behind a bus and pushed into a pole on the side walk. This was June 2019. I've had vertigo and neck pain. My poor brain and body can't take any more of this trauma. My emotions can't. It's hard to drive. I get scared at any fast car around me thinking how easy it is for one of them to not pay attention and then kill me. Maybe the next one will kill me because life seems to want to do that.\n\nI'm just really tired. What'll I do? Just keep existing until something else traumatic comes along.\n\nMy relationship with my bf may also be ending. Not in anger or drama...in sadness that sometimes it just doesn't work out. That love isn't enough when two people have opposing needs or values. We love each other but that doesn't mean it'll work.\n\nI wish I just had an okay life. That I grew up in a supportive household and that I don't know what it's like for an 800 pound object to be speeding towards me, completely helpless in every way. \n\nThere's no control in life.

I remember staying up all night, and I was convinced that I was gonna die. The whole night I was thinking of ways I was gonna die and was was gonna happen when I was dead. I\u2019m making this post after the day a follow up earthquake was likely to happen but didn\u2019t. But yesterday I was just so scared thinking about the earthquake that happened a day ago that when I wanted to do something, I was thinking in my head what\u2019s the point?, I\u2019m gonna die today anyways. I can\u2019t relax in my bed anymore, if I don\u2019t move for more than a few seconds I start to get paranoid and think that the bed is shaking from an earthquake, and I also think back to the day I thought I was gonna die. Honestly I don\u2019t know what to do or if this is considered ptsd at all."

In one sentence, I would say the following:Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires \u2013 if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less) and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say \"okay, I'm feeling really stressed about this right now. Let's discuss it in an hour.\" And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing. Some anxiety around change is typical. Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive, name calling, finger-pointing, or asking each other to change is a true gift.You may enjoy this quote:\u00a0\"Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment.\" ~Brene Brown"

We live in a world where we are constantly exposed and connected to people who intrigue us and to whom we might feel a connection. I believe that our ability to protect our relationships from the risks involved here has not developed fast enough.\u00a0Your friend came face to face with what leaving the marriage meant...huge changes and many intense emotions. He is wise to consider his choices carefully; especially if you have children, there is good reason to work at a relationship that is less than fulfilling. Therapy can help.So you fell in love with a man who was in an unstable place. He's taking the steps to create some stability for himself and that leaves you \"on hold\", not knowing what his decision will be. I love that you seem willing to give him the space he needs to figure it all out. This decision is his.\u00a0For yourself, you can accept that being \"best friends\" with a man might not be a wise thing. Many marriages don't fair well when friendships like that exist. You flirted with danger; both of you. You fell in love but he wasn't free, really. I'm sure his love for you is real and powerful, but it's not a competition. It's one man choosing his life path. You can focus on thoughts like this:He has the right to choose his life.We flirted with danger by being best friends.I know he does love me; this is not a reflection on my worth.I can feel really good about giving him patience and the space he needs.I feel proud of his honesty.I feel proud if he's willing to fight for his marriage; lucky her...lucky kids.Acknowledge and allow yourself to feel that sadness, that grief. It's real.If you have told anyone about the affair, seek the support of that trusted person and know you have to grieve this in silence because it was born in silence. I wish you well, and for the record, I'm proud of the maturity you show in this situation. :)"

Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. \n\nHey Everyone,   \nFirst time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   \n\n\n1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. \n2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. \n3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him \"If you're gonna hit me, do it!\" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said \"Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her\". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me \"oh I fight with my brothers too!\" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. \n4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. \n5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that \"if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault\".   \n\n\nIn my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole \"PTSD\" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   \nIdk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this. Any comments appreciated."

So Jamie and I had a lot in common, and immediately became friends. I was new in town and she was my first friend.\n\nThe trouble started a year later, (I was 12 at this point, yup I know I'm young) when she started making some horrible comments. For example I told her I was bullied at my last school and she smirked and said \"Oh, so you're an easy target\" It felt weird, I wasn't sure how to react.\n\nLater, when school started again, she kept making comments like those or about my body. I definitely was an early bloomer and she was as well, but she really bugged me about some things about myself.\n\nThen, she molested me. Several times.\n\nAt first it was subtle touches, and she told me she was just physical with friends. I thought it was weird because she wasn't that way with other people.\n\nThen it got worse, like a lot worse. Not rape, but intense making out etc.\n\nSo that happened at the end of the school year and I didn't see her over the summer.\n\nIt was the worse summer of my life, and when school started I was extremely suicidal. At this point, I told a close friend. They helped me a lot.\n\nJamie took it way too far a few days ago. I'm shaken over it. I just want to get her out of my life.\n\nJamie is still abusing me.\n\nBut here's my problem. I want to report Jamie, I really do. But I feel like I can't for two main reasons\n\n1. She's popular at my small school, everyone knows her. It's a private school, so everyone knows each other anyways but she seems like such a nice person on the outside.\n2. I don't want to go to a hospital\/inpaitient. I'm terrified of that.\n\nPlease, if someone knows what I can do say something. I'm sick of feeling alone."

        "text":"Was in a traumatic car accident last week I don't know what I'm trying to gain from posting this, I think I just need to talk about it. Maybe hear similar stories. I've been trying to not talk about it too much to my friends and family because it was traumatic for them, too, and I'm sure they're sick of hearing about it. I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I know it's gonna be long. I apologize in advance. \nI was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically. \nMy mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us. He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake. I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react. \nHis mini van hits us right on my door. I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state. \nIt happened exactly like it does in the movies. In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself. I expected the car to just stop. I keep replaying that moment in my head. Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window. The window shatters on me, the airbag goes off, my door caves in on me. Everything goes red then a pale orange. \nOur car spins what feels like a million times and when we stop everything smells like smoke. I hear screaming and it takes me a while to realize it's me screaming. My mom gets out before I even realize we've stopped moving. I can't get out, my door is caved in. I feel like the car is going to explode and I can't do anything. I'm sure that I'm going to be set on fire. My whole face feels wet and I notice blood dripping onto my jacket. I can't open my right eye. Maybe I was just too scared. I don't know. My mom pulls me out of the car from the drivers side. \nFrom the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming. One woman, who I later learned had medical training of some sort, got a clean towel from her house and put it over my eye. Her daughter was on the phone with 911. She was trying to help me breathe but I was hysterical. I ask if everyone in the other car is okay. She says they're all okay, I'm the only one bleeding. \nAt the hospital, they take two pieces of glass out of my eye, right below my eyebrow. By some miracle, all I have is a concussion, the stitches from the glass above my eye, lots of bruising and some cuts from the glass. I'm gonna be out of work for 1-2 weeks. The general consensus is that I'm very lucky I didn't die. I have lost about 6 of my old classmates to car accidents alone this year. \nOn one hand, I do feel lucky. I should've been in worse shape. On the other hand, to be honest, most days I wake up, I wished it killed me. I feel like I'm trapped in my own life now. Being in cars now is suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box underwater. Loud noises, the smell of smoke, seeing headlights, walking too close to the road, the sound of car horns. Fireworks. Doors closing too hard. Everything scares me. The drives to my doctors appointments are excruciating. I think about what it might've been like if I just died. \nI feel completely out of control of everything. I obsess over everything I can't control now. Natural disasters, house fires, accidents of any kind. I don't want anyone to leave my sight because if I can't see them in front of me, then I don't know they're safe. It feels so unfair this guy just got to rip away my peace of mind. I've become so preoccupied with control. What I can control, what I can't control, what others around me can control. \nI have PTSD already, from childhood abuse and a sexual assault that happened two years ago. I also have OCD which is probably responsible for my new obsessive thoughts. \nMaybe it's dramatic. My injuries are minor compared to what could've happened. But I feel completely broken. I want to stay positive but I'm really struggling with the idea of this being my reality forever. This has destroyed me in a way I could never describe to someone who hadn't felt it."

        "text":"Hallucinations occurring frequently (NSFW) (Marked NSFW due to potentially triggering content)\n\nJust a little backstory. I've suffered from PTSD since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 20 now) and diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18. For years, I would have nightmares where I would relive the experience, which seems pretty common. When I got to about 14, I would go about 2 or 3 days without sleeping to avoid these nightmares because I didn't know how to cope with them. When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.\n\nThe dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating. Everything was going as planned until about 20 minutes in. At this point, I was hearing a man speaking aggressively in French (much like Jacques Brel, but the voice sounded deeper). I'm not fluent in French, so whatever I was hearing is a mystery. The next day a similar thing happened after a nightmare except this time it sounded like a low-flying airplane was in my head. It was loud enough to scare me out of meditation and make my heart race. \n\nThe nightmares have been less frequent since then. I have, however, been experiencing more straightforward hallucinations. Every few hours or so, I'll see a humanoid figure in the corner of my eye. Like someone is behind me watching me. More recently I've also been seeing shadow-like figures running around right in front of me. The other night I was in my girlfriend's room watching a show with her when I noticed in the other corner of the room a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye. I couldn't focus on it enough to make out any features, but I did my best to make sure I really saw something. When I finally glanced over, it was gone. She knew something was up, as I seemed distracted (or maybe she sensed my terror) and asked me what was wrong. I just said I thought I saw something. \n\nI'm afraid to come forward about all of this to anyone in my everyday life. I'm afraid people may think there's something wrong with me. I just need someone to verify that this is normal with PTSD and not another mental illness. I'd also appreciate any anecdotes or advice. Thank you in advance. This has just been scary. I felt like I was doing well for so long. "

        "text":"Intense (triggered) fear of drugs I have no idea where to post this, and I\u2019m even sure I have ptsd I just don\u2019t know how to deal with this. When I was in middle school my older brother got into drugs and became a heroin addict shortly after. My mother would cry everyday and act coldly toward me and my little brother. She would go on fits of panic hyperventilating and pacing through our whole house and saying stuff like \u201cplease god just take my life instead of his\u201d. My dad would scream at my older brother horrible things and I don\u2019t blame him because my brother was horrible. He would steal things like my favorite video games and pawn them for drug money and I was too scared of upsetting my parents so I wouldn\u2019t tell them. I loved my brother so much I wanted to protect him even though he was ruining my life. I would find his burnt spoons and pills and just sob all night. I watched him but drugs from weird cars in front of our house when I\u2019d get home from school. Sometimes the drug cars would sit outside my house when I was home alone and I was so scared and confused. I would walk past his room and he would be sitting still with a blank expression staring at one corner of his room like a zombie. He actually overdosed and was dead until he was resuscitated in the ER. My parents would pay for different rehabs and they never worked. My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house. I felt so alone I would cut myself and make myself throw up or I would hysterically cry randomly at school or with friends. I wanted to just get in a car accident or find the courage to kill myself. I couldn\u2019t ever get help or tell my family because it would make the situation worse. All I wanted was for my mom to hug me and say everything was going to be okay. \n\nNow I\u2019m 19 and he\u2019s doing much better. He seems to be clean but you can never really be sure, but he seems much happier. But I am left with this scar that I don\u2019t think will ever go away. I fear drugs of any kind, I fear alcohol, I fear it all. Being around people doing those things make me panic on the inside. I do a good job usually of hiding it, but then I go home and cry. It\u2019s hard when everyone I know my age does all sorts of drugs and drinks. I\u2019ve lost friends, It\u2019s caused a breakup. I avoid movie scenes with drug use because it makes me that sick to my stomach and memes or people talking about drugs absolutely ruin my day. The thought of my boyfriend smoking or drinking still disturbs me greatly and makes me cry, but I don\u2019t want to control him. I know people use these things to find peace but I don\u2019t know why and it makes me so intensely upset. I wish I could protect everyone from these things but I can\u2019t. I know i sound crazy. I don\u2019t cry as much anymore. Sometimes the urge to hurt myself returns but I do well at suppressing that. I don\u2019t know if this is ptsd or if this was considered trauma I don\u2019t know anything I just know I feel hopeless."

Very good! I commend your strength. Your feelings are not uncommon and the feelings of abandonment, or second guessing or loss of happiness are also not uncommon. \u00a0It's also not uncommon for these issues to arise and trickle into our adult life and relationships.\u00a0Again, with little information about your situation, it is hard to give an exact answer. However, those who have experienced a dysfunctional childhood or trauma, often present with the issues and feelings you've described. The great news, is that with good therapy, you can regain your happiness, self worth and begin to feel \u00a0empowered, you deserve to be happy. Be patient, gentle and kind \u00a0to yourself. I would encourage you to begin with searching for a licensed therapist in your area, maybe go for a consultation session \u00a0and simply see how your feel about it.

I need some advice about something I exeprienced in which I cant really find anything similar to my personal account of seeing someone overdose elswhere online to try and get some answers, other perspectives...\nalthough im still on the younger side, i have been through rape, death, addictions, abuse just everything in which i am grateful for because it has made me very tough and able to relate with others.. i was dead sure i could handle anything but this . this has turned my world upside downn. it happened last july and i am much better mentally now but i still struggle with ptsd and triggers... i met this kid wonderful heart but misguided (not an addict)  and still has that feeling of invincibility..anyways we were in my room and the first incident we were on my bed and he was holding himself up on top of me kissing me and then ramdomly he froze there for like 10 second movement no breath but still holding himself up.. he then fell over sideways onto the bed and was lifeless . ill admit my first reaction was wrong, i was scared, and didnt realize his breathing and heart were stopping i was just shaking him yelling his name.. luckily he popped up and was like what happened wherr am i.. but quickly fell back into his high .. i knew from there something wasnt right so i was on high alert  (he had apparently taken stuff before he got to my house that i was guessing but wasnt sure).. after that he  snorted one in front of me i begged him to stop but he wouldnt and i couldnt force him to stop in that mindset he had . he then went in to use my bathroom (separate toilet room from shower area) and i was like okay ill just keep calling his name to make sure hes okay.. ( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right\u00bf but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone \"stops breathing\" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn .."

She would hit me for breathing too loud, monitoring everything I did, she joined my bullies at school, she told me everyday I was shit, pathetic and nothing. She ground me down, and every time I see her, I feel total rage and want to scream. I have only been actively triggered by her a few times, and the rest of the time I just get this blind anger and rage when I see something I know she likes (animated Disney movies, Halloween, certain candy brands, etc).\n\nI got sexually assaulted and would relive it in my dreams. I could never see his face, and I still can\u2019t remember it, but I remember his hands. Regularly relived this for about 3 years after it happened, then it stopped. This wasn\u2019t a rape. It was all hands. I always thought it was mild but the effect it has on me for years after Wasn\u2019t mild. \n\nI came out as trans (unrelated to anything else, but being a closeted trans kid wasn\u2019t fun in itself) and I lost friends. A lot of bad stuff went down, fed into stuff from my sister...I don\u2019t want to go into detail, but the world became terrifying and far more dangerous over night, and I lost so many people I loved and I blamed myself for it. I still relive this stuff today.\n\n I tried to kill myself, mostly due to my life falling apart, anxiety and not being able to deal with whatever this is, whether it is ptsd or something else. I messed it up, thought about what my parents would think, and went for help at my local ER. They took me and locked me on a ward and wouldn\u2019t let me leave. I still can\u2019t go into hospitals and I have attacks whIch feel just like I did when they took me in. I can get set off now by seeing people being imprisoned on tv.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking is, are these things and my responses to them typical of ptsd? I know I should be asking a doctor but honestly, I can\u2019t do it. I would rather die than go back to a hospital. I know that is silly but I just can\u2019t.\n\nI was in therapy for a year after I got out of hospital (thankfully, in an office that looked nothing like a hospital) and they never gave me a diagnosis more than \u201csevere anxiety &amp; depression.\u201d I suspected I had some kind of ptsd but assumed that it would have come up. Also...I\u2019m not a war vet and my symptoms have been fairly mild compared to some of the stories on here. But then...a couple of friends of mine with ptsd told me I should think about it.\n\nBasically, are my experiences typical of ptsd and should I push through and put myself back in the healthcare system to work this out?\n\nThank you for reading.

Tw: childhood sexual abuse &amp; neglect Long story short, the sexual abuse happened around 4-5 years of age and the emotional neglect went on for over a decade after. I have amnesia from the sexual trauma, but am currently dealing with crippling night terrors that are confusing me as to what I thought happened. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re flashbacks, I know they\u2019re dreams, but they\u2019re traumatic in themselves because of the disgusting images I\u2019m left with when I wake up. It\u2019s horrifying and overwhelming. \n\nI recently made huge headway in therapy and have finally learned to stop dissociating\/going numb, something I\u2019ve done for my entire life. Now that I can feel, I\u2019m drowned in emotion, sadness, anger, hurt, but that\u2019s good because I\u2019m finally really feeling everything. It\u2019s the not being able to calm myself down and help myself feel safe again that\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m going to see a psychiatrist to see if I can get meds for the chronic nightmares (it\u2019s been an entire year now), but in the meantime I don\u2019t know how to calm myself when I\u2019m emotionally overwhelmed. No one taught me how to properly soothe myself and all I\u2019ve ever known is resorting to numbness. \n\nSo here\u2019s my question, friends: how do you self soothe when you\u2019re overwhelmed and can\u2019t stop sobbing? How do you take care of yourself and help yourself feel safe? \n\nThank you for reading~"

Because I saw and felt what it does to you, at times of conflict or out of randomness it occurs.  I have learned by myself to learn from it and to adapt to it but to also challenge it, when thoughts or feelings come. It\u2019s okay I always tell myself and it is true I am okay I have no medical illness or diseases. \n \nMy mindset has always helped me and I hope by telling you the reddit community. I hope some well agree disagree and some will give me more advice then what I have. One thing I learned from my mindset is to stop or to never engage in the victim mindset. Meaning what is done is done, dwell on it for a few I agree your a human being.  but to fond and to idolize what was done or what happened has been always a no no.  I learned that I couldn\u2019t control people or their actions I was a kid but I couldn\u2019t control people. It\u2019s not your fault don\u2019t blame yourself.( I can sit here and say what happened but I\u2019m not.) because one it\u2019s done with nothing can honestly change it, and 2 the goal with this is to idolize yourself and to help you get on the Road of recovery.\nVices, Pride and Ego\n All these things cooked me. It\u2019s not a weak thing or weak to ask for help  it\u2019s actually a great thing. I got my head out of my ass because of this I met a person and I started to get out of my comfort zone and started to challenge myself. The world is big it\u2019s not small it feel small when you trap yourself in a cycle of negative thoughts. It was uncomfortable I agree at first and I failed at times but i got the second time coming.  \nFailures:\nAt times you will fail like every human being does but when you have ptsd it feels like the end of the world like relax man it\u2019s not. I learned that too.\nForgiveness \nBiggest one and it takes a while this one is the hardest for us. Forgive but forgive for yourself, forgive yourself what happened the person and whatever occurred. \nDon\u2019t fall into a victim mindset it\u2019s okay we all go through troubles in life some worse then others and some not as much. We all take things differently but never idolize the trauma, idolize yourself  because when you idolize the trauma the negative cycle of thoughts begins. \n\nPs- I hope I didn\u2019t offend anyone or hurt anyone, i just wanted to tell my mindset and how I felt with ptsd and how I still live with it."

Any comment from you guys will be very appreciated! \n\nSo I recently broke up with my girlfriend over a big fight. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had a fight like this and every-time we get into an argument she tends to get very defensive and start attacking me. She gets into this rage of cursing me out loud regardless of where we are or who we are with and goes on for 30 minutes. In the beginning of the relationship, I thought this to be more nothing more than anger management and her personality. She tends to be very aggressive with her words and starts attacking the other person when she feels like she gets taken advantage of. There are a few restaurants that Im still ashamed to go because my ex and I caused a very unpleasant scene. I mean everyone gets like that when they get mad but it was way too extreme. She had so much hatred and negativity against certain type of people and would even mention of hurting the others at extreme.\n\nAfter the breakup, I had some time to catch up with a friend. We were just having a couple of drinks just chatting and the word \u201cPTSD\u201d was brought up. And this word instantly hit me so hard... I mean folks I never experienced it and never thought I would meet anyone who had it. But deep inside me I knew my ex was going through PTSD. \n\nOne of the symptoms she had was nightmare. She never shared her nightmare with me except for once and I never insisted on her telling me since it always put her in a bad mood. But that time she told me, it\u2019s someone trying to attack her and she cant seem to do anything about it..... The other physical symptoms she had (at least thats what I think) were her migraines. She was very sensitive to noises. She would scream in th middle of the night and scared the shit out of me. She also would jerk her leg at night saying it hurts and would not be able to go to sleep. She told me she has a bad memory. All of this indicate that she has PTSD but I was oblivious to the symptoms.  Now that I have learned this, I only have regrets of not being more understanding and guiding her in th right direction. Although I have to admit that I was very exhausted from this relationship I cant deny the fact that I still love her and care for her.    Im willing to put myself in her shoes even if that means I take away just a little of the pain she goes through.\n\nFolks, I would love to hear some of you guys go through. Obviously talking about symptoms is not pleasant but if anyone is willing to share what they have to go through it will be much appreciated.\n\nThanks"

He has always been supportive. \nHowever, about a week ago, I was at his house, and my mind was absolutely locked onto thoughts involving a recent trauma, I was raped in the spring, and he knew this. I was pacing and out of focus and trying to work through it, and I told him that's what was on my mind.\n\nHe continually asked if I was okay, but would interrupt me if I spoke with asking, that was the first sign he really wasn't paying attention (I didn't want extra attention but in case something happened he would at least know which trauma it related to). He then proposed to help me, I said I didn't think there was anything he could do at this moment, and he replied with \"We could have sex, that takes your mind off things!\" \n\nI was shocked, but also so deep in my mind I didn't react right away. He assumed I did not hear him, so he suggested it again, and I told him now isn't the time. He then started playfully grabbing me and saying he was going to make me feel good, asking for sex, and I was IMMEDIATELY covered in this layer of disgust and discomfort, I felt like gagging. I quickly pulled away and yelled NO, and he then made a 'pouty' face and then turned away from me. \n\nI was shaking for about five minutes, unable to move, and felt so dirty and ashamed. \nI got up to leave (I was going to leave around this time anyway), and was very quiet when leaving. He gave me a hug, and squeezed me super tight, which made me yell STOP, and rush out the door. \n\nI have barely spoken to him, and I did get the courage to tell him (through text unfortunately) exactly what happened. He apologized profusely, admitted he should have paid more attention, etc.\n\nBut now my issue is, I feel gross even if he messages me. I haven't been able to respond to him. He keeps telling me about his days and then ending with \"oh sorry, I always make it about me,\" and I know him well enough to know he is not intending that statement in a passive aggressive manner, that's just his way of saying he feels he made another mistake through a text.\n\nI feel so guilty because every strong feeling I had for him immediately vanished, I don't want to hurt him, and (selfishly) I don't want to be so alone again. But now he reminds me of the assault in the spring, I dont know how to move forward or mend this situation. \n\nSorry for the long post, it's my first one and I felt context was necessary, any advice would be helpful.

Im not sure on whether this is the right place to post this, but i want to go on a rant, apologies for those of you who sort by new.\n\nI don\u2019t feel safe at all now; i\u2019m terrified to leave my own house. I live in a safe city in england, and a safe\/rich neighbourhood on top of that, but i go to a reallyyyy far away school in a really dodgy area. I\u2019m really fucking sick of what goes on. \nThe area is a predominantly asian\/black area, and i\u2019m white. This place is known for all the druggies, stabbings, dodgy people in general, and how it\u2019s quite a poor place. I get catcalled here alllll the time and i\u2019m sick of it. \n\nThe other day, i was walking around the corner to school, and this homeless man comes up to me, saying \u2018hey beautiful\u2019. I ignored him, and he got mad at me saying, \u2018all these privileged white people thinking they can be disrespectful\u2019. I looked back and gave him a death stare. He then tried to make a grab for my coat but i ran off. \n\nI was on a crowded train, and a guy slipped his hand under my shirt. I swatted his hand away, and left the train, giving him a dirty look, and he had the audacity to came off with me. I managed to escape by running off into the ladies\u2019 bathroom, saw a sweet looking mom, and asked her to walk out with me, pretending that she was my mom. The guy backed off. \n\nIve even had a knife held to my throat before, which i don\u2019t like talking about, and another NDE that i also don\u2019t like talking about. I\u2019ve witnessed stabbings here myself and it\u2019s left me scarred. \n\nAnother time, i was getting some food and there were some guys lingering in an alleyway. It was like 7:30pm, and it was pitch black because it was winter. I got out of school late because we had an open evening after school. This one is a bit more intense. As i said, there were guys lingering in an alleyway, and they had the smell of alcohol on them. I hadn\u2019t even realised they were there, but they grabbed me by the hair off the high street, pulled me into the alleyway and made me suck their dicks, forcing my head onto them and choking me until i threw up and almost fainted. \n\nA couple weeks ago, after christmas, i was in london and was gangraped in a freezing park and impregnated. I had it aborted like a week ago but that still sucks. And that wasn\u2019t the first abortion that i had to have. When i was 9, i was abducted and impregnated. That kid was also aborted. Literally two nights ago, we were at my mom\u2019s friend\u2019s dinner party and stayed the night. One of the guests crept into my room and raped me all night and i pretended to be asleep. And i think i might be pregnant because i just got off my period and am ovulating. I hope not; you can only check after like 5\/6 days, so this\u2019ll be a long 5 days. \n\nMy dad molested\/raped me with his friends up until i was 8, and my uncle molested\/raped me between the ages 4 and 6. My friend\u2019s dad molested me between 9 and 12. I also have all these other incidents where family friends have done shit. \n\ni\u2019ve had way more stories but this is already hella fucking long and nobody here will probably read to the end. But i just wanna talk about how much this has messed with my head. I get sleep paralysis multiple times a week, self harm at least twice a day, get fever dreams, constant flashbacks etc. I have body dysmorphia, and am insecure as fuck. I\u2019m still a minor; in my mid-teens. I\u2019ve attempted suicide twice in the past 3 days and my family have only just caught up on the fact that i\u2019ve got mental health issues because i have a thing of not telling anybody about my problems because my trust issues are really bad. \n\nIm so sorry for anybody who\u2019s even read this far, once again, useless rant that i\u2019ll probably delete in a few hours."

A few days ago, person A, not even an hour after I disclosed it (I was taking my meds, so curious A asked about them), intentionally scared me. Just a yell very close to my face when I turned around, and I flat out smacked him.\n\nWe got into some heated banter and I took more meds (accidentally 1 over the daily max..I'm okay I think?)

At least that\u2019s how it felt to me. My parents had me when they were very young. My dad was a drug dealer and my mom was fifteen. I was a premature baby and since my parents were kids, my grandmother (my moms mother) was practically raising me a lot of the time. But my parents resented me for something they allowed to happen. They tried to make it so I couldn\u2019t see her but when they wanted to go out well they would stop saying that. I would always get caught in the middle of their fights, glasses getting thrown, some even hit me, getting knocked over, getting screamed at for being in the room when they were fighting. And then it got worse. Whenever I tried to Hug my parents they\u2019d either tell me to go away or they\u2019d ask me what I wanted and push me out of the way. They\u2019d tell me they never wanted me. They got older and when I was seven had another kid. And overtime three more. My parents stopped with the non legal stuff but they still constantly had their issues with each other, and whenever they didn\u2019t get along they would take it out on me. I was grounded for months at a time for no reason, everything taken out of my room. Sometimes even locked in. And I was a pretty good child. I was just really sad. Just wanted a family. In middle school I tried really hard to get away. I went to the police and showed them the bruises told them of the horror I was living, but since I was in an upper class family they said I had it good and I should be grateful. I\u2019m transgender which is another reason they just really didn\u2019t like me. One time when I went to the police my mom threw herself into a cabinet and said I threw her, and I ended up having to go through the legal system as a very naive autistic innocent kid who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. I was constantly just told I wasn\u2019t wanted, pushed, hit, and when I ran away on my 18th birthday they made me feel like a monster for leaving. And the rest of my family says that it wasn\u2019t abuse. That I had a good childhood. But I remember laying in my bed begging to either die or get another family. I don\u2019t know"

        "text":"What if my hurt and issues (disorganised attachment) stem from an innaccurate perception of my memories about my parents? so uuuuuuuh yeah this post carries a content warning for parental abuse, chiefly physical, I think?\n\nI'm 27, a trans woman, pre-anything, and I'm in therapy. I initially started going because I felt like I generally needed support with being almost entirely closeted outside of the net and needing help with getting the support of my parents. The more I stayed on the more the subject became 'me' overall, and over the year or so I've been in therapy now it's the most productive it's been, rather than just doing tunnel vision on a specific problem. She's on leave right now.\n\nI ended up describing some difficulties I was having with relationships and even just general socialising and it lead to us doing the adult attachment interview. In the course of that, I was describing stuff with my parents. I described some particular incidents where I remembered being pushed against a hard plastic prop in a theme park when I was a kid, another when my mother screamed at me and threw my own shoes at me, and another where I remembered her grabbing me, spinning me around and shoving me onto a curb before storming away. In each of these instances, I had been annoying them prior in some fashion, or misbehaving. There's probably a few others, but those stood out.\n\nI told my therapist about how I would remember these events, rather vividly, every few weeks or so and that the more I talked about my parents over the sessions - which took some effort, as I would avoid the subject earlier on - the more frequently I thought about them. And apparently that, uh...apparently that's not normal? Prior, I had just assumed it was normal to keep remembering stuff like that. We got to the end of the interview, over the course of 3 sessions because I kept crying during it. High on anxiety, high on avoidance. Congratulations. It's a Fearful-Avoidant.\n\nWe continued talking about these things, still do. It was the first time someone referred to what I went through as incidences of abuse. I would always just say to myself, before this, that I couldn't have been abused because my parents cared about me, or it didn't count as abuse because it was inconsistent, because I was never routinely or ritualistically beaten, or that it didn't count because I deserved it.\n\nA few weeks ago, my mother accused me of disrespecting her after not responding to some asinine suggestion. I ended up being made to sit in front of my parents and made to tell them why I will talk about things to a therapist without telling them. So I was upfront about it - 'you have a history of treating me with anger and violence'.\n\nI was immediately met with incredulity. I was made to outline the events. I named them. One of them - the shoes - she said she didn't remember.  Two others - spinning me around and put to the curb, and being shoved against a prop at Legoland - she says I was misremembering. The former, she just pushed me away because I was being (her words) 'such a horrid thing', the latter, she says I fell and they were helping me up (I have cerebral palsy, balance issues - results in overprotective helicopter parents, to boot). Now, I'm not going to say she was wrong. These were years ago. More than a decade. Nearly two decades in one instance. And every time you remember something, you make an imperfect photocopy of it. My perception, built up over the years as I somehow drifted further and further from my parents, may not be perfect.\n\nShe then went on to ask me if I remembered one time that she definitely did hit me - I said I didn't. She explains an instance where she slapped me, because I was misbehaving, and she was mortified afterwards. 'See, you're remembering it wrong, it's all made up.' I felt like we were approaching something, because at least here she was admitting, of her own accord, to some wrongdoing.\n\nThen, she said 'It was probably even just the shock of it then, I didn't hurt you.' My face fell. She admits to actually hitting me once, then justifies it with simultaneous 'you deserved it' and 'it wasn't even a real hit'.\n\nThat's the thing that kept me grounded. That wasn't okay. It wasn't okay to justify it. It wasn't okay to effectively corner me and make me spill the beans over what's going on in therapy because I'm seen as property. But still, the doubt remains - what if I'm wrong about this stuff that happened to me? What if I'm remembering it a certain, innaccurate way, and it's colouring my perception of everything else?\n\nEven if my memories are wrong, though, the effects are there. I struggle with relationships. In bad days I dread getting up and seeing my parents. I feel anxious at mealtimes when I have to be near them. I am very apprehensive about the notion of going on vacation with them. I had trouble talking about them in therapy and when my therapist suggested a roleplay for tackling a subject, I just locked up and couldn't do it. That shit just doesn't come from nowhere, right? And if you want to look at fearful-avoidance as springing from your primary caregivers simultaneously giving you a lot of love and a lot of pain, well that day, where I'm being held and told that they'll 'support me' as a trans person while justifying and denying shit that my mother did to did to me, all from effectively forcing me to answer questions (understand, 'leave the room' is not something that presents itself as an option in my mental landscape) and prioritise my mother's pain over 'being disrespected' above all else, *that's* a big fucking dose of that.\n\nSorry for the long post. It's just all so fucked."

Any outlandish treatments you\u2019ve heard of or programs you are aware of? \n\nFor example, I\u2019ve heard of psychologists administering mind altering drugs (brought up by my psychiatrist actually - I want to say cocaine?....but I can\u2019t remember. Basically, in a nutshell, the patient takes a medical grade dose of the cocaine(?) and then has a therapy session to change the bad thoughts and feelings associated with your triggers and turn them into good feelings, retraining the brain to feel differently about that traumatic event\/s).  However, in my country (Australia), this treatment is still in the veeeery early stages of recognition. \n\n\n\nAre there programs or treatments (old wives tales even!) that have helped you or someone you know? \n\nI\u2019m trying to brainstorm as many ideas as possible :)\n\n\nAlso, I just want to say - I understand that I am fortunate to have an insurance crowd pay for my treatments. I know not everyone has their medications and treatments paid for by someone else. I am grateful for this silver lining to a shitty rain cloud. I hope I don\u2019t come across as being insensitive to other people\u2019s circumstances. I just want to try everything I can before I am medically discharged - while work are offering to pay, so then I can determine what treatments I do wish to continue financing for myself in the future. \n\nThank you for reading. Sorry if this is all over the place (I took my sleeping medications half an hour ago\ud83d\ude2c) \n\nI appreciate any input.\n\n\u270c\ufe0f"

I feel so physically sick and repulsed by the fact that nearly a year and over 5 court dates later, he's still unwilling to own up to what he's done to me. Just when I thought that I would never have to see him again (I transferred schools) I find out that I have to face him in court. The mere thought of this has lead me to feel like my lungs are collapsing and my entire body feels weak and defeated. Going to trial means re-experiencing my trauma all over again, except with him present to see just how much damage he did to me. I don't want him to see how much he has destroyed me and taken my piece of mind. I don't want him to get the sick satisfaction of seeing me cry but I know that going through a trial will bring me to tears. I fear that seeing him again will retraumatize me in a way and undo the progress that I have made in therapy. Any advice or simply kind words would be appreciated."

        "text":"I've been diagnosed with PTSD but it doesn't feel right (Mention of violence) This is going to be a long post. Sorry!\n\nI've always had anxiety but a little over a year ago I got the courage to solo-travel New Zealand long term. I gained a ton of confidence while doing this, and overcame a lot of my social anxiety. Eventually I got a job in Christchurch, it wasn't all perfect, I had my ups and downs but I was doing pretty well - going for walks frequently, exploring the city, living a 'normal life'.\n\nThen the shooting happened. To be clear, I didn't see\/hear\/experience anything. My life was never in actual danger, I was just living in the city at the time. At first it was disbelief, then fear (not knowing if they caught everyone) then crippling sadness. I had such a strong desire to run away and just go home but I couldn't right away. One of my coworkers was shot and spent months in ICU. I left Christchurch a little over a week after the attack. It felt wrong, but I had been offered a job back home and had already put my notice in at work.  \n\nAt first when I got back home and started my new job I was mostly fine. I was living with my parents until I could get an apartment in the city closer to work. I moved into my apartment in May and started having issues pretty quickly. Waking up multiple times a night, disoriented and sweaty. Random attacks of sadness and excessive anger over small problems. Being afraid of random people on the street. Wanting\/needing to go do something (go to the store for example) and having a mental block. Anxiety over inconsequential things.\n\nI started going to therapy in June and he diagnosed me with PTSD. He gave me an ESA letter to get a dog which has helped immensely. But the therapy wasn't helping, my brain would kind of just shut off and I wouldn't have anything to say and I wouldn't remember anything he would say. It was really just giving me more anxiety so I stopped going.\n\nThe diagnosis just doesn't feel right to me. Maybe because I know I was never in any actual danger. I get intrusive memories of the sadness and aftermath though.  Recently I've been even more hyper-vigilant than usual. I listen to audiobooks at work so my mind doesn't wander but it makes me anxious because I don't always know when someone approaches me, and I jump when they do. I get anxious walking outside when its too quiet, dark, rainy (hood up, peripheral vision blocked) or too crowded, and I cant walk with headphones in. I feel like I am constantly stressed and anxious even though I have no real reason to be. I scratch at arms and hands and have a hard time making myself stop.\n\nI've always had problems with anxiety and mood swings so I'm having a hard time distinguishing from old symptoms and new. Part of myself keeps thinking that this isn't PTSD, this is just my anxiety coming back.\n\nI don't even know what I am looking for from posting this, other than maybe if other people have gone through the same thoughts."

Emotionally and mentally, and has not done anything physically but I think he would be capable of it. \n\nI have a chronic illness and was undiagnosed for a very long time. He thought I was lying. So he wouldn\u2019t let me ice me joint and would tell me I was weak. Eventually I believed him. I still do to an extent. There are numerous other abusive things that would happen. \n\nBut I never considered myself a trauma victim. I already thought \u201ceveryone else has it worse\u201d. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I do have a therapist, but I never told him about any of the stuff with my biodad. I had convinced myself that I was over reacting and everything was fine. \n\nRecently, right before lockdown I met this great guy. I have issues around men (not I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s because my biodad always intimidated me) so I told him that before we started dating. He was really sweet about it. I explained that if he yelled I would completely break down and if we have an argument, it wouldn\u2019t help. Our relationship has progressed and one night I was really having an awful night. \n\nCouldn\u2019t sleep and I had some really bad flashback like nightmares. He called me and we chatted on the phone for a bit. After talking and me apologizing for talking about stuff. I said \u201cI don\u2019t get why it effects me. It\u2019s not like I was abused. I wasn\u2019t traumatized\u201d and he said \u201cI think you were. You\u2019re having a trauma response and you deserve help. You deserve to be able to tell people. He hurt you really badly and you\u2019re allowed to not feel okay\u201d\n\nAnd then it all kinda clicked?

Then, 4 more years passed and my mom finally got full, but he had visitation every other weekend. As you can probably guess, it got worse. I was 16 when he finally tried to kill me by abandoning me up in upstate New York on a mountain with no food or water on a 12 hour hike (normally 12 hours). I got lost and too a long trail around and was out on my own for 36 more hours before I finally made it to the trail head and called the police. It took me so long because I had to free climb, I had to swim, and I had to drink from a river. That resulted in a very nasty virus that emptied my guts. The worst part of it though, was when he came to pick me up. He yelled at me and nearly decked me.

I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;\n\n2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"new version\" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the \"original\" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a \"substitute\" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

She's about 2 years older than me, and we were always very nerdy, we would play as star trek characters or something and run around outside, sometimes we'd play as Mario characters. I was the younger sibling so I'd always get stuck playing the boy bc sis wanted to play as a girl. Eventually the Mario playing turned sexual, but here's the thing, we never actually touched each other, it would always be one of us just sitting on the other and stuff like that. It's very rare for me to remember things that happened to me when I was a child because of how badly I was bullied and beaten in school. (A kid damaged my eye so badly that my vision is damaged for life and I have to wear glasses.) This leads me to believe u have ptsd because I block out like all of school from my memories. Anyway, the events with sis went on until I was probably 12 or 13, her being 14-16. I'm 16 now and I can't imagine thinking its acceptable to play with a kid in that way. To describe it better it basically turned into roleplaying. We would act out sex with the motions and sounds but never actually do more than grind basically. Can someone please help? Should I get therapy? Was it rape? Would this contribute if I did have trauma and now developed ptsd? Thank you for reading."

(possibly triggering for sexual abuse, rape, trauma) Hi everyone,\n\nI'm pretty new to this sub and would like some insight into what others feel when they are experiencing flashbacks.\n\nBACKGROUND INFO (skip if you want)\n\nTo give some background information on my experience, I was sexually abused\/raped(?) by my step dad 4 years ago (and sexually abused by him multiple times over many years before) but I didn't get any medical help for that although I did tell my mum and boyfriend about it after the \"big happening\". I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. \n\n**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. \n\nFor me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. \n\nWhy do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   \n\nTL;DR\n\nmy flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny feedback would be great.

Hi \/r\/PTSD, first time visitor here. \n\nMy GF has recently been given a definitive diagnosis of PTSD after several runarounds with different doctors\/psychiatrists and I'm looking for pointers on how to help alleviate any pressures or triggers for her, and maybe help her symptoms improve, if possible. \n\nShe's been the victim of sexual assaults on two different occasions and her dad was physically abusive when she and her siblings were young(he was FOB at the time and has softened since, not that I'm excusing him - his actions affect her to this day). On top of this there is a history of depression in her family, which she seems to have inherited, so her moods can be very dark even when she's not triggered. It's hard to know what's what she's suffering from.\n\nShe's been trying different anti-depressants since she was 19, when she started having trouble with school. About 2 years ago she admitted to being suicidal after her previous relationship ended(we had met but weren't a couple yet). She was taken in and seen by a panel of psychiatrists\/doctors who asked her loads of questions and then released her, not really doing anything or giving her any info - she says it was a horrible experience. Her family doctor has sent her to a few different specialists since, all who do an interview with her before bouncing her back to family doctor saying they're not qualified. \n\nThe most recent doctor, a CBT specialist, listened to her about how fed up she was with the lack of progress, he looked through her previous files and interviewed some of the professionals she'd previously seen and was able to find that she'd been given a PTSD diagnosis, which is a step in the right direction, but as a CBT specialist he's not qualified for PTSD so he shunted her back to her doctor. So we're back to waiting for her doctor to find someone who's qualified to help her. We've made progress finally but it's been a pain in the arse.\n\nShe's in college for the third time now, after dropping out twice from different courses. For the first time, yesterday and today, she's had trouble leaving the house to go to her new course. Completing school is very important to her but she's so debilitated she can't get out of the bed\/chair to do anything, and I'm in work so I can't give physical comfort\/encouragement. She's just sitting, stuck to the spot by panic\/sadness. When it's happened before I've asked questions about where the sadness\/panic comes from and she says she doesn't know - which makes it hard for me to give her any kind of solace other than that I love her and am there for her. I want to help more but I can't think of anything else that could help and I'm afraid the pattern that's stopped her from sticking out college before will happen again.   \n\nShe's on Wellbutrin for the day and Seroquel for the night. I'm not delighted about the latter because it's so heavy but it does the job so I'm not saying anything...\n\nI support her, I try to be there for her, I try to be emotionally present and not fatigued with the constant roadblocks. I try to vet media for content that could trigger her and I keep an eye on her in social situations in case I see her start to fade\/get triggered.. I'm fine with it even if it's hard sometimes.\n\nIs there anything I'm not doing\/could be doing\/should stop doing? \nThank you."

The staff were abusive and gave me so much medication that on my 8th day of being there i only thought it was my 3rd day due to how out of it i was.\nSo, for the most part i barely remember everything that happened there but sometimes i get random flashbacks to moments I either blocked out or didn't remember due to the medication.\n\nOne I recently remembered happened around my last day there. The only reason I left was due to the fact that i had a melt down during visitations and my family forced me out of the hospital, by now I'm questioning if this was one of the things that caused my tipping point.\n\nI have bad psoriasis, it was especially bad back then. Covered 75-80% of my body, so i constantly had to use medicine. The staff would give me it after taking my pills and I'd go to a private room by myself to apply it.\nWell, near the last day a nurse didn't hand it to me but instead took it, brought me to a different room, took my shirt and pants off without warning, then started applying it to my body. She then went on to go underneath my underwear to apply it onto my backside.\n\nI was too confused and dazed to really do anything or tell her I was uncomfortable because the medication instantly hit me with drowsiness\/fuzziness but i remember feeling humiliated and shocked by it.\n\nShe was a female nurse, kind of sweet but could be very rude at times.

I feel guilty because maybe she was just really use to taking care of little kids and got carried away? Is that behavior normal? No one else in the hospital did that to me from what i remember.

I started going to therapy, I quit drinking and doing drugs, started medication again, things have been getting better slowly. Now the wall is down, memories and emotions started flooding in, flashbacks started again, suicidal ideation started more frequently ( I will never go through with it) and for the life of me I can't seem to understand how bad my situation was growing up, I know it was wrong and not normal but something is blocking me from viewing it rationally. It was just my life, I have no other perspective or anything I can compare it to.  I'm more writing this out to just to get it out so... Here we go\n\nMy first memory of my father was when I was 2 to 4, my mom was leaving for work, he was hungover I'm assuming and I was crying staring out the window because she was leaving me, I didn't stop after she left, I remember my dad had his hand on his face not looking well, barley attempting to calm me down when he grabbed my pj shirt and slapped me across the face, the memory ends there. Typically he would use a belt or a metal shoe horn, he didn't get more physical until I was older but that is maybe my first memory of my childhood that comes to mind. Everything is fuzzy but that one is clear as day. I would run away from him when I would get in trouble and he would chase me around the house snapping his leather belt over and over until he caught me and would then beat me bare ass with it, I can't remember the pain or even being hit with the belt, I just remember the before it happened. I do remember I would become hysterical often but I can't clear up andly specific memories, I just feel the emotion and I know it happened often. \n\nThe next portion of memories start when I thought my parents, mainly my dad, my mom was never abusive, would turn into wear wolves when I would turn my back, everytime I turned around I thought they were sneaking up on me claws over their heads about to eat me, I would often follow them around and try to catch them, I had a fear of being alone because I always thought they were going to get me if I wasn't paying attention. this continued until around 10 or 11, I don't know why that thought process stopped but it just did.\n\nI know my dad was also verbally abusive but I can't really remember specifics I just know it happened often. Things like don't be a pussy or don't be such a girl with the occasional smack upside the head and such. I was a very sensitive child and wished i had been a girl, maybe because my sister didn't get it as bad as I did, I'm not 100% sure why those thoughts started so early but they were vivid.\n\nAround 9 the abuse started changing and progressing into more abrubt violence, less spankings more being thrown against walls and choked although I can remember only two times this happened I wouldn't be suprised if it was more often, smacks across the head, the verbal abuse escalated into more of a bully harassing way, he would do things to just tease or torment me, specific memories are hard to clear up enough to get a good picture, I remember one time he showed me a pressure point on my foot and refused to let go, I was crying it hurt so bad and ended up hitting him in the face and then he lost his temper idk stuff like that. The inappropriate behavior of exposing me to adult things like porn and inappropriate movies, letting me drink a beer or some wine, no sexual abuse I can remember so that's a relief. I started being more aware of his behavior and knowing he was wrong most of the time , I didn't like the way he would treat people in public, he was very racist, he would often put my mom down, they divorced when I was 7. I also started talking back more and challenging him and he seemed to for the most part loose interest in me, I would often leave the house and spend most of the day with friends in the neighborhood. I had very little parental oversight at this point after the divorce and would mainly fend for myself most of the time. By 8 or 9 during summers I was mostly left to do what I wanted, my sister was there but she was a teen and barley kept tabs on me.\n\nMy suicidal ideation started around 11 In middle school where I was bullied a lot, the change in the social behavior didn't really click for me until around 8th grade when I taught myself how to be accepted. I started drinking often on weekends in 8th grade, smoking cigarettes by 9th I discovered weed and that was my miracle cure, I couldn't stand ever not being high or drunk and almost all of high-school was just one big party that lasted 10 years too long. I was lucky I never enjoyed the harder stuff besides my love of cocain but it never became too much of an issue. At 15 the end of my relationship with my father happened, he picked me up from school when I was sick and we got in a fight where he punched me several times in the face and I jumped from his moving car, he never got in trouble for it, my mom and sister begged me not to press charges and that was pretty much the end of my relationship with them as well, since the defended him, my sister took his side and my mom who is a push over just wanted the drama to go away and kept trying to get me to forgive him, I lost all respect for either of them and realized I was on my own. That pretty much set up my teen years of balls to the wall not thinking I would live past 18 and to be honest I'm pretty suprised I did, multiple arrests and forced rehab probably ended up saving me. \n\nI don't know how to feel about all of this, there isn't an emotion to describe any of it, it just makes me feel sick to my stomach. I know it's pretty screwed up but it's hard to see it, it was just my life, that's just what it was."

        "text":"Stuck in bed today, disassociating, conversion disorder acting up. It is so frustrating as I have a child and a husband and cats and a house to clean. We send my toddler to daycare 4 days a week so I can keep my anxiety levels down and get things done (OCD and I have post partum anxiety that ramps up when I am with her for too many days, so cleaning is important and time alone). Also to keep her safe if I get like this.  \n\nI need\/want to do things today and was looking forward to it. I tried drinking coffee and putting the phone away and doing a small task but my body and brain are saying \"nope\". So now it is 2:24 p.m. and I am in bed, pj's still, not a thing done, teeth not brushed even, and my legs are spasming from the conversion disorder while my brain feels like it is being squeezed. However I can think clearly and type (albeit slowly). \n\nMy body wants to go to sleep again but I just slept 11 hours that I didn't want to. I can't figure out a trigger. I track my moods and activities and avoid any and all triggers, yet here I am. It has been 3 years. I am so sick of this. \n\nJust need to vent. Someone tell me what to do? I cannot get up (well I can but tell my brain that) because my body thinks I have a disease or am paralysed\/blind\/deaf all because my brain is confusing it. Arrghhh.\n\nEdit: aaand a pseudo-seizure is starting. Anyone else with conversion disorder with PTSD onset? "

        "text":"Finally getting help I had some childhood trauma.  And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   \n\nI injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  \n\nWell the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  \n\nLuckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. \n\nI looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) \n\n When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  \n\nI went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a \"cookie cutter\" plan.\n\nThey explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. \n\nAfter going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  \n\nThey truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  \n\nThey also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    \n\nWith their help I have been clean 3.5 months.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. \n\nSo today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.\n\nFor the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future.... And it gets brighter every day!!! \n\n(Pic of text from mmj doc)\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2ExSSv4.png"
