[{"id":"1400_ptsd","text":"Can PTSD lead to psychosis? Here I am again. I've been posting on reddit before about my severe anxiety and fear of psychosis.\n\nBut still, as a background note:\nI am a 23 year old woman, currently unemployed, with no history of psychosis\/schizophrenia in my family, but with history of trauma (bullying, abusive father, parental divorce, neurological illness of my twin brother). I'm currently living with my mother and twin brother.\n\nSo, because of the whole covid quarantine, I engaged in online therapy. I contacted a clinician psychologist  via a mental health website following a video evaluation and a series of tests for diagnosis. \nAfter all of them, I scored very high in most anxiety disorders which are: PTSD (highest), health anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and OCD.\nI also did a psychosis test which came out with 0 points result, meaning that I have no hallucination or delusion.\nShe adviced me to continue talk therapy and (optional) medication but accentuated the talk therapy. \n I'm currently still trying to save some money for the upcoming sessions so right now I can't attend them.\n\nThe thing is this: for the past month I've been dealing with derealization and been stuck inside my head all day.\nI have a huge fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia after accidentally coming across on google while searching for symptoms of dissociation.\n\nAs mentioned, I don't have hallucinations or delusions, but I experience some things maybe related to my PTSD. For example:\n- when my brother doesn't answer my phonecalls I get a panic attack and racing thoughts about something terribly happening to him (he is diagnosed with epilepsy).\n- I tend to avoid songs, places, movies, topics that remind myself of my trauma experiences, otherwise I think they might reoccur.\n- I have a tic that's lip picking, when i'm stressed or bored.\n- I have agoraphobia due to a traumatic event when I passed out 5 years ago (due to hypoglycemia) and always go out feeling tense and stuck in my head.\n- when I get derealization, I struggle to focus on my surroundings and my speech.\n- when I send a text to a friend or say something that might upset them, I think about that a lot of get scared of them wanting to distance from me (it happens only ocasionally, but it's still concerning me).\n- being stuck in my head, I became a bit less responsive to conversations with my family.\n\nMy traumas were triggered when I was 9,13,14 and 18.\nEver since the evaluation, I began to think a little more clear about my mental state but I still have the psychosis themed fear and the idea of losing my mind or losing control of myself terrifies me.\nIn the past year my self esteem has been very affected, I don't feel in control of myself and feel like I lost my independent life; I feel the need to rely on my mother and brother. Before that, I used to trust myself and my mother and brother relied on me too. They still do, but I feel like I'm the one who can't rely on myself.\nAll of this happened after getting the psychosis fear.\n\nI read somewhere that PTSD can come with secondary psychosis in a much higher rate than in general population and it scared me badly considering my phobia.\nI feel like I need more information on this, as my fear convinces me that because I have PTSD, I might get psychosis too.\nAre there any important details about this? Does psychosis in PTSD manifest the same way as in regular psychosis? Why do some PTSD sufferers develop it and other PTSD sufferers don't?\nDoes my personal case suggest I might develop psychosis?"},{"id":"1401_ptsd","text":"I think I have an episode of PTSD. Help is appreciated. Hello.\nI live in a very unsafe country. I grew accustomed somehow to the hazardous risk of my daily life (due to rampant deliquency) and fortunately, due to my residence in an upscale neighborhood, I haven't been really that exposed to the real face of danger.\nNonetheless, tonight, while scrolling down the timeline on Twitter, I came across this gory video of a young man (way too young, a teenager) been brutally beheaded after what looks like a horribly agonizing execution.\nIt seems it was the by-product of mafia wars but it occured in my home country, fortunately, far away from the capitol city.\nHowever, the video shocked me so much that I can't really think of other things now. I'm really paranoid now that someone could break into my house and subject me to such a dreadful death. I'm paranoid about the domestic employee (from a poor side of the city) to gang up with others to assault on me in order to steal from me or something like that. It got to the point that I felt like throwing up at least a good half an hour after watching the video.\n\nI have never considered myself sensitive to this kind of material. Actually I had watched several of them in the past but this one really hit home. \n\nI believe the paranoid thoughts (which I never had) and feeling unsafe for my dog and myself (due to a good part of the population being deprived of proper food and healthcare) are an episode of PTSD.\n\nI want to thank all of the police officers, especially those fighting organized-crime for the daunting risk they take on our behalf.

Long-time lurker, first-time poster to this subreddit. \n\ntl;dr - spent more time being looked after by day-cares than my home, dealt with some fucked up things and I'm not sure what to do or if it's even worthy of direct help. Looking for advice.\n\nI've been seeing a therapist for general anxiety, OCD and depression, as well as treating ADHD and some learning disabilities. I have no idea how to breech this subject with my therapist because I feel like I've already dumped a bunch on her and I feel like I'm just asking for attention at this point. \n\nBasically, I have a specific old memory from my childhood that haunts me every single day. I was a military kid of a single mom, and spent a lot of time away from her and was looked after by babysitters, was placed in daycares, etc. I don't resent her at all - I love my mom with everything I have! She was my whole world and still is. It was very difficult to have to be separated from her and I wound up in the care of mean or neglectful babysitters and a few day-cares where I had some gross encounters. TW details to follow:&gt;!I know I was sexually abused by a handful of older kids several times at a particular day-care (Mom DID learn about this and tried to do something but didn't\/couldn't pull me out of the daycare), and I know I had a minor situation happen with a cousin during a period my mother wasn't mentally well and they were visiting\/looking after me (Mom DOESN'T know about this, I don't want to tell her). The memory that TRULY haunts me during this period of my life is from a particular babysitter's home. We (4-5 other kids) were left alone all the time in the babysitter's basement. There was another child who was 2 or 3 that they looked after, and he fatally abused several of the babysitter's pets while we were left alone. I was 5 or 6 and could do  nothing but watch. I blocked it out until I was 10 and owned a pet - that's when I'd say it truly began to haunt me. I didn't tell my mother until a few weeks ago, and I was even more vague talking about it than I'm being here.!&lt;\n\nI pushed this event aside as an intrusive thought and told myself it was nothing more, but it HAUNTS me. DAILY. It feels like I'm there. For a split second I hear things, I feel things, I see everything, it takes over my vision, my bones, my guts, I feel physically and emotionally for the animals. I gasp, I plug my ears, I cry, I panic. At home alone or in public, on the bus, at work. And it loops like my other intrusive thoughts. I think about it once and it takes minutes or hours to cool off. When things IRL remind me of it (area carpets, certain animals, roadkill, certain gestures), it's like I'm FORCED to think about it again. I'm freaking my husband out with it lately, I know. I had to open up to him about it recently because it flaired up a few weeks ago and I was crying in bed and it was torture because it is so incredibly difficult to talk about it. \n\nSubconsciously I know a lot of my current issues are because I was left alone with strangers so much as a child and I kept a lot of went on from my mom when I could. Compared to other people's stories I feel ashamed posting here looking for direction, and as badly as I'd like to talk to my therapist about this, I don't know if it's worth it. It's not like she can do anything about the memory itself, right? It's not like my other intrusive thoughts that are purely fictional. This is something that happened and nothing can change it. But I can't handle this plaguing me anymore. \n\nI want help and I have no idea if THIS is even the best place to start. \n\nI appreciate any advice.

I'm not sure whether talking with her on the phone or through some videoconferencing application (such as Skype) would be something you could do in the meantime until you sort out what you want to do.Some things I wonder are:What makes the two of them not get along?What makes him feel threatened or on edge if you visit your mother without him? What does he think will happen?What is he getting out of trying to choose for you?What is he so afraid of?If you decide to talk about these things with your boyfriend, try to do the following:Consider using questions that start with the words who, what, where, when, and not why. The word why can be really difficult for some people to answer because the word itself triggers an emotional reaction.Try to ask him if the two of you can discuss this in a way that you can just ask more questions about what he is experiencing. If you can listen without being defensive about what you think and feel, you may understand more about where you boyfriend is coming from.Remember that understanding what he means does not mean that you have to agree with what he is saying.Maybe he would be willing to listen to what you are experiencing and ask questions about that as you did for him. It would be good to do this in a way similar to what an investigative reporter would do and asking questions that cannot be answered in a yes or no format and require more information.I'm sure this is putting you in a very tough place.

I was supposed to spend the night and watch my niece tomorrow (she and my nephew live with my mom ~ my brothers kids) just to spend time with them. I told her before she left that I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to stay the night and asked her if that was ok. She said it was fine she would have someone to watch my niece. After she picked me up she pretty much spent the entire day guilting me and telling me to stay the night. It was obviously making me uncomfortable and feel like shit and I asked her to stop - she wouldn\u2019t. \n\nI mean that was just when she was being nice. My niece was in the car too and my mom kept finding reasons to raise her voice and get frustrated with her. I was constantly having to tell her that N wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.

I was just in shock because N was saying over and over M was hurting and it wasn\u2019t until I said something that she stopped.

Then for some reason, it started to become rocky and this is when my episodes really ramped up.

I would get so mad and upset and irrational and he would too. After my worst flashback he did not speak to me for 2 weeks - because he needed space.

You internalize it and accept it as your reality.\u00a0The first step is to evaluate the people close to you, especially your parents. Even if you are an adult, think back to your childhood. Children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems. The obvious, such as being abused, can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem, but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a person.You may have never been physically or sexually abused, but what about emotionally? Were you yelled at, berated, put down? Were you told you'd never amount to anything? Were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short, couldn't live up to expectations? When you hear something over and over again, you start to believe it.Maybe you weren't yelled at. Maybe it was the opposite. Studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect. A chronically depressed mother, for example, may have seemed cold, detached, emotionless. She may have been less likely to show interest in a child's life, not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances.\u00a0If one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up, chances are, a lot of the attention went to them, which could have led to your needs not being met.Any of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant, unheard, unloved, or like they don't matter.Maybe nothing I've described here fits your situation. If you can't pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own, a counselor can help.I am not saying \"blame it on your parents\" or telling you there's nothing you can do to change it! Quite the opposite! Understanding WHY you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better. Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition - figure out the WHY. Then behavior - the HOW.\u00a0"},{"id":"1426_incel","text":"Graves in his Greek myths points out that the Athenians made Athena's virginity the symbol of the invincible of their city for which they disguised the primitive myths in which they point to it as outraged by Poseidon and denied that she had children with the god Hephesus.  It is possible that Athena was part of the triple goddess of matriarchy acting as a nymph, with the arrival of the Hellenic conquest these primitive myths were suppressed and Athena was regenerated into a virginal maiden.  Something similar happens with Artemis, the maiden virgin and deer hunter, before having that title she was a totemic nymph-goddess in the primitive matriarchal societies to which orgies and sacrifices were dedicated before of being regenerated into a virgin goddess.  The other goddesses like Aphrodite, Demeter and Persephone would be vestiges of the matriarchal cults that the Hellenes adopted, These influences had the repercussion of the feminization of customs hellenic Sparta before this was a reaction against this feminization, against the decline of civilization and the last vestige of patriarchy in its purest form.  From her conception, the Spartan woman was subjected to harsh training as men, but unlike them, his education was severe but did not reach the degrees of violence than male training.  It is ironic and it is something that modern feminists are unaware - or simply bothered so much that they are unaware - the fact that in the only pure patriarchy in Greece women enjoyed more freedoms and rights than in other parts of the region.  The Spartan woman boxed, they did wrestling, swimming, gymnastics and dance, participated together with the men in tournaments and games, knew how to read and write, ate the same rations as men, He also had the freedom to choose who he could marry, something unthinkable in other city-states.  This freedom consisted in knowing how to choose the best man to procreate, to the best warrior, that was the concept of sexual freedom that the Indo-Europeans had, know how to choose the best man, the best woman of his race, to continue the lineage.  Due to her education and the severity of her training, Sparta had women most beautiful of its time.  Homer called Sparta \"land of beautiful women\", the Spartan women were known for this extraordinary beauty, austerity and maturity that exceeded women from other regions of Greece."},{"id":"1427_counseling","text":"Fears are not that difficult to deal with, first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy, once you are able to employ that in your daily life, you then need to start facing your fear, for instance I'll use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge. We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said \"I'm scared of snakes\", I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C"},{"id":"1428_ptsd","text":"How can I deal with the ptsd that was caused by my brother commiting suicide Hello everyone this is my first post and I'm nervous talking about this. \n  Anyway back in 2015 my brother killed himself, and I was really close to him.

Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of \"tools\" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time.\u00a0Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? \u00a0Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you."},{"id":"1441_ptsd","text":"I feel like anytime I open up to someone about my PTSD, I scare them off.

There is probably more he is uncomfortable talking to me about, because of my suicidal thoughts, anxiety issues, etc. he has told me he opted not to talk about things in that night in the past if he felt I wasn't in a good place. \n\n\n*I've been trying to get him to get his P.O. box back (moved to different building on base that doesn't do mail) so I can send him some things. He hasn't had the time off working on base.\n\n*helping his sleep schedule - ever changing and demanding schedule stops any routine that could be built\n\n*I'm so far away visiting is a financial question more than anything\n\n*I move there I have to marry him for him to be allowed to stay with me \n\nI also don't want to be too invasive, I check in on he slept that night in my good morning texts, then try to help him talk out dreams or w\/e is on his mind when he brings it up.

Last summer, after a family event\/argument led to domestic violence at home, I decided to move out of the house, where I was living with my twin brother. He had suffered from depression for most of his life, but towards the end, he became increasingly violent and manic. I was scared, and confused, and did what I thought was best for me and my partner at the time, and moved down the street to a new apt. The next day, after working, and not hearing from him, I started to get a sick feeling in my stomach. I ignored it for a few hours, drinking water and laying down, but the sick feeling grew into something else that I can\u2019t describe. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard stories of twins sensing each other, especially in times of distress. It\u2019s rare, but I\u2019m telling you, that shit is very real. So I walked over to our house, and he didn\u2019t answer the door. It was a Tuesday night. He was 32. We were 32.\n\nMy actual experience is something too horrible and sad to describe in detail, but I did find him, and I\u2019m the one who went in, and raised him up, and took him off of that rope. That tangible, physical experience, mixed with the tragedy of losing my twin brother, my best friend, who I spent my entire childhood with, has left me deeply traumatized. There\u2019s an element to it that took part of my identity itself, as a twin, I\u2019m now now longer part of a set. I\u2019m half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. How do I continue to be a twin without my match? Is a set still a set, once you apply subtraction? Am I still a twin now that he is gone?\n\nMy trauma experience is a nightmare, literally. My dreams manifest things I don\u2019t even want to go into, and I\u2019ve never been so aware of how many times suicide is mentioned in films, television, even comedy. It\u2019s everywhere, and the suicide rates among young people are at unprecedented levels. My triggers induce a deep breath in me, at the mention of the word, or image, or a roped off front yard, Dad attempting to make the grass grow. Or a bread tie. Or a dog collar. It\u2019s weird how things manifest like that. Unfortunately the mystery leaves me vulnerable to crying episodes in public, or leaving social gatherings early, and unannounced. I attempted to continue to suck it up, and be social, but my loss made me nervous, confused, empty. It left me empty. But, like the dry chalice might be considered to be empty, perhaps the purpose of the chalice, is to be filled. And so it flows into me...\n\nIt taught me to see truth a little clearer, but this has been hard. Truth requires self reflection first, self truth, whatever that means to you. I had to look hard at myself in order to deal with my grief and my guilt, and I know I\u2019ll struggle to understand these issues for the rest of my life. I\u2019ve been writing and reading about suicide, bipolar disorder (which he had), consciousness, empathy, truth, friendships, spirituality, and sorrow to try to process all of this. \n\nI never could have imagined being in this place, on this island. At first, many were supportive, but slowly I became more and more isolated, feeling like no one possibly could understand what I was going through. I slowly lost most of the people in my life, not because they didn\u2019t care, but because they didn\u2019t have the capacity to show it, they just didn\u2019t know how. Who could blame them? I was confrontational, angry, sad, confused, and hoping someone was going to make it better for me. But it wasn\u2019t about anyone else, if I was going to ever feel good again, it was going to be ME who made that happen. It\u2019s amazing how everything can turn on a dime, and never return. It\u2019s like, when he died, he took this..  thing... from me. What it is, I can\u2019t name, but it\u2019s gone for sure, and I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not coming back. So what do I do with it, this emptiness? I walk with it. Literally. I walk and walk the trails on this island all day. It\u2019s winter now, so it\u2019s much colder, and my walks are filled with less pauses, but I persist. \n\nI\u2019m in therapy, sometimes several times a week. I do not consume alcohol or hard drugs. I use particular psychedelics with a therapeutic intent, and have experienced profound revelations that have been helpful in moving my mind in a more conscious and positive direction. I take natural herbal supplements for energy and mood balancing, but I find that exercising in a natural environment is the best thing for me therapeutically. I\u2019m lucky to be young enough to be so mobile. \n\nI\u2019ve slowly shed all social media, FB, IG, etc, because I found it to contribute to my anxiety, my isolation, and resentment. I was constantly trying to openly share, self examine, and had hopes that others would reciprocate. But people don\u2019t really want to do that. It\u2019s super uncomfortable, and most would rather be distracted by the game, or their phone, or a drink. Finally, after a point in which I felt like what I was saying fell on deaf ears, I decided to no longer share with those who couldn\u2019t hear it anymore. My therapist brought to mind the biblical concept \u201ccast ye your pearls before swine\u201d.  Of course I\u2019m not saying my words are gospel, and in fact, I offer no advice to anyone, this is all purely my experience and expression. \n\nIn fact, I\u2019m in distress a lot, and I\u2019m not saying that any of this made me a \u201cbetter person\u201d, I\u2019m saying it made me wake the fuck up to myself, and what I was doing. Things don\u2019t get easier, they just get different. Tragedy sometime can birth strength, but often times, tragic events do not make people better, stronger, or more aware, in fact it often makes us more disconnected, more isolated, feeling like we\u2019re unique, and our pain is unique. Victims of trauma can\u2019t be put into order in a filing cabinet, there\u2019s no sense to be made of it. Some are resentful of those thriving, saying \u201cthat\u2019s not my experience\u201d. Of course it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just yours. And this is just mine. And although my situation and personality are unique, I find my pain isn\u2019t. The whole world is suffering suffering. My pain might just disappear, like a drop becomes the ocean, in the great vastness of collective consciousness, if I can release myself of the burden through empathy. Might any of us be strong enough to let the ocean completely envelop us? \n\nSo it\u2019s been a few weeks now since I\u2019ve been free from Instagram and Facebook, and my urge to check a screen, my addiction to check in on these carefully manicured presentations of digital life, has faded. Leaving me again, more room to be filled with the good things I enjoy in life. Playing my guitar, and reading Melville in the bathtub, meditating outside, walking the sandy trails with the rabbits, listening to my favorite records, and most importantly, spending time with my loving and compassionate partner, who is the most selfless, understanding soul in my whole world. Without love, I would have perished along with my brother, but it\u2019s love that kept me alive, and keeps me going. If I can learn to love myself truly, I know I\u2019ll survive. \n\nI hope to someday find a way to have a PTSD service dog, although it seems unlikely, due to the cost of training one properly (about $20K). I absolutely love dogs, and I think about adopting one frequently, but again, it\u2019s so hard for me to initiate important things, I can\u2019t even imagine starting this process. A good friend of mine has a couple hounds who love me, and make me super happy, so sometimes, when I\u2019m really down, I just go lay on the floor over at his house, and let the dogs go to town licking me and climbing all over me. It\u2019s so sensational and wonderful, I smile just writing about it. A pure, simple, wholesome joy. \n\nI\u2019m not past the pain, I\u2019m just finding out better ways in which to navigate it. Some days, the seas are choppy, but at least the sails are full. The shores of the seas of my mental landscape, are lined by a great, \u201cmental forest\u201d. My twin brother was a great tree in my forest, and hard he fell, but that break in the canopy has given my forest new growth. Exotic species sprout from the sunlit patch spontaneously, and they invite me in, and we become one, and I enjoy the sun with them while I can. \n\nAre you in pain?

After 2yrs, I finally got her to a doctor so she could start an anti-depressant regiment. I didn\u2019t just push her to do it, thinking it would change everything. When we began dating, we had known each other for a few months (work), and anxiety was apparent. I learned of her PTSD and Depression shortly into the relationship. I deal with depression myself, so I wasn\u2019t about to give up on someone for things they can\u2019t control. I was clear with her of my goal for her in our relationship: to be happy and healthy.\n\nHer family life is almost non existent, and she has moved around most of her life. She severed ties with (some of) the abusive relationships in her life about 2 years ago. We moved in together because we spent most of our time together and we wanted to save money. It\u2019s been almost 2 years living together (after only 8-10 months of dating). Cracks are beginning to show.\n\nWe have two roommates, who I like very much. She always got along with them until recently. Our apartment is 2 couples, M-F \/ M-F. It\u2019s a two bedroom, so yes, it gets a little cramped, even though its a big place, one bathroom is a constant pest. \n\nLately (past 6 months), the girl living with us has made it clear about keeping things clean, using our own appliances.. usual passive-aggressive roommate stuff. I\u2019m used to it, I do NOT take it personally from the girl, we still chat in a very friendly way frequently, and I\u2019m good friends with her boyfriend. I see these grievances as small troubles, roommates setting boundaries, etc.\n\nWe have lived with this couple for the entirety of us living together. Problems just started to arise about 6 months ago. The girl would get pissed at messy bathroom, moldy stuff in fridge, etc. NEVER became vocal about these problems. Began to show some passive aggressive behavior: Slamming bathroom door, leaving notes, sending TWO texts, JUST TWO over a few months.\n\nI see this stuff as normal, my girlfriend is losing her mind. The slamming of bathroom doors led to her having flashbacks of her shitty father. I spoke with the roommate, and explained the situation. It stopped happening. The girl asked that my GF start using her own electric kettle due to overlapping morning schedules. My GF\u2019s electric kettle was given to her by one of her attackers at her last apartment. That was hard to explain to girl, so we gave it away to avoid more triggers for my girlfriend.\n\nNow, my girlfriend is being triggered by the girl loudly doing her own dishes. This, I had to make a stand on. They were not my gf\u2019s dishes. She had no dogs in the fight. Yet she blamed her INCREDIBLE anger where she stormed into our room and stayed for the night, on loud dish-doing. \n\nMy girlfriend is not a clean person. I can deal with it, try to get her to clean, but it is not my roommates\u2019 fault that she is this way. \n\nThe girl left a note on a tupperware container tonight saying \u2018PLEASE DISPOSE\u2019 and my girlfriend lost it. Inside? A month of veggie smoothie mix that had a lump of mold in it so large that I couldn\u2019t wash it down the sink, I had to pick it out and trash it.\n\nMy girlfriend? Threw a fit and LEFT IT OUT on the counter. Walked away from it. Meanwhile the moldy cup in the living room I asked her to clean will start a fight if I bring it up. \n\nThe note? She wrote 'FUCK OFF' on it, then threw it away out of regret(?). Left it for me (I guess?) to clean, like everything else.\n\n\nThis escalation between the girl and my GF is getting out of hand. We are moving in 6months. I believe that my GF is overreacting and its unnecessary anger, stress, and confusion adding to the situation. \n\nI have stood by my GF for almost 3 years. I have read about PTSD, slowly pushed her towards treatment (finally got her to the Dr for anti-depressants, she hadn\u2019t been to a Dr in many many years). I have tried (slowly) to get her to therapy.. we made a few appointments that she canceled (a while ago). \n\nI feel like my GF isn\u2019t trying. She is being overloaded. She is also being selfish and rude when that is in NO WAY the person I knew years ago. I have been patient with her conditions. I have tried nothing but to help her. I have made stands on some things (almost exclusively cleaning, especially our room that looks like a disaster area, due to her). I\u2019m approaching the end of my rope. Completely ignoring me begging her for years to clean, explaining that it stresses me out the way her triggers do, is starting to really piss me off and make me feel like she doesn't care about my happiness if it means an ounce of work for her. \n\n**TL;DR** My GF is freaking out over my roommate\u2019s recent actions. I believe it is a completely irrational response. I have taken triggers into consideration, but believe she is being selfish and closing off. I have tried to help her as much as possible, but I have my fears that if this is how she acts now, what will our future (on a different coast we\u2019re moving to) hold. That fear has me questioning our future, viability, health, etc.\n\nAny input would help. I can\u2019t possibly say I fully understand PTSD, but I have tried for years to help her, and plan to continue. I feel insensitive when claiming a trigger or her anxiety in certain situations if irrational, but I truly feel this has been. I can give more specifics about her PTSD. Apologies for throwaway, want to protect her privacy. \n\nThanks\n"},{"id":"1478_counseling","text":"I was raped repeatedly when I was younger.

That hit the nail in the coffin and the realisation hit me like a train. I wanted to throw up, curl in a ball and scream, and cry.... After 2 months of torture on my part I finally told my mum. While this happened my grandfather(abuser) frequently visits and calls almost everyday. I get panic attacks everytime it's brought up or if I'm reminded of it in some way... The guilt and shame is killing me. So it's really hard for me to express and talk about my feeling about my... Situation\n\nI can't take it anymore.

Suffering from   PTSD the last nine years (outset was six months after turning 21). Doing   EMDR therapy which is helping but therapist had to take two week off  so  some issues, so I am seeing myself start to fade into my old ways  and  I'm not happy about it. This treatment seems to be one of the most   effective treatments so far so I am hoping it helps me.\n\nI   have had really bad social issues the last nine years since the PTSD.   It got progressively worse around 24 years of ago. I used to maintain   somewhat of a network of friends. However, I deactivated all social   media platforms which may be actually a good idea and have not made much   of an effort to make friends. Lot of my former friends are screw ups   and other ones are narcissist kinds of all people.\n\nIn   order to better myself and try to meet people, I Joined the gyms,   worked out, went to only one meetup (thinking about going to others) and   just job hoped leaving jobs after no time at all due to this PTSD   bullshit. Resume is completely bullshitted by a few people I know who   own other businesses.\n\nI do make   money though and I do so by my online business in eCommerce  which has   been growing but my B.A degree hasn't done much if anything for me.   Didn't meet many women the last three years of school unless they were   online I was so psychologically fucked up.\n\nSo   as far as relationships since this is a relationship sub-reddit, I  have  dated all the wrong kinds of women. I am guessing that is because  of my  own problems and maybe I can contribute some of it to bad luck, I  am  not sure. I have dated mostly narcissistic women who don't give a  flying  fuck about anyone but themselves.\n\nI   have met a lot of them online and have not met many women offline in   probably five years or so. My two close friends I still keep in touch   with can't introduce me to any women. I had a girl I went to high school   with who apparently suffering from Boarderline personality disorder   call the police on me and lie saying I was suicidal. Well, she   technically had someone else (a third party as the police said) call the   police and tell them I told the individual I was suicidal. It was big   pile of shit and all lies. She was projecting her feelings of suicidal   on to me after I told her I will never speak to her anyway because she   has no empathy at all.\n\nSo all   these years, I've spent time having sex and or going to strip clubs and   engaging in sex with escorts. I have completely fucked up the way I  look  at women. I went from a kid who had good morals to a complete con  man  and liar. My grandfather was in organized crime and I have been  having  the worst feeling that I could end up like him due to the way I  am  turning out. I have no criminal record but have gotten into issues  with  the police and other law enforcement tasks force. I always managed  to  escape getting any record.\n\nI   almost feel like the way I look at most women is that they only give a   fuck about money and that is it. I never wanted to believe this shit  but  I am from Connecticut and people without money here, don't make  much of  any good life for themselves. For the past decade, I planned on  moving  down South as much of my family is living down there. I don't  fucking  know. For the most part, I have lots of issues with  relationships and I  think by reading my post, you can tell them.\n\nObviously,   goes back to my childhood so I am hoping this EMDR therapy helps (have   an appointment this Wednesday).

I'll start by saying I moved out right at 18, but ages 19-21 have always been hard to remember. I'm 37. Before now, I could tell an occasional story about those years but I couldn't ever get a timeline to make sense for me and never wanted to delve too deep into it.

It was to the point where up until recently, the information about where I thought lived during part of that time would have even been wrong. Now I'm being flooded with memories of a time I now know I didn't want to remember. I don't want them. \n\nIt also makes me question my reality.

He wanted a BJ so bad but I said no and he was so mad. We saw a play and he was just grumpy and mean. I went to visit him in his state and I loved his family but he would demand BJs. He asked if he needed to get condoms but I said I didnt want to have sex. I was on my period too so I think its why he didnt do more to me. I always wanted to go to Sedona and Lowell Observatory and he took me there on our trip but he locked me in the hotel room, we never went to the observatory or even Lowell. He made me grind\/ride him topless and him naked (no penetration) and blow him. He wouldn't cuddle me or let me on the porch. I cried a lot. We went on a fun jeep trip and drove back home. He kept wanting the blowjobs and I remember we watched a movie and I cried on the floor please one night just nothing and he cupped my crying face and tilted me up and said \"but think about how id feel\" and pushed me down. He grinded into me and I felt himself kinda push in trough my underwear and I felt scared.

Prior to that, in high school, I was very promiscuous (possibly as a result of taking medication meant for depression while actually being bipolar, perhaps sending me into a mania).\n\nIn my drug phase, there were lots of times I\u2019d have sex for drugs. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t expect it - thinking that I could just pay the guy for my drugs like a normal transaction, but they ended up not wanting the money and I\u2019d give in. \n\nthe climax of it all happened when I was desperately looking for a fix and this guy happened to see me sitting on the street, pulled up in his car and after talking to him, said he could help. I got in the car (I know, stupid as hell) and he ended up getting me a handful of pills. I didn\u2019t know what they were, but I downed all of them. I passed out and then when I woke up, we were hundreds of miles away from where we originally met and he proceeds to explain to me that I\u2019m \u201cgoing to be working for him now\u201d. He was a pimp. \n\nI spent the next few weeks in that situation - he took my cell phone, kept me drugged up, woke me up at 8am everyday to start working until the late hours of night. He\u2019d yell at me if I had any bruises from someone being too rough with me. \n\nI had tried to kill my self then, but it didn\u2019t work and woke up to him screaming at me about it.\n\nThe only way I was able to contact anyone was when I had developed an infection in my arm from IV drug use and he finally (after days of this) agreed to take me to the ER. I called my family from there and thankfully he agreed to just drop me off at the airport where they would pick me up.\n\nI\u2019ve talked about this many times in counseling, but it\u2019s always been like I was talking about the weather. No emotion behind it, just nonchalantly telling the story.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until very recently that I thought about the whole situation and realized that I had been kidnapped. That yes, I was looking for drugs and that was bad, but I was kidnapped and taken captive and used.\n\nSince this realization, I\u2019ve been having flashbacks, especially during sex. And having sex is a whole different can of worms for me - lots of times, my body doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything. It\u2019s like I\u2019m still in prostitution mode, where I act like I\u2019m enjoying it but really can\u2019t wait for it to be over. The only way I can get off is by imagining my partner having sex with other people - it\u2019s like I can\u2019t allow myself and my own body to experience pleasure. Imagining things like that make me feel like a creep and it takes\nsomething that\u2019s supposed to be intimate and skews it into this fucked up thing.\n\n\nLast night, I felt it came to a head. I was having sex with my boyfriend and just began having flashbacks of my time as a prostitute - seeing images of guys putting money on the table, disassociating from my body and I then felt this sensation of such anger that I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted to bit my boyfriend across the face, scratch him, grab his face hard. I feel so terrible about it. I started crying and then of course that ruined the moment and the poor guy had no idea what was going through my head.\n\nHe knows some of what I\u2019ve been through, but there\u2019s so much he doesn\u2019t know and doesn\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t blame him. \n\n\nI want to enjoy sex again. I\u2019m seeing a therapist and am on medication for bipolar, but this shit just haunts me.

When you're 18, you're legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place.\u00a0Honestly, teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements. Since you didn't specify more on the situation, I have no idea what your specific situation is. Were your parents ever married? Are they separated or divorced? Was there ever a court hearing for custody? Not all couples have an official court order arrangement. All families are different, too. Was there abuse between your parents? Towards you by one of them? Does either of them have addiction issues, major health or mental health issues, or anything like that? You mentioned that you want to live with your mom, but didn't say why. Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom? Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one, or is there something else going on? This isn't a decision that should be placed entirely on you, and it also isn't a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input. But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you.\u00a0Whatever you do, hang in there! 18 will be here before you know it. Focus on that. Freedom. College. Plan for your future that YOU control, and focus on making it the best it can be. Do not let the anxiety and depression cloud your thoughts and make you do something irreversible."},{"id":"1527_ptsd","text":"Fear when attracted to someone So, ladies and gentlemen, is there anyone here that experiences some symptoms of great fear when being around a particular individual you fancy?

You do have the option of reporting this person to the appropriate licencing board in your state. The other concern is if this person has unauthorized access to your credit card.

A family member mentioned something about possible sexual abuse, but this topic is very avoided by our family, so it\u2019s never discussed. \n\nMy older brother (29) was seriously affected by the abuse he endured, and now has his own set of struggles and problems he faces as an adult. This includes uncontrollable anger, violence to his girlfriend, screaming, throwing things (anything from a mug to a dinner chair) around when things don\u2019t go his way, threatening suicide, and more. I lived with him and my mom for a few years like this and this caused me to be very sensitive to noise, particularly made by men. I don\u2019t live with them anymore. I have been afraid and wary of men for my whole life, and part of me wants to keep it that way for my safety even though I know it causes me a lot of pain in my every day of life.\n\nWithout getting too into details, my long distance girlfriend (22) visited a BDSM dungeon to learn what it was about and instantly had a 70 year old man infatuated with her. He invited her to his house to teach her, and I strongly discouraged her from going. After an impact play session at the dungeon and some time, she asked me if she could go to his house for more sessions because he wanted it so badly. We all agreed for it all to be nonsexual, no penetration, clothed, just impact play. \n\nThis man consistently pushed the boundaries of what we were comfortable with. He would touch her in areas we said he couldn\u2019t, he always put our discussions about the sessions into a VERY sexual context, and he was extremely possessive of my girlfriend. He\u2019d deny all of this when we discussed it, citing his many many years of time in the BDSM scene making what he was doing okay and normal.\n\nOne of the sessions, I was getting so anxious for my girlfriend\u2019s safety, I asked if I could watch on video chat the whole time. I almost regret this, because watching that happen was absolutely horrible. I was holding back tears the whole time, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I did all I could to not completely freak out. I was shaking after the session and could barely speak, even though all I had done was watch. \n\nHe continued to call the session a threesome that evening and that was the final straw for me. I already had an extreme aversion to the idea of sex with men, especially old men, and I couldn\u2019t handle that. I messaged my girlfriend that night that I wouldn\u2019t be able to watch any more of their sessions.\n\nSome time passed, she had one or two more sessions with him (I tried to think about it as little as possible while it was going on so I wasn\u2019t keeping count), and my girlfriend moved for school in early fall. After a while, I believed that he was in the past and wouldn\u2019t be a problem again. Eventually, my girlfriend and I discussed this and she realized how creepy this situation actually was, and she felt extremely uncomfortable with how familiar this old man was with her body. We agreed that we shouldn\u2019t have contact with him anymore and she told him this politely in a text. We tried to move on together and leave this in the past.\n\nAnd then he posted photos of her body on a BDSM website without her consent. She asked him to take it down, he refused. After a whole night of pleading him to take it down, we reported it and it disappeared. A couple days later, he posted it again. She got in contact with the dungeon she met him at, which he was actually longterm volunteer for, and they were able to get the photo down and promised my girlfriend they\u2019d keep an eye on his profile and that they\u2019d deal with his situation with the dungeon.\n\nTLDR: Creepy 70 year old man consistently pushes my girlfriend\u2019s and my boundaries during BDSM impact play session and then posts photos of my gf\u2019s body in retaliation of my gf telling him she doesn\u2019t want him in her life anymore.\n\nNow I have an extreme on-sight reaction to any old man even slightly similar to this man. I feel like I\u2019m going to collapse and cry and freak out the second I visually process an old man. The biggest problem is that I work at a drugstore and there are LOTS of old men who use the store. I\u2019m terrified of them and I don\u2019t know how long I can handle these extreme responses I have to seeing them. Nearly of my trauma related reactions have funneled into this and it\u2019s more extreme than anything I\u2019ve experienced before.\n\nThankfully, I will be started EMDR therapy soon, and I really really hope to see improvement one day. I think I might need to quit my job. I feel like I\u2019m going to die when I have to ring up an old man, I can barely speak to them and I can\u2019t look them in the eyes. I\u2019ve cried throughout typing this and I am so scared about going back to work every single day.\n\nDoes it make sense that my triggers and reactions changed so much just by this situation I didn\u2019t even experience firsthand?"},{"id":"1562_incel","text":"They have to be smv matched with you.

You seem to have some good insight into the situation.The type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers, childhood trauma and\/or abuse or neglect, or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self.  This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy.  I recommend a book titled \u201cBoundaries: Where you end and I begin\u201d by Anne Katherine.  Another book that might be helpful is \u201cCodependent No More\u201d by Melody Beattie.\u00a0In the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely do not enter into another relationship.  Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole, happy, emotionally healthy person on your own.  Needing another person to define you is problematic.  That\u2019s too much to expect from any individual.For a relationship to be healthy and happy, both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own.  That means having a clear sense of self, knowing who you are and what you want, knowing how to set healthy boundaries, and knowing how to meet your own needs.  It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time.  There will be times that they won\u2019t be able to meet your needs.  You have to know how to meet those yourself.\u00a0When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be, eventually the right person will come into your life.

TW: ED I had an eating disorder as a teenager that ran until I was around 21. It went from restricting myself at 14 to only eating \\~1000 calories a day to binging and purging weekly for the next 8 years. 6 months before my trauma, I decided to end it. I started eating more and healthier and lifting weights instead of the \\~80 minutes of cardio a day I was doing. I felt amazing.\n\nThen the trauma happened, and fitness was one of the interests I lost when the depression and PTSD hit. I couldn't sleep and had a very busy schedule, so I relied on (mainly junk) food to get me through all-nighters and long shifts. This turned to a comfort thing where I would down Ben and Jerry's and blame my depression. I couldn't even go back to doing cardio because an elevated heart-rate felt like a panic attack. Unsurprisingly, I gained 15 pounds, which is a lot on my 5'1 body.\n\nIt's been a year and some months, and I'm safe again. I have my degree, a job, my own apartment, and stability. Yet all I want to do is lose this weight I gained. I associate it with the worst year of my life and everything in me wants to just go back to the \"old me\" before the trauma and, in hand, the weight gain. Yet I'm so scared this restriction is going to lead to my eating becoming disordered again.\n\nI have tried dieting, but I can't get myself to use calorie tracking apps and when I get too hungry I just...eat. I don't think about my allotted macros for the day or if I'm above or below my protein goal or if the food I'm eating \"fits in my macros\" anymore. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating with no restrictions and I still have my daily fruits and veggies. I'm also still very into weight-lifting and go to the gym 6 days a week still. I guess I just don't have the passion to diet and exercise like I used to for weight loss, though.\n\nI hear all the time about people with PTSD not eating and withering away because of the traumatic event they had to endure. Has anybody else experienced the opposite, though- relying on food to cope? It's hard for me to relate to most stories about PTSD because so many talk about experiencing nausea and an inability to eat - but the only thing I cared about after my trauma was eating. Maybe my history of heavy restriction caused my appetite increase after the trauma as a way of preventing myself from going down that path again. I don't know."},{"id":"1573_ptsd","text":"TW: violence\/sexual abuse. Is it possible that my anxiety is ptsd related? I (24\/f) grew up in a favela and had some life events happen to me Why I want insight: from the age 15-18 I tried to self-diagnose a bunch but then by 18 I felt like it was just a regular \u201cgrowing up and figuring it out\u201d phase. The one label I have identified with since then is the good ol\u2019 \u201canxiety\u201d. Everyone has it. So in a sense I have felt \u201cnormal\u201d. I have worked through a bunch of things that I attributed to how my parents raised me and I would honestly say that I am a generally happy, positive person.\n\nNow, here is what got me started on thinking about this: A few days ago I did coke for the first time ever (I\u2019m not a druggie. All I have done is the somewhat regular weed and occasional alcohol). No big deal. I didn\u2019t trip out or enjoy it. I simply felt nothing from it. I snorted my last dose of it close to 10PM. At around 3AM I tried to sleep. I was at a cheap motel and in the room next us there were some people having a party and talking a little too loud, walking in and out of the room. Sometimes it sounded like they would be walking into my room \u2014 a thought which I could easily dismiss but a feeling that I couldn\u2019t shake. I was on full-on alert. I felt as if I was going to be \u201cdisturbed\u201d, that something or someone would be making me get up and I was scared. The more I thought of it, the less what I felt seemed cocaine-related, and the more I could think about other times I felt the same way.\n\nSo, here is my background:\nI am from a neigbourhood called Piedade, in Rio de Janeiro. Born and raised there until I was 8\/9 years old. I moved with my family around Brazil until I was 15, at which point we moved to Canada. \nRio is a dangerous (!!!), violent place. My neighbourhood was a favela. Not the worst one but a favela nevertheless. I can recall most nights falling asleep to the sounds of gunshots. I can\u2019t really recall the sound of gunshots nowadays until I hear one. I have been caught up in the line of fire quite a few times. Most of them were on the streets and we would just stay put in corners of the house. Some of them were while I was out on the streets and had to just scoot down in the car or run and hide inside nearby stores. One of my earliest memories is of me being woken up in a hurry by my parents. They just grabbed me and my brother and took us to the bathroom. Our doors and windows were gridded and someone \u2014 or in my memory as a child, something scary \u2014 was banging on them. I honestly don\u2019t remember much of that anymore. Just the paralyzing fear, attentiveness, confusion. What happened was that someone was getting followed by a gang to be killed. We had a big yard and this guy jumped into our property. My parents, who were outside, heard neighbours yelling to warn them and they ran inside to get us. The gang arrived, our neighbor was an ex cop, and a shootout happened all around us. But like I said, it\u2019s mostly a feeling to me.\nWe left Rio when I was 8\/9 and I witnessed a lot less of that type of violence. I continued to witness robberies and assaults. A lot of noisy situations. Looking back at it, robbers tend to make their presences known when they are trying to intimidate people with noise.\nAnyway, that was until I was 15 and we left to come to Canada.\n15 was also just about the age when my dad stopped hitting me. He had some anger bursts for no good reason.\nIn a few instances in Brazil, and once in Canada, I was groped very indiscreetly.\nThen in Canada, once I was 18\/19 I was living alone in a basement. I got out of my shower, heard some loud bangs on my door. I froze. Some people burst through, looked at me, ran away. I was shocked but still managed to call the cops right away. I just couldn\u2019t think properly enough to explain it to them in as much detail as they wanted.\n\nSo here I am today. I have recurring nightmares quite often. I would say I could go a week having nightmares only. Someone usually dies in my dreams. Most times I am killed in it, other times I am the one killing. Occasionally, in these dreams, someone else will die in front of me. In real life when I hear loud noises my mind freezes. If someone is talking to me after a noisy disturbance I can \u201cgo with it\u201d but about 30 seconds to a few minutes later I have to ask them to rewind because I wasn\u2019t \u201cthere\u201d anymore. I have really, really, really light sleep. I feel tired all the time. I don\u2019t like spending nights alone at home. Sometimes not even days. If I do, I keep checking on doors, windows and peep behind curtains. If I\u2019m alone I barely sleep or sleep super late until it\u2019s light out. I don\u2019t feel comfortable in loud places (unless there\u2019s rythm\/music).\n\nAnyway, like I said in the beginning, I am still a generally happy person. My anxiety, other than what I just described above, is not a big part of my life anymore. But also, what I call anxiety I have usually attributed to that \u201cworrying\u201d feeling that I will fail or something will go wrong because of me and my decisions (money, school). So, I guess I am wondering if what I described is something like ptsd or if I am just being dramatic and trying to label myself again. But also, part of me feels as if I have made huge progress with my anxiety and that it shed a light into something hidden deeper \u2014 I have made peace with the things I used to blame for my anxiety, yet some feelings of uneasiness linger on. I was wondering if I could have ptsd to any extent (none or mild to moderate maybe?). \n\nPlease tell me what you think. Personal experiences relating to it and even not relating to it would be appreciated.

We went to urgent care and when we got in the room and the nurse and doctor came in, they basically all panicked and called for him to go in an ambulance to the hospital. We went to the ER and he had a CT scan and was diagnosed with a double pulmonary embolism at age 24 and the doctors said if he hadn\u2019t come in he could have died within the next few days. He ended up being in the hospital for a week and was on blood thinners (still is) and had 3 surgeries to remove the clots, put in a stent, and put in a filter. He recovered really well and is almost back to normal. He\u2019s not able to workout because he\u2019s still on blood thinners, but his lungs are okay now. \n\nI was at the hospital the whole time. Experiencing the trauma of watching my strong, able-bodied man become so sick and weak really scared me. I really thought he might die at some points, because of some possibility of internal bleeding and him possibly not being able to breathe on his own during the surgeries. This is the man I want to marry, and who I want my future to be with, and the idea of him being so fragile really shook me. Normally I am the fragile one.\n\nI feel so guilty for beings so emotional and distraught when he actually did live and is relatively fine now. I didn\u2019t really allow myself to cry except for one night when I went home for a bit to see my family. Now I find myself crying hysterically when I just think about how much I love him... I feel like I should be happy now because he\u2019s okay, but this is worse than when he was actually in the hospital. It\u2019s almost like my love for him triggers my trauma, which makes me feel sick...\n\nNot to mention I ended up having some of my own physical and anxiety responses at the same time as all these feelings surfacing.

I\u2019m new to this sub reddit.\n\n\nI\u2019m 19, and on the last day of January of this year, I got into a car accident. I already had really bad driving anxiety before my accident and depression as well, but this accident just worsened everything. \nI totaled my car. It happened in slow-mode for me, which made it worse. I felt paralyzed, I couldn\u2019t do anything. \nI had the biggest anxiety attack to date. I couldn\u2019t even get out of my car to check on the person I hit (don\u2019t worry, they were all fine. No injuries!) I was shaking, hyper ventilating, and sobbing. The lady came and sat in my car with me and hugged me, helping me through my anxiety attack while I apologized over and over.\nI\u2019m just now seeing a therapist. I have multiple nightmares every night about my accident, and about me getting into accidents (me hitting them) with people I love and where the loved one gets killed because of the accident I caused. I only drive as absolutely needed now and I feel so on edge when I do. I feel.. hyper vigilant. I can\u2019t even be a passenger in another car without freaking out. I can\u2019t watch the other cars on the road, like I used to love doing. I have to close my eyes for the entire ride because i get too panicked otherwise. I grip the sides of the car door\/arm rest until my knuckles turn white. \nI also watched the worst accident I\u2019ve ever seen recently, at my old job where I was a host and I\u2019d hold the door that faced the highway open for people. A car flying down the highway hit another car, causing it to get airborne and flip, and hit a car, which then swerved and hit another car. 3 people died in that accident. I just dropped to the ground and started sobbing, and ended up having another anxiety attack. At work. I couldn\u2019t even be sent home early because I told my mangers I wasn\u2019t ok to drive. \nSo.. yea. I don\u2019t really know where I was going with this, I guess I\u2019m just looking for support. It took me a lot to get my parents to understand that I got diagnosed with PTSD. They told me that there was no way I could have PTSD. But they\u2019re doing better now. \nI don\u2019t really talk about my struggles much, but i feel so defeated and f***ed up. I barely sleep and I dread even the smallest of naps. I used to love driving and being in cars, now I can\u2019t even do those things.\nI\u2019m trying so hard.

I wanted to share what it looks like when journaling after a trauma related nightmare. Just having this on paper helped me understand what I have gone through!  In the last hour of sleep I was pulled unexpectedly deeply into a hole in my consciousness. I oozed down into a black, velvety void. I landed on a street lit by a cold fire. All around me pieces of shredded newspaper fell silently from the sky. The pieces of paper curled up and were burned away in individual flames, lit by an unseen force, before they touched the ground. I was on a paved street where only leaves and ash skittered like dancing shadows. I peeked around to see what looked like abandoned, Grecian buildings long empty of people. Farther along the avenue I saw what looked like many twisting, impossible staircases in the distance rotating around a glowing moon. I felt like something lurked around one of those staircase corners. There was *someone* hiding in the labyrinth. I crept closer to the Escher-like maze as a sense of foreboding washed over me. I whispered a name. I knew she was somewhere inside the twisting mass of shapes and I was morbidly curious to know her. *I got too close*. Suddenly the sky cracked like cheap plaster and 8 distinct voices chimed like bells around me and started to argue about whether, \u201cIt was time,\u201d or not. I felt my consciousness give way to someone else. I battled to front a single personality. I could feel the grooves of my mental state at their weakest places and knew suddenly that the sky was my extremely fragile sense of self. If someone hammered hard enough I would become the 8 arguing voices and give over to *her*. Another completely different sense of self. I would never be the same. I battled sleep, but it was like moving through frozen molasses. My eyes opened and dreams collided with reality. I saw a gollum-like face float over my partner\u2019s sleeping form in bed beside me and disappear with an evil grin. My eyes closed against my will as the body took over. I was being cast back into the black dark and this would be the last time I was one whole person if I lost my way down there. I could sense my reality release it\u2019s grasp as it cracked, snapped and groaned. It felt so freaking real.\n\n Panicked and gasping I closed my eyes. With all of my being I channeled a single thought. A boat floating on a calm lake that reflected the stars. \n\n I drifted on the row boat without a paddle. The night was clear and crisp and I could see the stars give way as a gentle pinkening dawn appeared on the horizon. Below me lurked a bleak maw hungry for me. Yet ahead I bore witness to a soft dawn. I adjusted my rudder, somehow found the will to envision a sheet of bold white canvas tethered to a pole, and sailed into the warmth of a new day."},{"id":"1606_ptsd","text":"Saw one of my abusers today Prayed very hard for God to take vengeance on her and her cohorts.\n\nI don't know what else to do.

People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on.

It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship.  Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read.  One is Codependent No More.  The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable.  You cannot change her and cannot change her mind.  Sometimes the best thing is to let go.  If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again.  It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving.  I suggest backing off and letting her go.

I 'completely shut down' and he had to really try to get any words out of me, apparently. the next morning i had false awakenings where i was just lying in bed being spooned, then his hand comes and grabs my mouth and shoves me into the bed. i woke up in a panic and realised he was just cuddling me so i must be dreaming, but other than that i absolutely can't distinguish what i dreamt from reality. I realise i've had the same thing before - dreams where 'arms', sometimes someones, sometimes invisible arms, grab my mouth and shove me into the bed.   \n\n\nI have PTSD but I don't actually know what the cause is. I can make a very good guess, but I just have symptoms and learning my triggers, with no actual solid memories. apparently once I told a friend what i thought happened while i was throwing up and crying and screaming (first ever flashback episode), but i don't have any memory of even doing that.   \n\n\nThere was an incident with an ex where I thought he tried to have sex with me in my sleep and when I asked him to stop he didn't.

Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger. You were betrayed by two people close to you.  That's a complex injury.  I don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life.  Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity. \u00a0I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again.  Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers.  If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while. \u00a0So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy.  Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like \"She doesn't regret the affair\" (you don't know that), \"She doesn't deserve happiness\" (that would be a harsh judgement), or \"She doesn't care that I'm hurt\" (again, there's no evidence of that).  Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. \u00a0When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself \"What evidence supports that thought as truth?\" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile. A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here.  It doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge.  Forgiveness is not about saying that something was \"okay\".  It's about saying \"It happened.  I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time\".  Forgiveness is putting it down.  She. . .  (trust me this is true). . . she carries her own burden of shame for what she did.  For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden.  It only adds to yours. \u00a0Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? You're hurt.  Validate that hurt.

I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to \"listen to her point of view because she had listened to me.\" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our \"conversation.\" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.\n\nAt some point in this \"conversation\" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say \"No\" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said \"nice talking to you guys.\" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.\n\nIn the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space\/not be all the way \"there\".  \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole \"me\" in ways I have never experienced before. In any case, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any support anyone might be able to offer."},{"id":"1626_ptsd","text":"a lot of repressed trauma and shame TW: sexual assault hello everyone. i made this throw away because this is something i rarely tell anyone but i need help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsome backstory:\n\nC is a very manipulative and terrible person.

C honestly never cared about any of us and just wanted our fully devoted attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm 21 now living in a different country and this happened to me when i was around 13\/14 yrs old. i was at a party with a friend and we and a couple others had a sleep over together afterwards. the next morning i awoke to my friend (let's call her C) lightly caressing my private part down below. i thought i just had morning wood and ignored it until i was certain it was actually C doing it. i didn't really know what to do i mean i was never taught about sex (due to our school system failing us) and it felt sort of good but also sort of weird. this went on for about 20 min. and then i held her hand and C put her hand down my pants and did things for a bit then abruptly stopped. C had a partner and C told me C felt like C cheated and i reassured C that it was ok and that we don't have to talk about it ever again and we can pretend it didn't happen and this relieved C.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthen a couple of years later i decide to end it with some of the people in the group, including C, because they're toxic. C then, after telling her this, tells me that I r\\*ped her that night and told everyone imaginable that i was some rapist monster. everyone shunned me and i was completely alone. C told their relatives and they wanted to talk so then i told my parents and it was the most embarassing thing to have to explain. we eventually moved away and i'm starting to find peace but being told i r\\*ped somebody when really i was the one who was sexually and mentally taken advantage of has given me severe PTSD (i've seen a therapist about this for about a year now) and also developed into a host of other problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe biggest problem i have is that i fear so much to go out in public. i fear that everyone knows and thinks i'm disgusting and ontop of all that i feel disgusting. my body was basically used and thrown away by C and even after C did this to me and told the school i was a r\\*pist, one of our mututal friends who still talked to me told me C said that i \"had a nice d\\*ck\" like what the fuck. i feel so much shame and  violated, uneasy, disgusting, etc. and i've felt like this for almost the majority of my life now because i had no way to cope with it or deal with it healthily until seeing a therapist recently. i feel so damaged and i blame myself honestly for even getting into that situation to begin with. i wish i could've gotten away but it seems like C will always loom over me and have power over me because C is a \"victim...\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif anyone has any helpful advice of how i can move past this please help. it's becoming unbearable to deal with. thank you and sorry for the long, drawn out story"},{"id":"1627_ptsd","text":"I need to talk about last night I've been volenteering as a firefighter even in the mists of COVID-19 outbreak .

Throwaway account. \n\nSo, this is a reallllyyyy long story, but about two years ago, I was in a relationship with a guy who I found out was lying to me and who I'm pretty certain was manipulating me. (Despite his mom and friend telling me he was manipulative and that I should stay away.) Anywho, he was very mentally ill and seeking counseling, but I think he should've gone to a residential treatment facility. Alas, he was in his twenties and no one could force him. \n\nAnyways, I have nightmares about seeing him now and I wake up feeling so panicked and anxious for a while. He would get into these extreme rages after fights with his mom, and he once told me he wanted to kill her. I was horrified, but he was acting very different than normal, so I talked him out of it. \n\nWe eventually went our separate ways and he lives very far away from me, but I still fear he will find me and hurt me, tho he never made any kind of threat against or was even mean to me. But I don't trust him at all. He also has a relationship with a new girl (she looks similar to me and his past girls in several ways, creepy) and honestly just the thought of it makes me sick. \n\nOh, and the story is worse, considering he went thru basically a psychotic break and for a couple of weeks I thought he would kill himself, but I won't get into it. \n\nI'm in a happy relationship now with a man that I trust very much and who is incredibly kind, so I know I am safe. I just hate that I still deal with these dreams and fears. I honestly don't want to talk to a counselor about it because it's not even a situation I like to talk about with close friends.

I need help understanding. &amp;#x200B;\n\n2 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD, for other reasons than what I am about to attempt to explain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 5 I visited Pakistan for a month, mainly because my uncle was getting married. I lot of eventful things happened, but for some reason, this one memory stands out and I can remember it more clearly than the rest. It was at his wedding, and being the only American child there, I felt alone and bored. So I went outside of the gates of my Uncle's house (Which was where the wedding was taking place) and I remember a man who was driving a wooden cart which was being pulled by goats. He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"new version\" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the \"original\" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a \"substitute\" memory in place of the other one?

Show this, do that, please him, don't fight back; all to here the sweet words from poisonous touches. To get attention from wolves in too clean sheeps clothes. I never knew when the price was too much till it was too late. \nToo late meaning, my 11 year old mind not seeing myself being groomed. My 12 year old hunger being denied to stay 98 lbs. My 13 year old body not understanding that being molested was wrong. My 14 year old body was now the product of a 45 year old man and the countless nights he snuck in my room. Then my 15 year old emotions only wanting it to stop but too afraid to end it. \nEnd it, was what I wanted but it won't stay in my past. End the tears when he leaves, they only come more. End the long nights of his encounters, but they come just as frequently just in a different form. End the pain in my body, the feeling of his breath on my neck, the feeling of hands over my mouth. The end... but it won't. \nIt won't since I've been told it was my fault. It won't since he will be seen as an amazing man, while he hides the fact he's a monster. It won't since he lives happy and my family has a new person to gossip about. So it won't. \nI don't think this will ever be fair or justified but it's the price I get to pay for wanting to be loved.

I was groomed as a child by a man who was 9 years older than me. I was 15 when it started. I continued a relationship with him for the next 4 years. When we moved in together he became increasingly abusive and he raped me. After that he started stalking me and harassing me endlessly, so I reported it. All of it. I didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t want to even think about it anymore. But I just wanted him to leave me alone.

Hi, my name is Liz and I'm a 30 year old woman with a lot of past trauma. Specifically, most of the trauma happened when I was a child living with parents who were abusive to one another and myself. I seem to be having flashbacks to things that have happened in my current relationship though. My partner likes to drink and I do not. I have no problem with anyone drinking around me, it's just that I don't find pleasure in it myself. He has acted in very scary and mean ways while drinking, and even though it has been over a year since he has done anything like this, I seem to be having issues. I lay in bed and sometimes have memories (that prior I didn't remember, or hadn't thought of in a long time) and they feel real. For example: he screamed in my face one time, and I had a memory of it the other night. I felt his voice causing my whole body to shake and rattle. I felt my life being possibly threatened. It took quite some time to shake the residual feelings and go to sleep. \n\nAfter experiencing the flashbacks, or experiencing something he has done, I tend to dissociate. At least I think it's dissociation. I actually welcome it and LIKE the feeling. I just kind of go away. I can't see what's in front of me or hear what people say. I go on autopilot or just stare into nothingness. It almost feels like maybe I'm going cross-eyed, lol. But no one has confirmed this for me. Although, as a child, my teachers would accuse me of \"daydreaming\" all the time. I would try to explain to my mom that I wasn't \"thinking\" of anything. I was just in a daze. She said, well whatever it is, just cut it out, lol. \n\nI like this feeling of being numb or calm and unaware. Is that unusual? Are these signs of PTSD? I really am not sure and just looking for some answers and possibly some people out there who are going through the same.  Most of the time I hear people describe dissociation as an unwanted or unpleasant thing. So, I'm a little confused as to why I welcome the sensation. (Most of the time, unless I'm trying to do something important)\n\nI really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. I hope you are doing well during these difficult times.

Diagnosed with PTSD 2 years ago. \n\nSo last night around 1am, I was in bed getting ready to sleep and I heard keys jangling outside my door, and I  just assumed it was my neighbours. I live in private student accommodation, so we have 24 hour security, I generally feel very safe. But then, after hearing these keys, my door began to open and a security guard walked in. I jumped out of bed to speak with him, apparently he'd had a noise complaint, my TV was on but it wasn't loud enough to be heard from where the complaint was, so he apologised for disturbing me and left. After he was gone I just broke down, it scared me so much\n\nThis morning I found out he filed a report himself because he's new to the job, and had thought that my flat was one with a communal living space, ie. A flat he would be allowed to enter without knocking. He had no idea he was walking into a studio flat, essentially my bedroom.\nI know that this guy made an honest mistake, I'm not upset about that. It just upset me so much to have someone walk into my space like that with no warning.

My experience of getting better. Brief mention of abuse without getting into details (also start and end are pointed out) This post was supposed to be a rant. \nI was feeling a bit gloomy after a flash-back, but as I kept writing I started to calm down. Hence the change in the tone.\n\nAlso, I wanted to point out that what I'm talking about is obviously just a small part of the process of getting back on your feet, but still it felt essential to me. Everyone's experience is different and this is just my personal perspective. \n\nSorry for my broken English, I hope this can be helpful to someone. \n\nI guess I have improved a lot in the last year. \nI really don't want to go back to the hole of despair I was trapped in, but sometimes I get scared I might let myself slip off into it again.\n\nTo prevent that, I make sure to bury any thoughts about my past very deep as soon as I sense them arise, of course some of them manage to sneak out and they get back at me in spades.\n\nI still get glimpses of moments I had successfully forgotten about. \nIt makes me feel like I'm still there, but it happens less and less frequently and every time it gets easier to snap back. \n\nUp until a year ago, I was leading a life that was split in half between the present and the past. \nThe present seemed to be so dull, as if I were half-asleep, while the past felt so much more real and threatening.\n\nI used to be so angry, I don't know how else to describe it other than it felt like fire was running through my veins. It was the only thing I felt and I couldn't help but cling to it, since it seemed to be my life's sole purpose and sustenance.\n \nI kept reliving the events of my trauma, going through them in my head over and over again. Each time getting angrier and angrier. \nI didn't mind it at all, I was actually glad for this blind rage. As if it fueled me. \n\n**START OF TRIGGER WARNING**\n\nI had spent so much time in captivity, fighting tooth and nails to survive, being tortured and raped every single day, not knowing if I would have managed to go on living, or if the time had come for me to be offed. \n\n**END OF TRIGGER WARNING**\n\nAfter I escaped, ordinary life was simply idle.\nHadn't it been for this anger, I would have just gone numb.\n\nAlthough comforting, I came to realize that I would have never been able to move forward without letting go of it all, the anger, the constant replay of gruesome scenes in my mind, the pointless questions that would never find any answers.\n\nThings were also getting out of hand, to the point where I involuntarily broke my friend's arm as I was startled by her giving me a hug unexpectedly. \nI was horrified at what I had done. \nI'm a petite girl but I've been fighting professionally for a long time and I couldn't bear the thought of harming someone whose only fault was getting caught between my messed up brain and me. \n\nIt's a hard process to forget about the abuse I had been through as a child and then again as an adult, but I'm managing and it does get easier. \nI had never thought it to be true, but time really does heal all wounds.\n\nBut most importantly it's the people you love. Keep them close. Even if you feel the need to cut everybody off and confine yourself in your pain, don't. Don't let this trauma induced sentiment prevail.\nIt's not what you or your loved ones need. \nThe ones we care about are the only thing that keeps us grounded to reality, to the present. \nYou can take small steps, there's no rush, you don't have to let everyone in on everything you are feeling unless you want to. Just try, as difficult as it is, to be open to their affection. \n\nBeing passionate about something is hard after you have survived trauma and readjusting to everyday life is particularly disorienting when you don't have a purpose, you just feel hollow. A good place to start is making it a point to be able to take care of the people you love. Having to be someone your dear ones can rely on, eventually makes you get back on track and you are going to become even stronger than you were before. \n\nIt's ironic how being a survivor makes you feel so dead inside, it might feel like you have lost all control over your own body and mind. \nBut please know this kind of feelings are only temporary. You have gone through a nightmare and made it out alive. You will overcome these feelings as well. \n \nYou won't have to look back at the person you were before in sorrow, you are growing to become someone you will learn to love. \nYou will have suffered greatly and still been able to pull yourself back up, you can accomplish anything you put your mind to. \n\nLife only gets better and better from here, it's tough but so are you."},{"id":"1674_ptsd","text":"How can you tell if you have PTSD vs anxiety\/depression?

We heard voices in the dark, angry scouse accents shouting \"pass me the blade\" and so on, and my friends began to run. I looked back to see 12 men run out of the dark yelling carrying knives and took off after my friends. When we came to the path of the second bridge one grabbed my friend who I had overtook and went to stab him him the back. I tackled the man and my friends got away, however I was then cornered into a grassy clearing and questioned on where I was from, told they were going to drag me to the dark and kill me, and I resisted their attempts to drag me. I was thrown back onto a construction fence, the only thing separating me from the water. Before I know it I was set upon, seeing strobe light like vision as my eyes were being punched repeatedly, my legs were brown from the dirt and being kicked relentlessly, and I was dodging and diving, swinging, trying to fend for myself, when I see one run up and plant a Stanley blade into my head, just above my eyebrow. It got stuck as the assault continued and part of my cheek was cut off with a much larger knife in an attempt to slice my eye out, they talked about finishing me and argued over who should have the knife and before I know it one charged aiming for my neck. I managed to grab his wrists and twist the hand but he put it through the skin in-between my thumb and index finger. I twisted his hand the whole way and felt a crack and he fell back causing his friends to look away. I dove to go over the barrier and was sliced down the entirety of my back and ran blacking in and out, pulled the knife out my head and collapsed in my own blood. When I awoke I walked myself to the hospital, got patched up, and tried to carry on. I was 17 at the time (now 18), and for a week or two I was fine. Then came the episodes. I would teleport back to that dockyard on repeat screaming and tangling my bedsheets, put my drink down in a bar and come around over a mile away as I'd just freaked out and ran and ran, with little to no memory of these episodes. I was and am a paranoid mess, and my gentle nature has become anxious and aggressive. I can't remember if I've clocked in at work, what I learn in classes, what I ate for breakfast, and when I did go on medication was so drowsy and whacked out my mind I couldn't learn either way. I fell asleep in work, classes, I stopped taking them. I now am back to essentially square one, and have already savaged one of my attackers when I seen him in broad daylight.

I had prayed and prayed to a god I don't believe in that my grandmother would take him away from the same room and whoop his ass and cuff him but it was never spoken of... I don't even remember how old I was, my school counselor narrowed my trauma to starting age five. I guess she had talked to my mom over the phone about the apartment I described to her. Middle school was the last time anyone spoke of those things.\n\nI am not the best at typing on this broken phone. I thought that typing here would somehow help me if I got my story, well a fraction of it, out there into the atmosphere.. this is only a snippet of the horrors I lived through while around my brother. My dad to this day tries to win him over and loves him so much and my mother has him under her wing at all times. No one talks about that shit. Everyone loves him so much while I sit here sleepless half the time over the torture I've lived. He probably sleeps soundly every night of his disgusting life.

TW: Loss of friendship, depression, anxiety, low key suicidal, emotionally broken, sexual discomfort Trigger warning: \nLoss of friendship, depression, anxiety, low key suicidal, emotionally broken, sexual discomfort\n\nI don't know if the stuff I'm about to write is actually triggering, but I'd rather post a warning too many than too few. \nThere is no violence or physical\/real life confrontation in the post to come. It took place via chat. \n\nHey all. First time here - let me start by saying thank you for having this community. \nI am sorry my first post is gonna be jumping right in and asking for help, but I have nowhere else to turn. \nMy friends can only do so much and my therapy sessions are cancelled for at least 2 weeks as my entire country is on lockdown of all non-essential things. \n\n\nSo, here goes. \n3 days ago was a day as days normally are. Get up, eat some, whatever else. \nHowever, completely out of the blue I get a message from a guy I considered my best real life friend. A guy I have had movie weekends with, making costumes, crafting jewellery, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a lot of hugging and a ton of common interests. \nI'm not exaggerating when I'm saying this guy might be the best part about my daily life in real life(except for the hobbies that keep me busy and alive). \nIn the message, less than 2 weeks after we hung out, laughed, talked and hugged, he wrote to me that he realized it was gonna seem like thunder from a clear sky, but he didn't feel comfortable around me anymore and because he was unable to tell me when something was crossing a boundary of his he had to end our friendship effective immediately. \nThe behaviour he was triggered by was what I considered normal jokes. Normal jokes with awcual undertones, pretty normal stuff. But what I didn't know was that he has a traumatic past that made such jokes incredibly uncomfortable to him and he never told me I was crossing his boundaries so I did not see it coming a mile away, especially since he and I had been together and had fun shortly before then. \n\nI cried for several hours, just looking at my computer at nothing, crying and wiping my face. When I was done crying I started imagining what I was gonna do now. And the thought of suicide entered my mind and presented itself as a logical option to solve all my problems. I don't think I'm gonna make an attempt, in my 30 years I haven't ever, but the fact that the thought entered my mind and seemed like a reasonable option scared me. \n\nI made it through the day. And I slept. But things didn't get better. \nSince then I've been unable to find the motivation to live. I am a hobby artist and usually I am so passionate and active that I forget to go to bed and sometimes remember that I haven't showered for 2 days. Gross, I know, but that should say something about the magnitude of my obsession with my hobbies. \nFor the last 3 days I have done none of it. I have been immersing myself in a large computer game to disconnect from reality. I have a constant sadness and it feels like my entire body is slugging through a hot, dry environment but without being dry. My chest feels like it's being compressed. Whenever I stop and let my mind rest my pulse starts racing and I feel an overwhelming anxiety. \nAnd since then I have hated myself and my own sexuality to the point where just thinking about sexual desires or activity will make me nauseated, guilty, sad, angry and deeply uncomfortable. \n\nHow do you all deal with being traumatized like this? I was already fragile, but I was making real progress. Now it feels like I've been dragged 5 years back, like being pulled backwards into a vat of icy water, struggling to get back up. \nI don't remember the last time I felt this broken. I feel like I've lost everything. And I have no idea what to do. \n\nThank you for reading this.

He withdraws and does not want to talk about anything, responding with short snippets. He pushes me away, believing he is a burden and will only drag me down.

I know it's long winded so I understand if people don't manage to get through it. Today was the first time I put this in words and finally explained it to my wife and now I don't know where to go from here.\n\nSo, I'm currently in therapy for PTSD as well as other things. Over the last year I've worked through DBT skills group to help me learn new coping skills in preparation for PE. But now that I've completed group and it's time to start PE my therapist thinks I'm not ready. She doesn't think that I've stopped blaming myself and that PE right now will only make things worse for me. I don't know what to do with that information because I don't know how to stop blaming myself.\n\nA little background, I'll put as much as my brain will let me. Seven years ago my only child passed away. His death was in part due to hospital error. I know you're probably thinking \"That sounds like the hospital's fault not yours.\" but hear me out. There was a sequence of events that lead to his death, and in this sequence of events there were times I could have done something and didn't. I made several conscious decisions as things unfolded. I saw with my own eyes that the hospital wasn't following protocol. I knew this because they had already explained the protocol and we had to sign releases giving them permission explicitly for this particular treatment. I knew this. But when I saw them breaking that protocol I was too damned scared to say anything. I was too much of a coward to face my fear of confronting the staff to say anything and I __chose__ to stay quiet. Later, I had a second opportunity to speak up and I again chose not to. Then, when things had progressed too far, they believed his heart was beginning to fail and asked us if they should resuscitate, but that it might not do any good. My wife was too scared to answer so __I made the decision to let him go__. I made the decision to let my own child die.\n\nI feel like the hospital metaphorically put a loaded gun to my child's head and I saw it happening and did absolutely nothing to stop it. I may not have pulled the trigger but I saw what was happening and my own cowardice stopped me from doing anything.\n\nHow do I not blame myself for this? How do I let go of feeling like I played a part in this when I made actual conscious decisions that lead up to my own child's death? I'm being told that PE is my best hope and chance of getting better but that I can't do it until I'm ready to stop blaming myself. But I have no fucking clue how to do that.

You, what can I say to you. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry this is happening to you. I\u2019m so sorry if you\u2019re happy, and I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re excited for the future. I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re so comfortable with who you share your life with, I\u2019m sorry I allowed that. I\u2019ve been carrying guilt for years that I granted him the freedom to do this to another individual, and that I was so scared to open up about what occurred four years ago. \n\nYou\u2019re going to find out soon, and you\u2019re not going to believe it at first. You\u2019re going to be told bluntly, and you will reject it. Perhaps you\u2019ve already been told, by his friends that are no longer his friends for a reason that you should know by now. I couldn\u2019t comprehend it either, not at first. I didn\u2019t understand what information I had just been handed, what it meant and what it was doing to me. Four years later I am still processing what it was and who he is. It still weighs on me as heavy as it did that night, but in a different way.\n\nI mourned my relationship first, I had succumbed to what I thought was love, but was ultimately masterful manipulation. He made it easy to attach myself to him with promises of an appealing future. He had a way of convincing me he was smarter than me, and everyone else. You\u2019ll be okay if you stick with me, the rest of the world is toxic and confused. We\u2019re okay if we just stay here. I love you because you\u2019re practical, you\u2019re not like any other girl I\u2019ve dated. They\u2019re all crazy, you\u2019re sane. You\u2019re grounded, and you pay half of the rent. \n\nHe was secretive to start, a few early discrepancies regarding other girls online. Inexperienced me deemed this normal, we could moved passed all of that noise - what counted was where we ended up each night. He kept nude images of these girls on his phone, we were not off to a great start. But I was practical, I was different, and I made him feel smart. I existed to embellish him, an important role - and he knew it. I was his type; insecure and accustomed to abuse. This particular trauma, however, is not abuse. Though there was plenty, emotional and physical abuse. I was slapped in the face at a party in front of friends, maliciously choked, kicked off of a bed and a couch - he took a towel once and shoved my head back with it. He shoved me into a wall when I announced his lack of masculinity too loudly. \n\nHe worked in security at a ballet school, often overnight. Based on the mistrust that was instilled in me early on in our relationship, the overnight work worried me. Is he talking to girls? Is he sending them unsolicited dick pics? Probably. By this point he had convinced me it was in my head, and I was massively paranoid. I was turning into one of the girls he didn\u2019t want to be around, someone insane and impractical. But I paid rent, and contributed towards the idea of a future. I was being molded into someone who would love him no matter what doubts I had. \n\nHe had some performance issues come up at his job. I can\u2019t remember what they were regarding, or if they were even real\u2026But he lost his full time position. He maintained employment with the same company at a different location, part-time. We got by with savings and my serving job. I got a call one day from his manager, Patrick. They had originally tried to call him, and I was listed as his emergency contact. It was not the first time I had received a call from his work, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I was at work when he called so he left a voicemail - I listened to it on my way home from work. He spoke as if he were talking to him, instructing him to call him back - and that they had to cut into all of the lockers at his previous workplace. He listed off a few of the items found in the lockers and wanted to be sure that they were his, and make sure everything was accounted for. There was a laptop, and a safe box. \n\nI asked him about these items but he assured me they weren\u2019t his. I let it go, as I had many things during our time together. He was picking up a few evening shifts where he could at this time, quite sporadically. He would leave around 2 or 4, and return around 10pm. I got cut from work when the dinner shift showed up, around 4:30. I left work, walked south on Bay Street, east on College, and hopped on the northbound train. I got home around 5:15pm. I unloaded, changed into sweats, the usual. Cleaning was pretty relaxing after a day in the service industry, so I went to grab some supplies under the kitchen sink cupboard. Our kitchen counters were L shaped, and I always thought it was weird that where the space under the cupboard should have ended, it extended passed where the wall above sat. This particular evening I noticed that this was not the case, and somehow the wall had moved forward. I was frightened, I was one of those people that ready creepy stories at night - you know the one where people discover there are people living in small spaces in their home. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the wall, it was a piece of bristol board. It was relieving for a brief moment - but that relief was short lived. I removed that board and discovered a safe and a laptop. Since that moment I\u2019ve really repressed what I found - through denial or embarrassment, I\u2019ve somehow forgotten in detail what it was I had seen. I still don\u2019t know what journey I set out to after that moment, but it wasn\u2019t to deal with seeing those images. That was my second mistake. My first was my initial thought - the end of my four year relationship. Logic was not present, logic would have been to immediately call the police - instead of waiting for him to come home to confront him about it.* \n\nIf he somehow sees this - he will frantically come up with something to tell you to convince you I am just some crazy ex-girlfriend out to get me for breaking up with me. Or perhaps he has already set something in place to manipulate you into believing that none of this is truth, and anything anyone ever says apart from him is a lie. When I left Toronto, he covered his tracks - and somehow convinced his family and our mutual friends that I was not to be trusted. He was fine, and merely unhappy in our relationship. He never got the help he claimed to seek, he paused his search for child pornography, but not for long. It\u2019s never for very long. Damaged people don\u2019t get better without proper treatment. \n\nI think about this every fucking day. It\u2019s with me, for better or for worse. I think about the children who attended and lived at the ballet school that he worked at - it\u2019s such a privilege for them to be there, a dream. I think about the children that were trafficked and exploited - contributing to his sick obsession. I think about the women who are trafficked in Southern Ontario. I think about his other ex-girlfriend who also knew about this. I think about his family who are under his false influence.

And it can take a toll on our personal wellbeing. \nMy daughter went out to the bar with her friends Saturday. First time without mama there. But, her best friend's dad works in the kitchen. Big tough (but sweet) guy everyone knows and respects. Her other friend's dad was there watching out for her.

My nervous mommy-heart tried to rest assured, she was safe. And, she was.\nBut. A 20 year old kid, not a local, was here for labor day. He was staying in a summer cottage by the lake. There are 2 bars on my road. He, with the big holiday crowd, managed to slip into the bars, looking for a girl. He came up to the kids' table, chatted and asked if they'd seen her. He left on foot. Mag and her friends left the bar after 3. That kid was dead within the hour, found unresponsive on the road near the last bar. They had JUST talked to him!! It was initially believed he was the victim of a drunken driver, hit and run. But now, there are more questions. Cause of death is pending autopsy. The kids are devastated. My town is upside down. Her friend worked there that night in the kitchen &amp; joined them after. She worked last night as well, came here in tears, just heart torn. My babies are hurting and I can't bear it! And the world feels that much more dangerous. So difficult to ever feel the same. She was safe..\nAnd..where one of my best friends lives, a 2 year old was hit by a car and killed.

I feel pretty good most of the time, but still have triggers. I feel like my relationship with my boyfriend is strained at times because of my triggers\/responses even though I\u2019ve tried to explain it to him. \n\nFor example, he sometimes reaches out and touches me while he\u2019s talking (like when he\u2019s making a point). Last week, I shrunk back from his touch and he looked at me like I was the Antichrist. I told him that I don\u2019t like to be poked or touched unexpectedly, but he still didn\u2019t seem to understand. This has nothing to do with him and it\u2019s a reflexive response for me. \n\nOne major trigger for me is violence, screaming etc. in movies...especially in the evening or near bed time because I have nightmares. I\u2019ve left the room before and gone to watch TV in the bedroom when he and my daughter were watching a scary movie and there was no issue. I\u2019ve told him many times that movies can be triggering for me. Last night, a movie came on where a woman was getting ready for a bed and a man in a mask was lurking outside. The music got ominous and I knew I had to get out of there FAST. I quickly went to the other room and turned the TV on to drown it out. I could feel my heart racing and my breath quickening just imagining what was happening on that TV in the other room. If he wanted to watch that movie, I was ok with it, I just couldn\u2019t be in that room. He came in and told me we needed to have a conversation about communication and how those situations could be better handled in the future. I told him that I left the room quickly because I knew something was coming and didn\u2019t want to see\/hear it since it was close to bed time. I said it had nothing to do with him and I wasn\u2019t angry or anything. He continued to try to have a conversation about communication with me in that moment. I resented it. I feel like I did what I needed to in that moment to feel safe, and because it made him slightly uncomfortable, he was forcing me into a conversation I didn\u2019t want to have. He implied that I wasn\u2019t an adult.\n\nI have been suicidal at a number of points in my life, am an alcoholic and have done a lot of shitty things over the years to deal with my trauma.

He had a gun, started taking my clothes off  and I just couldn't move, it's like I was not even there in control of my body. I just kept thinking he would kill me after he finished what he wanted.\nHe eventually let me go and I called the police as soon as I ran out of sight. They arrested him.\nWhat followed was a series of exams, questions by the police, having to identify him, working with a lawyer, going to court and many things that make me understand why so many victims don't even report their abuse to the police. To be fair, they were extremely professional and did their best to not make things worse. \nI've had to take a lot of medication to prevent STDs and they made me throw up twice a day for 6 months. At one point I'd feel sick just by looking at the pills.\nMy family and I have been through so much because of that, it was also right after my grandfather committed suicide (he was schizophrenic). \nI couldn't stay home anymore, we had to move to my grandpa's apartment for a few months so I could breathe.\n\nI kept going to school and trying my best to not let that control my life, and I think on the outside it looked like I was ok, but I just felt like a ghost.

It's making me depressed, affecting my relationships, my sex life and daily life.\nI'm living far from my family, and I don't wanna tell them what's going on because they will just feel upset and powerless.\nI try to forgive myself for not doing anything like running or kicking him, or just paying more attention because I didn't even see him approach me.. \nI guess now I'm just having a mix of emotions, I don't wanna live in the past but I'm not feeling connected to the present no matter how hard I try.\n\nI feel very lonely because the people who love me can't really understand my feelings and I know they hurt too, but in a different way. I feel helpless.\nI'm not even sure this is just PTSD or something else, if there is anything I can or should do... \n\nThank you for reading. Any advice, comfort words or even just a \"I understand\" is welcome."},{"id":"1745_counseling","text":"I have been dating a guy for two years. I think I love him, but I don't know any more.

Night terrors, sleep paralysis, those come in waves but I've learned to cope with them pretty well-to an extent. I wanted to address another strange thing that's happening with me.\n\n\nFirst of all, I ALWAYS dream. Doesnt matter If I nod off for 5 minutes or sleep 12 hours, I'm constantly dreaming and vividly remember everything. (Can be terrible sometimes) but normally it's pretty ok to deal with...a lot of my dreams just really mess with my head and leave me emotional a lot of the time. It can be mentally draining.\n\n\nI also have been experiencing \"reawakening\" dreams in which I feel myself wake up several times in my dream, believe I'm awake in the dream, although my surroundings are unusual, i somehow brush it off and continue with my day until something starts to tip me off that I'm dreaming and i begin to start the process of waking up again, sometimes just right into another dream. \n\n\nI could go on and on, but really I was wondering if anyone else with past trauma has dealt with dreaming situations like this?"},{"id":"1747_counseling","text":"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time.

One person working hard in a relationship can make things better for a while., but in the long haul you need two people giving some effort. I'm reading between your lines here and I wonder if your need to keep the family together is getting you to apologize when you've done nothing wrong and ignore things you've felt hurt by. I sense that you're doing all the work...that it's not balanced.\u00a0I have worked with many couples and I've learned never to underestimate what kind of change is possible; anything is possible. But in order for change in a couple to occur, you need two people who are both willing to own their choices and behaviours, and who have empathy. Your boyfriend doesn't appear to have these components; he pushes you away and blames you when he's done something hurtful.Can you be honest with yourself about what's happening? I encourage you to sit down with a trusted friend or therapist and look at what you have here and what your options are.

You control the direction of sessions and depending on how you're feeling in a particular day can predict what direction that session takes.

Super fucking anxious and the weirdest ambivert. I avoided eye contact and got spooked easily and idk man people just make me nervous and it gets even worse in social settings. I\u2019ve been on SSRIs for years and have seen multiple therapists and have honestly just been dealing with the highs and lows of mental illness.

As soon as he opened the door, jokingly said \u2018Hmm it smells like gas. Best walk briskly so we don\u2019t get blown up!\u2019 I saw the construction workers across the street crowded around where I occasionally park when running late.

I turned around to see what was going on.. the amount of fire and smoke and debris everywhere and people screaming was unreal. Meanwhile we had coolers full of tissue from our experiment, glass in our eyes and didn\u2019t know what else was going to happen. After made it down the block and around the corner to our office building we were just screaming \u2018WHAT THE FUCK\u2019 at each other out of shock.\n\nPeople starting to come outside the building to see what has happened.. as my boss was dealing with everyone outside, I ran up the stairs to grab saline from my desk on the other side of the building to rinse the glass out of my eyes. All of the employees in the building were trying to go see what happened as I was running by them repeating \u2018don\u2019t go outside there was a natural gas explosion.\u2019 I remember the confused look on their faces..\n\nIt\u2019s so fucking hard processing it all. Normally I\u2019m by myself in the vivarium, and walking those two blocks between my 2 buildings is a normal, daily routine for me.

I\u2019m so fucking lucky to be physically okay for the most part. I have minor damage to my ears, but mentally I am a wreck.. \n\nBegging our colleagues not to call an ambulance to take us to the ER.. waiting in the car while our coworker navigates the streets as they\u2019re being blocked off by police, black smoke filling the sky, power-walking through the hospital to get to occupational health to get medical attention.. it\u2019s all so vivid. I remembered seeing people in the coffee shop I walked past every day.. I broke down...\n\nIt\u2019s only been 4 days, but it feels like it\u2019s been an eternity. I didn\u2019t sleep the first night. I can barely eat. My body is so weak and sore, it takes so much energy just to put one foot in front of the other. Taking life hour by hour, minute by minute because I now have triggers, and since this is all so new it\u2019s fucking terrifying and sad when it happens...\n\nI do have a good support system. My lab and my PI have been incredible during this, including my direct supervisor that I was with when this happened. I live with my boyfriend and our dogs, and his family is close. My family has been doing the best they can although they are a few states away. The occupational health team and particularly the psychologist have been so helpful. \n\n\nBut at the end of the day no one knows what it was like. To be so close to death, and come out somewhat unscathed? To have such a strange series of coincidences happen? It\u2019s all so surreal and yes I\u2019m extremely thankful to be alive, but the survivors guilt immediately crept in. I\u2019m a trained BLS instructor, and I just ran.. I understand there was nothing I could do to save anyone, but I still feel so much guilt and shame.. \n\nI just needed to get it all out. Advice on moving forward is welcome\/appreciated. \n\n\nRIP Mr. Lee, and condolences to the Kaffeinate family.\n\n[Brightleaf Explosion - Durham, NC](https:\/\/www.wral.com\/crews-maneuvering-through-durham-explosion-debris-after-61-year-old-coffee-shop-owner-killed-and-firefighter-duke-employees-inju\/18317583\/)"},{"id":"1777_ptsd","text":"4 Years - Pain Indescribable - TW: Preg loss, clinical death survival I\u2019ve been living with PTSD, MDD for 4 years now.

I\u2019m at a loss. Some background information. He (32 m) and I (31 f) have been together almost 18 years now. We moved to our current location after I accepted a job position about two years ago, and he had his little brother move down about four months after that. We all got really close. Flash forward to October 2018.\n\nHe and his brother work out of town, on the morning of the incident his little brother was killed right in front of him for absolutely no reason, seriously, no reason. He blames himself, has been in and out of rehab centers (he uses illicit drugs, and most recently, alcohol) to numb himself and avoid reality. Our family lives about 14 hours from us, so really it\u2019s just him and me. \n\nPlease understand I am not trying to portray myself as a victim. I just honestly don\u2019t know what to do. He doesn\u2019t want to face what happened and work through the trauma, he just tries numbing it. Everything gets taken out on me. I listen, boy do I listen, to every detail of what happened that morning. I understand it is good for him to get it out, but I am not a licensed therapist. He refuses to see a professional. Lately, his drinking has increased so much he drinks straight liquor like it\u2019s water and I become his verbal punching bag. He blacks out every night not remembering what he said\/did. It\u2019s getting to be a lot. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t him, that it\u2019s his PTSD. I don\u2019t want this to be the end of our relationship, but in all honesty, I\u2019m at such a loss. It\u2019s a lot on my shoulders to take care of everything that isn\u2019t related to him and his PTSD and then adding that on top of my regular responsibilities. I have no support from his family, it\u2019s kind of like an out of sight out of mind ordeal. \n\nHonestly, at this point, I\u2019m just looking for some help or guidance. Like I said, I don\u2019t want the relationship to end, and his brother wouldn\u2019t want his death to result in the either. But there is only so much I can do to help him without him getting the actual help he needs, professional help. What am I doing wrong? Are there things I could be doing different? Is it selfish to want to put \u201cme\u201d first in my own life?\n\nSorry for the rambling.

There exists only four years of my 30 year life not touched by trauma. \n\nA list of only some of the things I experienced, feel free to just skip through to some you may experience.\n\nExtreme stomach pain - up until my early teens I would wake in the middle of the night a few times a month with pain so bad I couldn\u2019t stand, it felt like I had a giant stone in my stomach and it needed out. I hid this from my parents.\n\n\nFainting - I started fainting when I was in my early teen years and through middle and high school. You know when you stand up too fast sometimes and get dizzy, it was exactly like that except next thing I know I\u2019m on the floor, waking and disoriented. I hid this from my parents until it happened when I stood up in the tub and fell out into the floor and banged my head on the wall.  I underwent some tests at children\u2019s hospital and they came up with Chronic Dehydration (Diagnosis #1)\n\n\nInsomnia and Fatigue - I used to sleep and wake up without moving all night. I could get out of bed and just pull my covers over a bit and my bed was made. Fast forward to about 19 years old and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stay awake for an entire day but also couldn\u2019t stay asleep at night. When I did sleep, I tossed and turned, when I wake my covers are everywhere. I haven\u2019t slept more than a couple hours at a time in over 10 years. \n\n\nVivid dreams - I remember most of my dreams. Sometimes I will forget what is real and what was in a dream because they feel so normal. However, I also have dreams that maybe some would consider bad. I have found them entertaining because I dream somewhat lucidly. If something really bad is happening I can think to myself that it\u2019s only a dream and see it through. My dreams are like heavy action movies\/games but sometimes I do have some reminiscent of my experience and those do mess me up for a day or so. \n\n\nSocial Anxiety - Around 20 years old I went to the doctor because I was developing a fear of being in social\/public settings while alone or accompanied. I developed a fear of the phone years before as well. I would suddenly forget words when having conversations, among other weird things causing awkwardness. It was just easier not to socialize. My PCP, unaware of my trauma diagnosed me with Social Anxiety. (Diagnosis # 2)\n\n\nHeart Arrhythmia - I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 23. They put me under and when I awoke they told me to make an appointment with my doctor and to give them a slip of paper from the heart monitor. I had my appointment and had an EKG where my heart off every third beat. They scheduled me with a cardiologist and they did a sonogram measuring my heart and getting a better look at everything and confirmed my left ventricle was beating before it was full every third beat. This would explain why I was fainting ... I wasn\u2019t getting enough blood to my brain when standing too fast at just the right beat. I was diagnosed with chronic PVCs. (Diagnosis #3)\n\n\nDepression - This one was tricky. I just never felt anything except void so I never knew it wasn\u2019t normal. I never really felt joy but I never really felt sad. I always thought about just not living. I thought about suicide all the time. My mind would wander there a lot but it felt commonplace. I never felt like I was so sad I needed to die. I just felt like, life was a lot of work to feel like I\u2019m always struggling to catch up. Plus I had a tough time forming any sort of friendship or attachments which I know is important. But that didn\u2019t make me sad or upset, it\u2019s not like I wanted those things because I don\u2019t know any better. I do see other woman with a bunch of girlfriends and sometimes I feel like I wish I had that but also I immediately think about how exhausting it would be. I guess the best way I can describe myself is numb. My dad took his life when I was 24. I felt nothing, everyone else was breaking down and all I thought about was getting a week off work. I wasn\u2019t close to my dad but wasn\u2019t distant either. He would always tease me about being his only non-affectionate child and about my half hugs, he would give me full dad hugs which I secretly was okay with. He never hurt me. It does make me upset that my relationship with my dad suffered because of the trauma he never knew about. Anyway I contemplated suicide in such a way that I knew exactly how and when. I also knew it wasn\u2019t right and called my doctor and told her something needs to change. She put me in touch with a therapist and I was diagnosed with depression. I saw her a couple times and was over it and didn\u2019t go back. I never told her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #4)\n\n\nIrregular menses - I went to my Gyno with a request for an IUD because I could remember to take the pill daily like I used to in the past. She did routine blood work to make sure I was a good candidate and found that my DHEA levels were 3 times the acceptable range. DHEA is an androgen released by the adrenal glands. I\u2019m a woman and do not need that much testosterone. Later I would find out that DHEA is released after a fight\/flight\/freeze response to lower the cortisol levels back to normal. I was diagnosed with PCOS, I do not look like I have PCOS but it is normal for women with PCOS to have elevated DHEA. I did not tell her about my trauma. (Diagnosis #5)\n\n\nConcentration problems - I started college when I was 28. I noticed I was having a lot of problems concentrating. My therapists had mentioned in the past that she wanted to test me for ADHD. My PCP put me in touch with a psychologist and after a couple hours of testing, confirmed and diagnosed me with ADHD. His report also diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder but he did not believe I was depressed but could benefit from CBT. I did not tell him about my trauma. (Diagnosis 6 &amp; 7) \n\n\nA few other things I experienced but I don\u2019t feel like going into:\nEating disorders\nAlcohol and drug abuse \nPromiscuity \n\n\nAll of these things! I felt crazy. I was on 5 medications and I still felt like something was wrong. Fast forward to this year.... I share my trauma with a therapist at the local rape crisis center and I learn that all of those things, every single one of them can be attributed to PTSD. It has been such a relief to feel like I\u2019m not crazy. That I am experiencing a completely normal. A normal response to trauma. Thank you for reading and letting me get this off my chest. \n\n\nJust now I have felt something new. I feel thankful that my body and my brain have tried so hard to keep me safe all these years.

Were there any kinds of resources you had to back yourself up? \n\nI\u2019m not saying this is the be all, end all of my mental issues, it\u2019s just something overall that has made the most sense that encompasses all the problems I seem to face.

(I have a separate Facebook I just opened 7mo ago for family only and have been fine with that).\n\nSo with getting back on this old account, I was reading comments like \"if there is anything I can do to help\", so I thought I would give it a try... while trying to ignore the post from the woman who had an affair with my husband calling me a \"dear friend\" while I was in a coma and could not lose my ever loving mind on her.\n\nYou can guess where this is going... I am back to being ANGRY, HURT, BETRAYED , and a very unhealthy dose of self hatred \/loathing constantly. These are people who knew what was going on, the pain I was in and still in and are seriously responding with things like \"glad things are going good for you\".\n\nI am accustomed to not being heard when I speak, cry or beg for mercy... why was I such a fool to tell these people I am still suffering? Why did I try for help? Why did I think they cared? Is my brain so muddled that I convinced myself I mattered to these people? \n\nAnd last but not least... why do people honestly wonder why I don't leave the house or interact with people IRL?\n\nTLDR.. I was a fool and thought revisiting an old Facebook looking for help, only to be reminded why I had tried to end my life."},{"id":"1811_counseling","text":"I'm a teenager.

There is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences, where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help.  That said, clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover, or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future. . . what they are able to pay for out of pocket.  That first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture, but it doesn't have to stay that way.  Counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients, and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way.  The counselor you select should be compassionate, caring, able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns, and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth. Once you have found a counselor you want to work with, you would then schedule an appointment to meet.  That first session is often very low key.  There might be some forms for you to complete, which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you.  The counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement.  This document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor's credentials; practice rules; forms of payment; office hours; emergency contact details; and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law, among other details.  All of this benefits you as the client, so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor. In the first session, it is absolutely okay to be nervous.  Here's a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): Counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client, as the client is to meet their new counselor.  It's true.  We as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills.  While simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too, and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us."},{"id":"1836_counseling","text":"What makes my step child, an 8 year old boy, choke my daughter, a 6 year old girl?

I had shoved my childhood abuse in a closet to never look at it again.\n\nBut after months of sleep deprivation, fixating on having to be the perfect mom and excessive paranoid thoughts of my beautiful child dying or being kidnapped I was coming undone at the seems.\n\nMy husband pushes me to go to therapy and I learned that my erratic moods, my paranoia, my insomnia... just every little thing that made my life hard was real. It wasn't just me defective, born wrong. I knew I could do something to improve my life and my daughters.\n\nHowever anger is a huge problem for me and one time when my daughter was about 1.5 years old, she was being a kid. An I just lost it, I screamed at her at the top of my lungs and slammed the kitchen cupboard so hard it broke off its hinges. The second I turned around and saw my daughters scared face I broke down.\n\nI asked myself how I could do this? What kind of mother scares her child? I held her close and I promised myself I would die before I ever let my anger scare my child again. But its not so easy, the anger comes faster than I even have time to process whats happening and it bursts out of me. When I was young I used breaking this as a way to vent it, but I can't any longer go around destroying crap, especially not in front of a 2 year old.\n\nMy solution now? Lay down on the floor. Literally as fast as I can, lay down flat on the floor, face down and take a few deep breaths. Tell myself \"you're mental illness isnt who you are\" over and over again. When my daughter stops throwing a fit, or doing whatever it is that has dried up my patience levels and sees me, I pop up and go \"peek a boo\". She then laughs and goes \"again!\"\n\nThe point is... My biggest fear is my mental health causing my child to be scarred, to have a broken childhood. It feels so good to take a moment I am not emotionally in control and turn it into something she sees as so innocent. She's too young to know that mom isn't perfect.

I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes.  However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust.  My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again.  During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with.  But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child. \n   The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her.  He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away).  He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too.  He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since.  Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can\u2019t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual.

He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything.  He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time.  He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him.  He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life. \n   I'm of course hurt and in shock.

Because I had the symptoms since I can think.)\n\nSo first I really thought: wow, now I know why I'm such a fuck up and now I can do the real therapy and be normal for once normal.\n\nBoy, I was wrong. The time in the clinic were the worst. The clinic is specifically for PTSD sufferers. And yeah, I like to talk,and I talked to many people. Most people didn't say anything about their trauma and what they suffer from and I think that's the right thing to do in such a setting, I think it was even the rule. But you know how it is, some people told me the worst you can imagine. Told me what happened to them. How they suffer. How they hallucinate. Basically told me their life is an ongoing terror. All I was answering was like: oh I'm so sorry. I didn't have it so bad.\n\n(Before I went to this clinic I was in a general hospital, there they told me to NEVER talk about my trauma until I'm in the PTSD clinic.)\n\nWhen I finally had my trauma therapy session. I told her everything but I didn't feel it. It was like I don't care. I apologized and said I am wrong here.\n\nI still am sure I do not have PTSD.

First things first, I in no way intend to be disrespectful, or undermine the experiences of anyone with this post. I am really scared to post this because I\u2019m preempting negative or hostile responses regardless of how supportive and nice this community seems, so please be considerate if you intend to comment. Also, I probably won\u2019t look at the comments for a long time as a way to reduce the fear I\u2019ll feel when reading them. So keep that in mind if you\u2019re expecting a reply from me. \n\nI experience social anxiety a lot. And quite severely too. Even with medication and regular therapy it still affects my daily life to a great extent. \n\nFor those of you not familiar, social anxiety disorder could be summarised as an intense, usually irrational fear of being judged by others. Yes, of course it makes oral presentations a NIGHTMARE, but it also affects how loud I play music when home alone, in the fear that neighbours will judge my (un-noteworthy) music taste. Or what brands I buy, in fear of the cashier judging me. Or what pictures I set as my lock screen in case someone else sees it. Basically, it\u2019s a very irrational fear that I\u2019m very aware of. Regardless, I have little control over it as it is essentially instinctual, as y\u2019all probably understand. \n\nEvery now and then something will happen in my life that causes me great stress. A mundane event that becomes worse when combined with my SAD. Usually this is some form of criticism. The symptoms I\u2019ve found most prominent are the main symptoms of PTSD; increased anxiety\/aggression, reliving the event when triggered, avoidance of things I once enjoyed because of the event, things somewhat related to the event triggering anxiety and stress, dreams and nightmares surrounding the event etc. I\u2019ll provide a few examples of these affecting me below. Not all of my symptoms, because I\u2019m writing on mobile and some of them are self explanatory. \n\nFor example, I used to do low level volleyball. The training sessions were really difficult for me as, being a beginner, I feared how my team perceived my ability. It continued like this, and was particularly bad during one session. I can\u2019t remember what happened, which is pretty standard for my stressful memories, but I know it didn\u2019t appear severe otherwise others on my team would also remember. For weeks after, the topic of volleyball caused great stress to me. \n\nThe thought of practicing or going to games caused panic attacks. When I thought of the event my core would seize up, heart rate would increase, limbs would start trembling, and sometimes my breathing would speed up or become sporadic. A bit like a mini panic attack, without all the symptoms or duration (these episodes lasted a few seconds, 10 at the most).  \n\nI would avoid the topic of volleyball for weeks after, even stopping reading a book series that mentioned volleyball because it reminded me too much of the event. I would lose interest in volleyball, despite me actually really enjoying it. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few years, but thinking of this instance still causes some of these symptoms, to a lesser degree. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had nightmares about this specific situation, but similar events have had negative influences on my dreams in the past. \n\nI\u2019ve provided examples of these symptoms in relation to \/just one\/ event, but keep in mind this still occurs for all of my most stressful experiences which are numerous. \n\nIdk. I just feel kinda bad posting this here, because there are people with legitimately debilitating symptoms from horrible experiences and I\u2019m curious about my problems, which are comparably laughable. And I\u2019m worried I\u2019m doing this \u2018for attention\u2019 or to be \u2018special\u2019, which I\u2019m not. I just can\u2019t help worrying about how others will see this post, and whether I can even trust my own motives. Anyway, thanks for your time.

He's completely illogical and has been pressuring me to do things that are not healthy with my PTSD. Whatever is wrong with him has caused him to be so far gone and he no longer acts in any concern for my well-being regarding my trauma. \n\nI have to do something for myself. I have done everything I can to show him I am his regular wife. He is completely out of control and it's breaking my heart to be involved in this. I cannot walk away from our relationship because my heart is tied to him. This is so frustrating and this is suffocating me. I'm not able to heal from my physical injuries because my husband is delusion and accusing me of things that have never happened all the time. I need something to get me through this. I am going to move to Phoenix no matter what. I'm going and that's that. \n\nI'm going to get myself better whether he figures out he loves me or not. Moving to Phoenix and working at a university is my dream. This dream of a stable life with my husband is something I have no control over, though I have done everything good I possibly can. I'm taking back my life right now. \n\nWhat are you working on to better your life that you are looking forward to?"},{"id":"1929_ptsd","text":"Whenever I think about someone for more than a few seconds I break down I cannot stand to think about this person without breaking into tears, but they\u2019re not a bad person or anything, they\u2019re my family.

First, it was all from how traumatic everything was when I saw my dad die and then when some things happened with my ex boyfriend. I'm now married and my husband doesn't believe that PTSD is a real thing. My mother in law just thinks I'm being dramatic about all of it. Last night, I had some bad nightmares and this morning, my husband woke me up by grabbing my arm and getting in my face (new anxiety meds put me in a deep sleep). I told him to get off of me and to stop touching me multiple times and he still kept doing it. It triggered everything and just made me freak out. I ran to the bathroom to be alone but he followed me and banged on the bathroom door calling my name which made everything even more worse. When I managed to get out to take some anxiety meds, he still got in my face and would not leave me alone and eventually ended up throwing my phone at me hard and calling his mom to tell her everything. As usual, he response was that I'm being dramatic and overreacting. \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the nightmares and my husband and his family not understanding what I'm going through.im tired of constantly being told I'm being dramatic.

( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right\u00bf but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone \"stops breathing\" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn .."},{"id":"1940_counseling","text":"There are issues from my past that have me very heavily burdened in my heart.

Yesterday I went to see my psychologist and she agreed it would be best to treat traumas I got from my previous relationship with EMDR, which we are starting next week.\n\nIm not here to talk about my past but I need some practical advice. Im a student in the last month of my (paid)internship and I have been feeling guilty about calling in sick a lot. My supervisors are very understanding and kind, thats why I was able to keep up the work most parts of the months. \n\nBut now Im really struggling with the last straws. I have a paper due and it is stressing me out. Usually I called in sick once every two weeks or worked from home once a week because getting out of my house in the morning gave me anxiety. I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up. Maybe I just need someone to tell me you know its okay to call in sick, you dont have to feel guilty your working on yourself and thats whats most important. I self lack this view because I mostly dont consider myself helpworhty, which is another problem on its own. \n\nI already contacted my mentor from school yesterday. The last time we spoke she told me I could figure it out with the internship company if I knew what would work for me. Problem is, I dont know what works for me. Each day is different. Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go. So I feel like it would give me some rest if I gave myself time to work on this paper or going to the internship part time. That way everyone knows what to expect from me instead of just seeing if I will be able to show up everyday. \n\nOn the other hand, over the holidays when I had some time off I felt awful. I really dont like being on my own all day and had a lot anxiety that I had to show up for work the next week. So being at home all the time didnt work out that well. \nI never called in sick for a longer than a day in the past because the pressure to show up and fear of losing my job or getting kicked out of school. But thats what is getting back to me now cause I dont have a healthy view on how to get better.\n\n\n\n\nAs you see Im constantly questioning myself, I just dont know what would be appropriate for someone in my situation. How do you guys handle this stuff? What do you do to get productive and how do you handle the stress of a deadline when there is so much going on in your head? Have you taken a longer time of work to deal with your mental health and how did that work out?\n\nThank you so much for reading this, I am very new to all this and its a bit of a thing for me to ask advice cause it means admitting I need help. Which would be okay for someone else, I just feel ashamed about the whole situation, its not a walk in the park you know..\n\nTLDR: Gonna start PTSD (EMDR) therapy and dont know if or how I can finish my internship.

I also struggled heavily with [possible trigger warning!](#s \"suicidal thoughts.\") Recently my therapist diagnosed me with OCD and PTSD which has been an eye opener, seeing as to how I've been feeling like something else was up with me, but couldn't figure out what it was until she confirmed it for me. \n\nSince I've been home my wife and I have gotten married and moved into our first home together (we stayed with her parents for the first two months of me coming home). I had a job at a residential care facility, but I quit and decided to work on my health full time until I could handle this stuff better because it was a real struggle working and coping at the same time. But since I quit, it meant it was fully up to my wife to pay the bills and rent. We're managing (barely), but I feel selfish and I want to help. I've gotten better since the start of my treatment and I want to get back into the world to fully turn back to civilian life and learn more about how to live with what I have by getting more used to it. \n\nI looked into being a baker as a job. I feel comfortable working with food and cooking at home. It really helps me take my mind off of my struggles and put them into what I'm doing. Plus baking to me is relaxing and not to difficult of a job. I've found a bakery here where I live and have been thinking about contacting the owner about my situation and applying, but I'm unsure if that's the right way to go about it. I want to the owner to be understanding of my situation though and know what they're getting into hiring me. Not that I'm going to be a nuisance and have a lot of problems, but that I may need a break or two every once and awhile to collect my thoughts and catch my breathe, you know? \n\nI'm also going to talk to my therapist about this on Thursday during our next appointment, but until then I wanted to get this subreddits thoughts on it and if it sounds like a good idea, or if I should even go for it?

We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. \nI was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn\u2019t feel like I was getting better. \nI was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn\u2019t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. \nI saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I\u2019m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. \nI\u2019ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. \nMy medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. \nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can\u2019t handle my grief, I can\u2019t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It\u2019s absolutely horrible. \nI\u2019m a hairdresser and I\u2019ll have clients say certain words to me like \u201chang\u201d \u201ccloset\u201d \u201cdied\/death\u201d \u201cbrother\u201d or make jokes about suicide even though it\u2019s completely out of context I\u2019ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It\u2019s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don\u2019t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. \nI hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can\u2019t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. \nIt is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I\u2019m not ready to explain to the people around me what I\u2019m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. \nIt\u2019s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don\u2019t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. \n\nI can\u2019t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I\u2019m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn\u2019t like me. Advance on getting over that fear would be so appreciated because I KNOW I need some serious therapy right now and my family tells me all the time. Does anyone have any good skills in these areas? Please help me. I\u2019m suffering and I know damn well I can\u2019t go through the rest of my life like this. \n\nTLDR \u2014 My baby brother committed suicide last year, and I ended up developing PTSD from it; I have been having extreme flashbacks and my therapist stopped treating me due to my diagnosis.

Childhood trauma carries its negative effects into our adulthood and affects everyone who loves us.\u00a0Your question is brief, so I'll just try to give general answers as best I can. From my experiences treating many people with your boyfriend's experiences, the short, healthy answer is that you can't fix the situation and maybe not even be able to help. He needs a professional. Period.\u00a0What you can\u00a0do, is take care of yourself. With his background, it is not likely that he will be able to help you or take care of you in a healthy way. Your task needs to prioritize your own safety and well-being. Trauma and substance abuse are the definition of being out of control, unable to set and manage appropriate boundaries, manage his own emotions and behaviors. So your boyfriend is unlikely to be able to change in the near-term, certainly not without professional help. You might also benefit from help and support, to understand your own role in your relationship and how you can make changes in your life. I am NOT blaming you for any aspect of your boyfriend's behavior, only acknowledging that there are two people in every relationship. If you have accepted your boyfriend's drinking and violent outbursts in the past (by staying in the relationship), that is likely to perpetuate his behavior. And there isn't any way to \"handle violent outbursts.\" They shouldn't be handled at all, and if you have to be away from your boyfriend during his outbursts in order to be emotionally and physically safe, then that may be what you will have to do.\u00a0We can never really change anyone else. The only person we can change is ourselves. Sometimes our behavior changes the odds of another person's behaviors, but it doesn't control it. I would recommend that you work with a professional to first, ensure your own safety above all. Then make decisions about what behavior you are willing to accept or be connected to, and which you want to separate from. Whatever your boyfriend does in his life, you will be happier if you manage your own feelings, set boundaries, etc. Let me say again that you also would benefit from some good insight and support as you continue your journey.\u00a0Wishing you and your boyfriend healing and recovery."},{"id":"1994_ptsd","text":"How to deal with PTSD (stuck in the same situation that gave me PTSD) Hey guys I have PTSD from years of emotional abuse and neglect by my narcissistic parents.

If you are feeling like you need to walk on eggshells or that you can't speak your mind and say how you feel, then that sounds like a problem. I would recommend having an open discussion with your husband about communication between the two of you in general. Do this during a time when there is little or no conflict and emotions are not heightened. Let him know how you feel and give him specific ideas of how you would like him to respond instead of saying, \"enough.\" Additionally, try and see his perspective and understand why he shuts you down. Perhaps, he feels like he is being told what to do constantly or that he gets little positive feedback from you. An open\u00a0dialogue about how to discuss issues going forward will likely help.

Over the past 2 years, I've been suffering from what at times felt time paralyzing ptsd that I couldn't escape. I'm in Mountain Rescue, and over the past two years I've had missions with nothing but fatalities. The ones that stuck with me being a mentor of mine who I recovered,and the other a 6 year old boy who was murdered by his cousin. I had gone through therapy, and it certainly helped, I didn't cry on my way home from work anymore, but part of me still felt empty. I even took a trip to Norway recently to catch a break, and my guide got hit by an avalanche. He was buried but I was able to get him uncovered in time that he survived without injury. None the less, it was traumatic and recently I started getting anxious and irritable.\n\nToday I got a mission call out for a missing 7 year old girl who went missing at their families camping vacation last night. Their campsite was right next to a fast river and when I got there and realized this, I was terrified that I might be signing up to recover another child, which wrecked me so much before. I'm happy to say though, after hours of searching, the team was able to find the missing girl in the nearby woods. I cannot say enough how incredibly happy this made me. I cheered out \"fuck yes\" after I heard on the radio \"we've made contact!\". I got back to base and the family was in tears, for once in the past 2 years, tears of joy. I cannot express how impactful this was for me. I had to walk away from my team and I broke into to tears. I was so freaking happy for them. Soon enough, the girl was escorted from the woods and she went running to her parents. They were so happy to have their daughter back, and she too for seeing them again. \n\nI'm sharing this story on here because today, I thought my life was going to be even worse, and have to begin therapy again as I was getting worse and this mission wasnt going to help.

I've suffered from PTSD since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 20 now) and diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18. For years, I would have nightmares where I would relive the experience, which seems pretty common. When I got to about 14, I would go about 2 or 3 days without sleeping to avoid these nightmares because I didn't know how to cope with them. When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.\n\nThe dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating. Everything was going as planned until about 20 minutes in. At this point, I was hearing a man speaking aggressively in French (much like Jacques Brel, but the voice sounded deeper). I'm not fluent in French, so whatever I was hearing is a mystery. The next day a similar thing happened after a nightmare except this time it sounded like a low-flying airplane was in my head. It was loud enough to scare me out of meditation and make my heart race. \n\nThe nightmares have been less frequent since then. I have, however, been experiencing more straightforward hallucinations. Every few hours or so, I'll see a humanoid figure in the corner of my eye. Like someone is behind me watching me. More recently I've also been seeing shadow-like figures running around right in front of me. The other night I was in my girlfriend's room watching a show with her when I noticed in the other corner of the room a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye. I couldn't focus on it enough to make out any features, but I did my best to make sure I really saw something. When I finally glanced over, it was gone. She knew something was up, as I seemed distracted (or maybe she sensed my terror) and asked me what was wrong. I just said I thought I saw something. \n\nI'm afraid to come forward about all of this to anyone in my everyday life. I'm afraid people may think there's something wrong with me. I just need someone to verify that this is normal with PTSD and not another mental illness. I'd also appreciate any anecdotes or advice. Thank you in advance. This has just been scary.

I'm 34. What else is life going to throw at me??\n\nI mean wtf?? I'm so tired of getting knocked back. I've had psychological issues and possible PTSD from the trauma of getting burned as a kid...and my mom never addressed it. She kept saying that something was wrong with me and I needed to get fixed (that I was broken). Well...duh! I suffered trauma at a young age. Then because of her emotional neglect and abuse I've spent the majority of my adult life working on my self worth and going through therapy.\n\nWhen I think life is good...I get hit by a car head on in 2016. I now have chronic pain. It was so hard dealing with all that pain and the hopelessness and depression and PTSD. But I got through it. I started to heal. Then I got a pulmonary embolism in 2017. If the outside world wasn't safe...surely my own body is safe? Wrong.\n\nNow I had PTSD related to body sensations. Being on blood thinners for 8 months was horrible.

Before I'll start I want to mention that I don't intend to insult anyone that suffers from ptsd.\n\nSo after I've read a lot about ptsd I realised that I suffer from some of the symptoms of ptsd. However the 'problem' is that I can't tell if my traumatic experience was 'enough' to let me suffer from ptsd. I should also mention that I suffered from chronic depression for a long time and that I still suffer from anxiety. So it could be that the symptoms are from these illnesses rather than ptsd.\n\nAs I already said I'm not sure if my traumatic experience is 'enough' to trigger ptsd. The main reason why I think that is because whenever I read stories from people that suffer from ptsd they had to experience really awful things that can't be compared to what I experienced. So I kinda feel like I'm a bad person if I just diagnose myself for what I experienced while other people had to live through way worse things.\n\n\nSo here's what I think might have been a trigger for my possible ptsd:\n\nSome years ago I was playing soccer in a good team where only the best of the country could play. I had chances to eventually become a professional player. At the time I was only 11 years old however the pressure from the coaches and the soccer club in general was almost unreal. We had a list of foods which we should and shouldn't eat. I wasn't allowed to go to skiing holidays with my family because the risk of getting injured was too high. We had about 6 times training per week and whenever someone misbehaved the punishment was getting screamed at and doing push ups. And with 'misbehaved' I mean not looking at the coach or not having your hands behind your back while he was talking. For us 11 year old kids this was quite extreme. Everyone was somehow friends but behind the back there was always this envy and fear that the teammates could take your place in the start formation and stuff like that.\n\nAll this pressure from the teammates, parents who wanted their kids to be stars and also from school was simply too much for some of my former teammates. Crying kids before, after or during the training became a normal thing.\n\nThen after I played there for about two years I suddenly got the message that they don't want me to play there anymore. It was a huge shock and the message came out of nowhere. I didn't really know what to feel\/do when I got the message. Everything I worked for since I was 4 years old was suddenly gone. My whole world collapsed that day. I locked myself in my room for some weeks or even months (I can't really remember). Shortly after that, my parents divorced and my grandmother died. I somehow couldn't shed one single tear even though I was really close to my grandmother. I was just so numb.\n\nSome time later I became really depressed and got suicidal thoughts. I had nightmares about this topic for a long time. It was just too much for my 12 year old self. My anxiety got stronger and stronger and I wouldn't talk with anyone if I wasn't asked something or spoke directly to. My whole life felt like a film. It felt like my body wasn't even my body. I had trouble focusing on things and my thoughts were a mess in general.\n\nBefore all that happened I was a extroverted and a joyful person. I was quite cheeky and had a lot confidence. Now I am very anxious, introverted and people always tell me that I look really exhausted and depressed. It's like I'm a whole different person after all that happened.\n\nNow after 5 years I can't remember a lot of the things that happened back then. It seems like my brain has deleted most memories. \n\nSo my question is: Could I have ptsd and should I seek professional help?\n"},{"id":"2037_ptsd","text":"New Years Reminder.

It\u2019s been a rough two years since filled with antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs and I\u2019m looking towards psychotherapy and any advice for help. My ultimate goal is to return to my life medication free. I am scheduled to meet with a psychotherapist this Thursday, so letting everyone know that I\u2019m taking the next steps to better myself already.I will get into my symptoms down below but wanted to start out with a bit of background\n\nI had my intital outburst in a scientific laboratory. I was working really hard towards my masters degree and studying for my mcat when I lost my shit basically. I wasn\u2019t honest with my advisor about how much I thought the work was pushing me to my limits and wasn\u2019t taking my mental health as a priority. I became paranoid believing my colleagues and friends were out to get me. I stayed up for three days without sleep and I had an extreme accident when could have blinded me with scientific materials from the lab. From my stay in the psychiatric hold, my family visited me but they held me for so long because I couldn't come to about all my paranoid thoughts. Eventually, they did die down with the medication and I never saw any hallucinations or voices. I was diagnosed with Bipolar.\n\nSince then, I am quite functional in everyday life. I don't get out of the house much and my social life is lame, and I also don't have a girlfriend. I have a job now but I do still have a few symptoms that I wish would be relieved. I am easily reminded of people from my old work setting and I think things have hidden meanings sometimes. At my worst, I actually thought I was communicating telepathically with a secret society because they wanted my intellectual value in their recruitment. I'll have ideas of reference where I believe people in public are specifically talking about something associated with me.\n\nI think a lot of my issue is that I\u2019m critical of people and critical of myself. I know that it could be underneath all this that I have low self esteeem and maybe that I even didn\u2019t have enough confidence in myself to do the work that I was doing before my accident.\n\nAm I even more out there to think that this sort of paranoia will sustain ever? I've been medicated which makes me think this is not a biological problem but rather a psychological one. I believe that with the right help and my own willpower that I can overcome my past and lead the life I want to live. I feel like if I were to socialize more and even get a girlfriend that my life would be better and less stressful.\n\nAlso, what should I expect from the psychotherapist? Will it be one of the therapist who believe medicine is the answer or one like some of my previous therapists that think I can overcome this without medication. I wanted to try psychotherapy mainly because of Jordan B Peterson and is youtube videos I've watched. Plus, I didn't feel that much of a connection and want to be picky if I'm paying to talk to somebody."},{"id":"2048_counseling","text":"Every day for five years, my husband mentally abused me and said he will change.

You're not a \"member of society\", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to \"deserve\" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor\/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive\/escape your circumstances. \"Poor\/homeless\" is all they need to know to \"know\" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.\n\nEven after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor\/homeless people.

I believe most therapists would agree that this type of behavior is indicative of emotional AND verbal abuse.  And quite often the two overlap because someone who is being yelled at and demeaned is also frequently having his\/her emotions preyed upon as well. \u00a0Healthy Place\u00a0offers us some great examples of emotional abuse which certainly fit the criteria of what you describe:Yelling or swearing\u00a0Name calling or insults; mocking. Threats and intimidation. Ignoring or excluding. Isolating. Humiliating. Denial of the abuse and blaming of the victim. And abuse survivor and author, Kellie Jo Holly, offers some other great examples of verbal abuse:Emotionally Abusive StatementsYou\u2019re so cute when you try to concentrate!

I'm sorry if I'm ignorant and offend anyone who does have to deal with PTSD everyday, but here's my story:\n\nEver since I joined the military 3+ years ago at the age of 23, my life has improved dramatically, I was truly happy and felt like myself. I was doing \"wild\" things like partying and clubbing on the weekends and even one night stands with strangers from the bar or online dating apps, and other \"wild fun\" things (that I prefer not to mention for the sake of my career) I would NEVER thought I'd do based on who I \"was\" prior military.\n\nHowever, the happier I'm becoming the more angrier I have been getting lately thinking about my past. I'm talking about being cheerful and jolly one minute, singing with the radio driving home from work then suddenly out of no where I'll have flashbacks of shitty times in my childhood    and next thing you know I'm punching my steering wheel and clenching my jaw and just really want to fly back across the United States just to give my family whom I RARELY talk to now, a piece of my mind.\n\n I grew up in a conservative Chinese family. Being a Chinese male, I had a very \"stereotypical\" boring childhood and even lamer time in highschool and college. However, I was not a good student and was a handful as a child that I will admit but I have never thought that my family was abusive until lately and even talked to my co-workers about it.\n\nTo keep things from getting too long I'll list out the things I experienced growing up and always thought was normal until my coworkers and friends pointed out it really wasn't:\n\n- I was strongly influenced to not have friends and always put my family before anyone.\n\n- Even until I was 22 years old I was not to be trusted to have friends over the house without an adult or my brother whom was allowed to have friends over anytime he pleased since he was 18\n\n- My brother (5 years older than me) got to decide whether I can go out or must stay home regardless if there was a reason or not.\n\n- My brother can also tell me I can't have any friends over even when I was 21 years old and still lived with me and my parents.\n\n- My brother would enforce me as a child to \"pat-down\" all my friends who came over to the apartment we lived in to ensure nobody stole anything. This rule did not apply to my brother's friends.\n\n- My mother has threatened to kill herself  and me multiple times when I was a child growing up. Sometimes she would take a meat cleaver to her neck and scream at me and my brother that shes going to cut her head off and kill herself because of us. And sometimes -\n\n- My mother would swerve into the wrong side of the road towards oncoming traffic when we were bad, threatening to kill us and herself.\n\n- When my brother was old enough to drive and he would also swerve into oncoming traffic if I he was mad at me or if we got into a disagreement.\n\n- Ironically, when I was old enough to drive, I also did the same thing to a friend who is still considered one of my closest friend to this day. He pissed me off and I thought threatening his life would help me win the argument.\n\n- I also remember when I was very young my mom told me not to go outside because I had some kind of allergy or Asthma, I did not listen and helped my grandma with her yard because she was going to pay me 20$. I told her and she put her hands around my neck shook my neck and told me she was going to kill me, very angrily and very convincing at least at the time to me.\n\n- More less severe things is that my brother acted like he owned me, like if I wanted to go out and my mother said I could and my brother said I can't he would threaten to take away my games.\n\n- whenever he disallowed me to do things he would sometimes include statements like \"not in my house\" this fucking bitch didn't own shit. He's had three cars handed to him and gave me shit and tried to claim he bought one of the my mom bought him brand new, which I confronted my mom about. \n\n- I believe my step-dad might have caught on to my brother's bullshit and convinced my mom and him that it was time for him to move out.\n\nAnyways , I literally just started having angry flashbacks just now while writing the last three. I think I have more of a grudge towards my brother than my mother. I'll stop here before I go on forever but thank you for those who read this far, I honestly feel that I needed this more to vent than to really seek an answer."},{"id":"2083_ptsd","text":"How will I ever feel safe?

He stopped, and yelled back at me, you cant even say hi you white bitch. \n\nI'm walking to the subway and a group of younger city kids pass me, they start saying stuff to me and when they pass me, I still hear them. I say \"stfu\" as I pass them, fed up with the fucking day. They stop and threaten to fight me. \n\nI'm walking to get my dinner and on my way home a homeless man is screaming MISS MISS following me, I sprinted away. \n\nThere is a building of projects across from me.

I hear a guy say hi and whistling from a car parked on the street, but I didnt see which one it was coming from. \n\nI was walking to the river another day and a homeless drugged up man started saying hi and walking towards me and when I didnt respond and walked away he screamed IM GONNA GET YOU til I was out of distance. \n\nI go on the subway.. WITH my boyfriend for the first time in a while. A bunch of city kids get on and start doing a very very loud, screaming, violent type performance. I was triggered and they were stomping back and forth down the train cart. It was so long til the next stop. They kept coming over to us and across from me was the only other white girl on the cart. He puts his fist out for her to pound it. She didnt at first but he didnt move, so she did. Then he comes over to me and puts his fuckin fist out. My bf put his hand in front of me and pounded him for me. He walked away. He did this to the only two white girls on the train, even when I was with my bf. \n\nI was on a train alone and a bunch of city kids got on and were hanging from the subway handles and started talking shit about white girls and dumb bitches. \n\nI was walking to my apartment and heard a guysaying, blondie, blondieee behind me. \n\nI was walking on the river and a city guy passed me and said PUT A SMILE ON. Then I gave him a death stare and he called me a bitch. \n\nI've been raped by one of these city, drug dealer type guys. I live in this city alone. In my hometown these types of bad people would stalk me and pick on me for some reason. I'm a walking target. I dont feel safe leaving my house to go to the corner store. I'm scared to go on the subway to go ANYWHERE now. I dont have money to uber everywhere. It's so hard cause this could be real danger. It's so triggering and idk what to do. There is no one I know in this city or state. My bf is 2.5 hours away and very busy working full time. I am no contact and estranged from all family members and friends. I have a new therapist but even getting to her office is a fucking long trigger. \n\nAND WHAT PISSES ME OFF IS THAT.......if you dont respond to these people.. they WILL retaliate. And how fucked up is that? How fucked up is it to go on a subway and have a stranger shove their hand in your face for a \"pound.\" And what if she didnt do it? She had no choice but to touch a fucking strangers hand that was invading her personal space, minding her own business on the train. They get mad when they are rejected because they look like idiots, when they are trying to be cool and have game when they do it. Are they trying to scare me on purpose? Are they this stupid?

But I used to live in a nicer, expensive area that I cant afford. Even in those places there is crime.. I lived at my bf's before in the mountains and it was fucking hell. I didnt have a car and there were no stores within 30 min drive and no fun or anything. So I guess I need to settle for something in the middle. What sucks is that I am all alone.. I have no money or support... idk where I'll be at the end of the month.... my bf was supposed to get us a place but he bailed on me.. now I'm on my own. I feel bad getting mad at him for not visiting me, and not seeing him, and needing him just for me to leave my house and stuff.. I dont wanna put it on him but I literally have no one else.

We live in a world where we are constantly exposed and connected to people who intrigue us and to whom we might feel a connection. I believe that our ability to protect our relationships from the risks involved here has not developed fast enough.\u00a0Your friend came face to face with what leaving the marriage meant...huge changes and many intense emotions. He is wise to consider his choices carefully; especially if you have children, there is good reason to work at a relationship that is less than fulfilling. Therapy can help.So you fell in love with a man who was in an unstable place. He's taking the steps to create some stability for himself and that leaves you \"on hold\", not knowing what his decision will be. I love that you seem willing to give him the space he needs to figure it all out. This decision is his.\u00a0For yourself, you can accept that being \"best friends\" with a man might not be a wise thing. Many marriages don't fair well when friendships like that exist. You flirted with danger; both of you. You fell in love but he wasn't free, really. I'm sure his love for you is real and powerful, but it's not a competition. It's one man choosing his life path. You can focus on thoughts like this:He has the right to choose his life.We flirted with danger by being best friends.I know he does love me; this is not a reflection on my worth.I can feel really good about giving him patience and the space he needs.I feel proud of his honesty.I feel proud if he's willing to fight for his marriage; lucky her...lucky kids.Acknowledge and allow yourself to feel that sadness, that grief. It's real.If you have told anyone about the affair, seek the support of that trusted person and know you have to grieve this in silence because it was born in silence.

Maybe I'm exaggerating or I dreamed all of it? I'm struggling with my recent PTSD diagnosis and want to know your experiences post diagnosis. \n\nHey Everyone,   \nFirst time poster here because I got diagnosed with PTSD after my 21 years of life. I also have anxiety and depression. I'm just having trouble with coming to terms with my PTSD diagnosis because I got diagnosed on Friday. This is very new to me and I'm questioning if what I went through was even abuse? Here are the five significant events I told my therapist about that led him to come to this conclusion:   \n\n\n1. My biological father used to hit my mother when they were together. He'd come home, accuse her of cheating, and begin beating her. This is one of my earliest childhood memories: him beating my mom. \n2. My oldest brother (30M) often groped me when I was a kid. From about ages 8-14, he'd either come up and randomly cup my ass and make some weird comment, or he'd touch my developing boobs. I hate that this happened, because if my boob accidentally brushes against something random (say, a blanket or a headphone wire while I'm in bed), I feel disgust and anger, even in my college dorm, where I live alone. I also feel conflicted because I still have love for my brother for all he does for me: Aren't I supposed to hate him? If I don't hate him, was it really abuse? I don't know and this is one of the biggest parts that makes me struggle with coming to terms with my PTSD. I know that I HATE it when he taps me on my shoulder and I get very angry, and I hate being alone with him, which also makes me sad because he relies on me for friendship, like going to the movies. But I HATE the feeling of being alone with him. \n3. My second oldest brother (24M) would threaten to physically fight me growing up. Me, having been a rebellious preteen, would get upset with him when he'd talk to my mom disrespectfully. This would quickly spiral into a fight, to where he'd raise his fist up at me and try to physically fight me as if I was a boy of his size. I'd tell him \"If you're gonna hit me, do it!\" and he'd end up leaving the house. My mom would cry and ask me why I made him leave. He'd also frequently argue with my mom and brother to where it would escalate into tears and shouting. Our most recent verbal argument was about a year or two ago, where he started screaming about me over a phone call with my mother and said \"Tell her not to talk to me before I slap the shit out of her\". The reason I never saw this as fucked up is because people have been telling me \"oh I fight with my brothers too!\" and I just shut down because maybe I'm just exaggerating. \n4. One of my mom's (now ex) boyfriends came home drunk and bruised at about 4am. He woke me up and tried to get on top of me and made kissing faces at me. I tried to pull him off, but couldn't. My mom ended up pulling him off and dressing his wounds from a bar fight he'd gotten into. If this was abuse, wouldn't my mom have kicked him out or questioned him? I never brought this up because I know my mom would tell me that I'm exaggerating or that maybe I dreamed it. \n5. I was sitting on a stoop when I was about 15, and a guy in a white van pulled up in front of my house. He was using his tongue to make really gross, sexually suggestive faces at me. I was frozen in fear, but eventually ran up into my apartment. When I told my mom, she got upset with me for not texting her so she could open our apartment window and yell at him. Later that evening, my oldest brother was recounting the event to my mom's partner (amazing guy), and said that I was stupid and that \"if I ever got raped, it would be my own fault\".   \n\n\nIn my eyes, I never saw these as trauma. I just saw them as a couple of kinda fucked up situations, but it was childhood and life. Some of these are incredibly foggy too, so I don't see them as trauma since I can't remember the specifics of the events, so what if I just convinced myself that these events happened? I can't remember it specifically, so what if these events were, in fact, just dreams? Since I've talked about it, my dreams are vivid and I haven't been able to sleep well. This whole \"PTSD\" thing is really fucking me up, but it'd explain why I hate sudden loud noises, doors slamming, sudden shouting, people touching me, and why I can't walk alone at night without looking around me an excessive amount.   \nIdk, I'm new to PTSD (or rather, it being called that in my life). Do any of you guys take medicine for PTSD (not asking for medical advice, just asking about your experiences)? What are your experiences? I guess I'm asking because I didn't think I had PTSD or that my life would result in this.

I've been dealing with depression and generalized anxiety for over three years, so my life has been colourfully scattered with panic attacks and random depressive episodes. I worked really hard to ignore them and wait to seek treatment until I was an adult, as I was afraid that I was faking my symptoms and didn't have a problem because it was just \"teenager hormones\". I also have never been great at taking care of myself. When I entered college this year I was walking in, completely in denial about my issues and unprepared to take care of myself. \n\n\nIt took me only a week to have a melt down lmao. I had the worst panic attack of my life, I couldn't see and couldn't move and thought I was having a seizure. I quickly figured out that this wasn't working and sought a doctor who I later realized was not-great for treatment, who prescribed me Zoloft and Zopiclone, sleeping pills that I had previously had an addiction problem with. The Wednesday of my second week I immediately attempted suicide, had breakdowns every time I was left alone, downed pills like it was candy and was thankfully admitted to the hospital on Friday. There were so many fucking awful things I went through that week and I was out of control, and the suicide attempt scared the shit out of me. My therapist later told me the doctors theorized that my history of depression + my bad reaction to the Zoloft had led to my situation. I spent a week in a child psychiatric unit and dropped out of my college. There's so many other things I could talk about but this post is already long enough and that's not what this post is about.\n\n\nI'm terrified of what happened to me. I'm in a really great environment right now\u2014 I have an amazing support system, am able to stay in a lovely home with understanding parents who want the best for me. It's been almost two months now since the whole ordeal and I'm in recovery from my depression, seeing therapists and have a new doctor. I feel better. But I can't shake the experience and it keeps popping up.\n\n\nThe college I was at has offered me guaranteed admission into the winter semester, but I can't go back. When I returned to the college a couple days after I left the hospital I was fine, but I couldn't enter the bathroom I had a panic attack in. I was also roommates with a lifelong best friend of mine during this whole ordeal who I am no longer friends with because of how she dealt with everything. I can't stand the thought of going back to the college, the one I walked around in a drug-fuelled stupor and the one that contains an ex-childhood friend who dealt with my episode in the worst possible way. I'm also intensely afraid of going back to the way I used to be. I've never been one that's been afraid of the future, like going to college\u2014 these things have always excited me. But now things like school, work, living with roommates\/independently; they scare the shit out of me. I have hazy memories of suffering from depression at night whilst pushing myself through shifts at work in the day or at school and I don't want to go through that again. I'm afraid to live with others and cause them problems again with my issues. Maybe I'm just being lazy, but the idea of going back to things like that stresses me out and has caused panic attacks. At the moment I am slated to get a job in the next week so I can work until January, then live with a friend in the city until summer, but the more I move closer to it the more I want to stay home until the next fall semester. I'm just scared of taking on responsibilities and putting myself through stress again, and letting others down. \n\n\nI was actually supposed to move in with a friend right away and went to live at her apartment for a trial week, and I wanted to leave after about three days and go home. I also slept in her bunk bed last Thursday night and woke up in the middle of the night, and thought for a moment I was back in my old college dorm (I slept in a bunk bed there too), remembered everything I went through and had a panic attack. \n\n\nOther mini-things like listening to old music I listened to, feeling anxiety\/stress, having people ask me if I'm okay, deadlines etc. all are very likely to make me cry or get really pissed off and afraid. I constantly feel guilty asking things from anyone and I'm so vulnerable to stress that even the tiniest little things get me on edge and cause extreme reactions. I'm also having a big problem with memory since it is one of the side-effects of abusing Zopiclone; so much so that I barely remember my life before now and if I do I am not emotionally connected to them (I feel like a completely different person now, so doing stuff the \"old me\" does also makes me panic). \n\n\nSorry this is so long, I suppose this was sort of a vent as well, but I'm just really scared. I don't know if it's just a natural reaction to this sort of experience, it's PTSD, or it's just me being lazy? I'm saving this post so I can talk to my therapist about it but I just wanted the opinions of others. Is it possible to get PTSD from a suicide attempt\/my experiences? Or does this just sound like a natural reaction, and if so\u2014 how long does this last?\n\n\nThe more things move the more I want them to slow down, and everyone in my life is trying their best to accommodate me so I feel bad asking them to do it even more. If I need to push through and do it, I want to try my best; but I don't want to push myself too hard and risk anything like this happening again.

Resume brief homelessness and stress of recovering after fire #2. Red cross offers no help to even transport me anywhere because I have 2 dogs. My phone is in the burned building. I have no family or friends nearby. I don't even have shoes on. Mental state falls apart. Can't take time off work long due to money. Cause problems with boss\/at work due to emotional instability\/unwillingness to take a schedule change. Boss says I should bring him a doctors note saying I have problems after I oversleep one day due to having a panic attack the night prior.

I am scared every time a machine in the wall hums weirdly. I am scared when I hear sirens or alarms and sometimes mistake phone rings and stuff for them. I hallucinate smoke when I walk into rooms sometimes. I am scared when I have to drive, and terrified when it is in snow. I am scared of my bosses. I am scared of losing my job. I am scared of calling in when flashbacks and panic attacks interrupt sleep. I am scared of becoming homeless again. I am scared of wasting time feeling miserable only to die before anything gets better. I am indignant and frustrated that I cannot motivate myself to try any harder to get out of here. I am angry I do not have any parents to fall back on or ask for help or money. I am angry there is no way for me to easily get to Oregon. I am angry I feel as tired as I do and people are still mean. I am angry my job doesn't give me insurance. I am angry I make too much for assistance despite how like a stupid feral child I am, but seemingly not enough to afford consistent care.

I\u2019m not sure (to scared to tell my mom that I may have it) I am not sure what it is but it may be ptsd...\n(Sorry if there is bad grammar or anything I didn\u2019t want to go over it)[sorry if I repeated my self in this it\u2019s 12:40Am) What\u2019s happening to me: I am 14 years old in my family my mom and her bf have fought a lot and still do fight. I live with my mom, her bf,my brother ,and my little sister.i am normally the only sibling at the house when they start to argue,well except for my little sister but she is always asleep when it happens. First they start off arguing and it get annoying bc Ik they r going to start fighting!...but then they start to yell loud enough for me to hear what they r saying.sometimes I tell them to stop or I just leave them alone bc they say I make it worse.Im not gonna say what they fight about... but it get pretty bad sometimes. Some of them have turned into physical fights,well most of them...and I always see all of it!and I have seen my mom get pushed and her finger get snapped\/broken by her bf.she obviously has to fight back for self defence so she does..but he try\u2019s to convince her to give him another chance and that he will change.he says that every single time and yet he still haven\u2019t changed.I even told my mom that...they suffer from alcohol education and my mom thinks that\u2019s the only way she can fall asleep.and some times she gets black out drunk and gets mad at me easy and when I say something that makes her upset... she takes it out on me and if not me her bf mostly her bf tho.. but some fight have scared me half to death bc I thought it was gonna end up in death. I thought one of them was gonna get killed.And if they r fighting downstairs I can hear them hitting each other if it\u2019s physical or if they r going at each other or push each other and it makes a loud noise, like a bang on the ground or something.\nBut the things I\u2019m experiencing (the after effects) they don\u2019t know about...\nLet me explain.\nSo I have bad anxiety(I haven\u2019t rly been diagnosed with it but my mom know I have it and it\u2019s rly bad to the point where I have anxiety attacks) but I always get triggered when I hear a big stomp upstairs, I always think it\u2019s them fighting again and I get rly scared, but when I go up it\u2019s just my siblings playing around,and I have to try and clap down.\n(Loud bangs,slap sounds ,yells,other noises)scare me anxiety kicks in right away. Also sometimes I wake up and I think they are fighting again but I go down and they are sleeping and it\u2019s just the tv,but it sounded like they are fighting.so I Can\u2019t rly go back to sleep easy. Or if they are talking loud r sometimes just talking Normally and I\u2019m upstairs in my room it\u2019s sound like they are arguing and my anxiety get triggered and I feel like I want to cry,even when my mom is talking on the phone she kinda talks loud a lot bc I think she is losing hearing a little,so she talks a little louder than needed and it triggers me bc I keep thinking I hear them arguing but it\u2019s just them talking normally.\nI have watched this YouTube video and there where parents arguing in it and I immediately started crying bc it gave me some kinda flash back ig and it sounded exactly like there fighting. Sometimes I can\u2019t sleep especially when they argue. And when I\u2019m class the topic of abuse or any kind of toxic family topic come up I have to leave the class and clam down. It also doesn\u2019t help that my neighbour has bad anxiety and screams at night sometimes and I wake up rly scared bc I think my they are fighting. I don\u2019t know exactly what to call it bc I don\u2019t want to diagnose my self but I think it could be ptsd and yes it trauma I have gone through other things in my life as in seeing someone get stabbed but I don\u2019t worry about those as much because I can\u2019t remember them as much as what I am going threw rn... if u read this that is my story and thanks for taking the time to see what\u2019s happening this is my first time posting on here pls don\u2019t judge me &lt;3"},{"id":"2146_ptsd","text":"Triggers and flashbacks \ud83d\ude41 The fact that I didn\u2019t even think of this until the evening of New Years Day is progress, I suppose. \n\nFor my first job after college, I worked with a nonprofit in a third world country.

So Jamie and I had a lot in common, and immediately became friends. I was new in town and she was my first friend.\n\nThe trouble started a year later, (I was 12 at this point, yup I know I'm young) when she started making some horrible comments. For example I told her I was bullied at my last school and she smirked and said \"Oh, so you're an easy target\" It felt weird, I wasn't sure how to react.\n\nLater, when school started again, she kept making comments like those or about my body. I definitely was an early bloomer and she was as well, but she really bugged me about some things about myself.\n\nThen, she molested me. Several times.\n\nAt first it was subtle touches, and she told me she was just physical with friends. I thought it was weird because she wasn't that way with other people.\n\nThen it got worse, like a lot worse. Not rape, but intense making out etc.\n\nSo that happened at the end of the school year and I didn't see her over the summer.\n\nIt was the worse summer of my life, and when school started I was extremely suicidal. At this point, I told a close friend. They helped me a lot.\n\nJamie took it way too far a few days ago. I'm shaken over it. I just want to get her out of my life.\n\nJamie is still abusing me.\n\nBut here's my problem. I want to report Jamie, I really do. But I feel like I can't for two main reasons\n\n1.

Graphic detail.) I\u2019m no stranger to C-PTSD. I was officially diagnosed in 2017 after major trauma I dealt with at the hands of a mental health facility. \n\nI know waking up myself and the whole household screaming in my sleep, hearing sounds and voices relating to my trauma, and sleeping with the lights on for years well. I was finding my symptoms easing and being easier to deal with in late 2019 thanks to extensive therapy and working through them one by one but then my Mom died on January 1st of this year right after midnight. \n\nIt was the simple call and \u201cwe regret to inform you,\u201d no. We had went to visit her in ICU. ICU had become a normal occurrence in the infections she kept having but she always bounced back. \n\nWhen we walked in, she didn\u2019t seem any worse than the times before... and then a nurse pulled me to the side to tell me it was bad bad. \n\nI still didn\u2019t believe it, but while we were there they said they were putting her on a ventilator, and I decided to stay the night. \n\nDue to my moms infection and my slight germaphobia, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable holding her hand or being in cough range. Even before the ventilator, she couldn\u2019t respond more than panicked eyes that never looked directly at me and hoarse \u201chelp me\u201d\u2019s between breaths. I couldn\u2019t get her attention even when I did try to tell her it\u2019d be okay and to comfort her. Seeing her like that was crushing me. I decided to let the nurses do their thing while I wished everyone on my social media a happy new year. \n\nThe nurses came in and out to add meds and such to help her breathe, kicked me out to put the ventilator in, but when I was allowed back in they never were gone for more than 10 minutes. I watched my moms machine, and it didn\u2019t stop beeping since we had gotten there but that was normal when o2 levels are below 90. \n\nShe started calming down some so I laid down to sleep. I was checking my phone one last time for the night when a nurse came RUNNING in. \nThe machine hadn\u2019t made a different sound or anything but apparently my mother\u2019s heart had stopped. \n\nWithin seconds the room got filled with folks providing CPR. A doctor came in and told me to tell her if I wanted them to stop. \n\n5 minutes passed, then 7, then 10. It didn\u2019t feel like I though. I\u2019m just sitting there in shock and unsure what to do. The doctor informs me her ribs are broken and if she does suddenly make it she\u2019s gonna be in a ton of pain but at this point we were just torturing her. \n\nBlood was in her breathing tube. Her eyes looked gone. I told them to stop. \n\nI remember feeling super numb and floaty. I hadn\u2019t slept in months. My boyfriend wasn\u2019t answering the phone and I didn\u2019t know what the fuck to do but it didn\u2019t matter because I couldn\u2019t think. \n\nEventually I just allowed the numb to take over.

Any comment from you guys will be very appreciated! \n\nSo I recently broke up with my girlfriend over a big fight. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had a fight like this and every-time we get into an argument she tends to get very defensive and start attacking me. She gets into this rage of cursing me out loud regardless of where we are or who we are with and goes on for 30 minutes. In the beginning of the relationship, I thought this to be more nothing more than anger management and her personality. She tends to be very aggressive with her words and starts attacking the other person when she feels like she gets taken advantage of. There are a few restaurants that Im still ashamed to go because my ex and I caused a very unpleasant scene. I mean everyone gets like that when they get mad but it was way too extreme. She had so much hatred and negativity against certain type of people and would even mention of hurting the others at extreme.\n\nAfter the breakup, I had some time to catch up with a friend. We were just having a couple of drinks just chatting and the word \u201cPTSD\u201d was brought up. And this word instantly hit me so hard... I mean folks I never experienced it and never thought I would meet anyone who had it. But deep inside me I knew my ex was going through PTSD. \n\nOne of the symptoms she had was nightmare. She never shared her nightmare with me except for once and I never insisted on her telling me since it always put her in a bad mood. But that time she told me, it\u2019s someone trying to attack her and she cant seem to do anything about it..... The other physical symptoms she had (at least thats what I think) were her migraines. She was very sensitive to noises. She would scream in th middle of the night and scared the shit out of me. She also would jerk her leg at night saying it hurts and would not be able to go to sleep. She told me she has a bad memory. All of this indicate that she has PTSD but I was oblivious to the symptoms.  Now that I have learned this, I only have regrets of not being more understanding and guiding her in th right direction.

I was married for five to a man who was emotionally abusive, and I caught him cheating on me three different times, with men and women, using the internet. Each time it happened it was like hell breaking loose inside of me. Once was bad enough, then two more times on top of it. The most damning part was he pretended to care about our family and about me and presented this image to the world as the greatest guy and everyone loved him but behind my back and everyone\u2019s back he did these horrible things like he was two people. I once caught him on social media impersonating a high school girl trying to get pictures but he destroyed the evidence before I could call the police. \n\nNow I am in a relationship with a man who is actually a good man but it\u2019s like I can\u2019t shut this part of my brain off that associates social media, technology, things of this nature, where my boyfriend is concerned, as perceived threats. When I don\u2019t manage myself manually through the use of CBT and DBT from therapy, my brain is on autopilot in hypervigilance....anything associated with social media (which is how I found him three times) it\u2019s like at certain times usually when I\u2019m ill or tired or stressed it\u2019s like I feel this vein of anxiety open up in me and out it comes...all the feelings that I felt that night, the other night, the night after, of the horror and despair of seeing him doing awful things behind my back. And I have to scan and stalk and research deeply into my boyfriend\u2019s social media to try to quiet this desperation that\u2019s roaring inside of me to find anything. It\u2019s like I wish I could say I did it to self-sooth but the truth is really I do it to self-protect. If I go searching for it and find it, then it won\u2019t hurt as bad. If I mistrust ahead of time and I make a discovery then I beat the terror and despair. The vein of anxiety only gets worse. And suddenly I see things that aren\u2019t even there. A liked photo of a female must represent....so much. And I\u2019ve come unglued over absolutely nothing in the past, but I will seize upon something in these moments, anything, and the vein of anxiety erupts like a volcano and I can\u2019t breathe I\u2019m shaking I\u2019m numb.

It came back\" a mixture of fireworks and stress. (vent) This will be a brief account of the last few weeks and what it culminated in. Over the last couple of weeks, fireworks have been going off all over my part of town. Often, the people who are doing it set them off late at night 1 or 2 am.  My PTSD, after an incident with people throwing fireworks and a near riot, is triggered by fireworks, bright lights, loud sounds and people in a confined space. I have for the last two years kept this under wraps with a few problems along the way like zoning out or feeling rising panic in some situations, as well as some sensor issues.  \n\n\nEither way, back to the fireworks in my town. With the fireworks at night, I have found that if I start my bed rutin again or get a specific fluffy blanket I can usually calm and soothe myself to sleep.  However a few days ago, just before New Year's eve as I was walking from the bus station after dropping my friends off, I noticed some kids running towards me. Thinking they were running to the bus I sidestepped out the way and kept going. Then it happened, I was close to coming round the corner and then \"bang\". A big flash of red light and sparks flew from around the corner. My first reaction was to stand still and as the last kid past me, I struggled not to grab onto him. My next reaction was to feel like crying. Which after a brief feeling of outer bodyness turned into a need for a smoke. I recently, and frustratingly, bought a packet of cigarets due to the bangs and the stress they were causing me. After that I then got back did the washing and tried to call the police non-emergency line to no avail, gave up and drank some whiskey. This obviously was a bad idea and just made me feel even worse. The follow on from that was to clean like a maniac.  \n\n\nRoll on new year's eve and fireworks are everywhere, people on squares and roadsides. I was with my friend so it was a little better. At our party it seemed to miss a lot of the fireworks, We saw the new year in and crashed.  The day after new year's day, everything came crashing down. My reaction to stress was to just sleep and after I tried to get some work done I just broke down and smoked all my cigarettes. The stress and isolation this brought just hit me with a large hammer. Why was it like this? Who could I contact?. I tried contacting one of my friends and gave up. Then a feeling of needing to get out of this came about me and I got scared. I knew I had alcohol at home and that was a risk. So I ended up ringing my friend and ask them to be an accountabl\u00f6ity buddy for the night, as I was scared  I was going to go on a binge.   \n\n\nToday, after writing this out I have eaten which was hard to do over the last few days and I have finished tidying.

When I was 16, we went through a home-invasion in the middle of the night, in which I and my parents were shot. My parents and brother were also beaten. Though we all survived (by mere heartbeats, and with some permanent injuries), the level of violence and disregard for human life we experienced is grotesque.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe live in South Africa.

Maybe hear similar stories. I've been trying to not talk about it too much to my friends and family because it was traumatic for them, too, and I'm sure they're sick of hearing about it. I'll try to keep this as short as possible but I know it's gonna be long. I apologize in advance. \nI was in a pretty bad accident on Christmas eve night, and I've been suffering badly from it, mentally and physically. \nMy mom was driving me back to drop me off at my apartment after we were running some last minute errands when a guy runs a red light and t-bones us. He was going over the speed limit and didn't see us, so he didn't brake. I saw the headlights coming from the corner of my eye and screamed but my mom didn't have time to react. \nHis mini van hits us right on my door. I, unfortunately, didn't have my seatbelt buckled like I normally do, but it's not a law in our state. \nIt happened exactly like it does in the movies. In the seconds before the impact, I just expected everything to fix itself. I expected the car to just stop. I keep replaying that moment in my head. Especially when I'm in the car now and I see headlights coming through the passenger window. The window shatters on me, the airbag goes off, my door caves in on me. Everything goes red then a pale orange. \nOur car spins what feels like a million times and when we stop everything smells like smoke. I hear screaming and it takes me a while to realize it's me screaming. My mom gets out before I even realize we've stopped moving. I can't get out, my door is caved in. I feel like the car is going to explode and I can't do anything. I'm sure that I'm going to be set on fire. My whole face feels wet and I notice blood dripping onto my jacket. I can't open my right eye. Maybe I was just too scared. I don't know. My mom pulls me out of the car from the drivers side. \nFrom the sounds of it, there were a lot of people watching. Two people help me walk to the sidewalk and sit me down in the snow. They try to get me to stop screaming. One woman, who I later learned had medical training of some sort, got a clean towel from her house and put it over my eye. Her daughter was on the phone with 911. She was trying to help me breathe but I was hysterical. I ask if everyone in the other car is okay. She says they're all okay, I'm the only one bleeding. \nAt the hospital, they take two pieces of glass out of my eye, right below my eyebrow. By some miracle, all I have is a concussion, the stitches from the glass above my eye, lots of bruising and some cuts from the glass. I'm gonna be out of work for 1-2 weeks. The general consensus is that I'm very lucky I didn't die. I have lost about 6 of my old classmates to car accidents alone this year. \nOn one hand, I do feel lucky. I should've been in worse shape. On the other hand, to be honest, most days I wake up, I wished it killed me. I feel like I'm trapped in my own life now. Being in cars now is suffocating. I feel like I'm trapped in a box underwater. Loud noises, the smell of smoke, seeing headlights, walking too close to the road, the sound of car horns. Fireworks. Doors closing too hard. Everything scares me. The drives to my doctors appointments are excruciating. I think about what it might've been like if I just died. \nI feel completely out of control of everything. I obsess over everything I can't control now. Natural disasters, house fires, accidents of any kind. I don't want anyone to leave my sight because if I can't see them in front of me, then I don't know they're safe. It feels so unfair this guy just got to rip away my peace of mind. I've become so preoccupied with control. What I can control, what I can't control, what others around me can control. \nI have PTSD already, from childhood abuse and a sexual assault that happened two years ago. I also have OCD which is probably responsible for my new obsessive thoughts. \nMaybe it's dramatic. My injuries are minor compared to what could've happened. But I feel completely broken.

We went out on two dates, and then despite her original plans on how to pace and conduct the relationship, I ended up at her house on a the Friday night one week after our first date. We respectfully tried not to have sex, but after hours of trying to resist each other, we gave in and we had sex. After that, I slept at her house every night for almost two weeks. Then one day, she went to her family\u2019s house on Thanksgiving and everything changed. Within the short time we were together, we got so close and serious really fast. We had finally found each other. We told each other that we loved each other all the time, even while we were making love. A few days after Thanksgiving, she told me that we would have to go back to her original plans of seeing each other much less frequently. I was very hurt and didn\u2019t understand. Then another week later, she told me she couldn\u2019t do it at all anymore. I was crushed!\r\n\r\nA few days later, she tells me how much she\u2019s missing me and \u201clet\u2019s get together for lunch\u201d or something like that. Then about two weeks later, we finally get together one night and we were so hot for each other (in love, not just sex), but she confessed that the reason for the sudden distance was that the father of her very young child told her he wants to get back together and this totally messed with her. So for her child\u2019s sake, she is now considering the possibility of allowing that to happen. She had told me all about him previously, and it is definite that she has little to no attraction to him, but she would do this putting herself in misery again for her child. Our love for each other is fully established and acknowledged, but she is torn and confused. She doesn\u2019t even think it would work between them as she had to kick him out before for not fulfilling his role properly. I know she needs time, and all I can do is take care of myself. We have agreed to remain friends, and if this doesn\u2019t work out for her, we will try again.

I've suffered from PTSD since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 20 now) and diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18. For years, I would have nightmares where I would relive the experience, which seems pretty common. When I got to about 14, I would go about 2 or 3 days without sleeping to avoid these nightmares because I didn't know how to cope with them. When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.\n\nThe dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating. Everything was going as planned until about 20 minutes in. At this point, I was hearing a man speaking aggressively in French (much like Jacques Brel, but the voice sounded deeper). I'm not fluent in French, so whatever I was hearing is a mystery. The next day a similar thing happened after a nightmare except this time it sounded like a low-flying airplane was in my head. It was loud enough to scare me out of meditation and make my heart race. \n\nThe nightmares have been less frequent since then. I have, however, been experiencing more straightforward hallucinations. Every few hours or so, I'll see a humanoid figure in the corner of my eye. Like someone is behind me watching me. More recently I've also been seeing shadow-like figures running around right in front of me. The other night I was in my girlfriend's room watching a show with her when I noticed in the other corner of the room a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye. I couldn't focus on it enough to make out any features, but I did my best to make sure I really saw something. When I finally glanced over, it was gone. She knew something was up, as I seemed distracted (or maybe she sensed my terror) and asked me what was wrong. I just said I thought I saw something. \n\nI'm afraid to come forward about all of this to anyone in my everyday life. I'm afraid people may think there's something wrong with me. I just need someone to verify that this is normal with PTSD and not another mental illness. I'd also appreciate any anecdotes or advice. Thank you in advance. This has just been scary. I felt like I was doing well for so long.

When I was in middle school my older brother got into drugs and became a heroin addict shortly after. My mother would cry everyday and act coldly toward me and my little brother. She would go on fits of panic hyperventilating and pacing through our whole house and saying stuff like \u201cplease god just take my life instead of his\u201d. My dad would scream at my older brother horrible things and I don\u2019t blame him because my brother was horrible. He would steal things like my favorite video games and pawn them for drug money and I was too scared of upsetting my parents so I wouldn\u2019t tell them. I loved my brother so much I wanted to protect him even though he was ruining my life. I would find his burnt spoons and pills and just sob all night. I watched him but drugs from weird cars in front of our house when I\u2019d get home from school. Sometimes the drug cars would sit outside my house when I was home alone and I was so scared and confused. I would walk past his room and he would be sitting still with a blank expression staring at one corner of his room like a zombie. He actually overdosed and was dead until he was resuscitated in the ER. My parents would pay for different rehabs and they never worked. My parents were so upset about it they mostly ignored me and rarely let me leave the house. I felt so alone I would cut myself and make myself throw up or I would hysterically cry randomly at school or with friends. I wanted to just get in a car accident or find the courage to kill myself. I couldn\u2019t ever get help or tell my family because it would make the situation worse. All I wanted was for my mom to hug me and say everything was going to be okay. \n\nNow I\u2019m 19 and he\u2019s doing much better. He seems to be clean but you can never really be sure, but he seems much happier. But I am left with this scar that I don\u2019t think will ever go away. I fear drugs of any kind, I fear alcohol, I fear it all. Being around people doing those things make me panic on the inside. I do a good job usually of hiding it, but then I go home and cry. It\u2019s hard when everyone I know my age does all sorts of drugs and drinks. I\u2019ve lost friends, It\u2019s caused a breakup. I avoid movie scenes with drug use because it makes me that sick to my stomach and memes or people talking about drugs absolutely ruin my day. The thought of my boyfriend smoking or drinking still disturbs me greatly and makes me cry, but I don\u2019t want to control him. I know people use these things to find peace but I don\u2019t know why and it makes me so intensely upset. I wish I could protect everyone from these things but I can\u2019t. I know i sound crazy. I don\u2019t cry as much anymore. Sometimes the urge to hurt myself returns but I do well at suppressing that.

The things that happened after it were also bad. Talking to the police was bad (and ineffective). The person who did this is still doing it to other people and that\u2019s bad.

( i DIDNT THINK TO STOP HIM FROM LOCKING DOOR FML!!!) anyways it was like 1 minute i stopped calling his name and i was like oh shit oh shit i called his name no answer .. so i did that for about 20 seconds banging on door .. and then i could hear that breathing grasping for breathe noise ugh it was horrid i still hear it sometimes..  i could not get in with screw driver nothing.. my dumb ass took too long doing the wrong things to get in .. i got a hammer eventually and hit the doorknob out and could see him through the hole pale slunched over lifeless doing that breathing i cant even explain or recreate.. i ran in flipped his head back to see his face and was pale blue tongue out .. barely one breath left .. dragged him to floor and started doing mouth to mouth because at that point the breathing stopped ...while ambulance came ( he revived with narcan) .. ugh just the vision of him basically dead in my arms.. the fact that i almost failed many times, my friend who died same overdose years back could have been saved:((i wasnt there, would have tried my best) , the fact that this kid on this night could be gone right now , all the people who have died who could have been revived.. anyway my problem is this kid me and him are still friends now. but he has never talked about it or ignores if i say anything remotely to it , i guess to him everything seemed black, he didnt see what i saw so i understand why he isnt considerate towards my trauma and want to help me through it right\u00bf but maybe at same time he could be prideful or ashamed or depressed off of the situation so he wants to forget about it? either way ... these triggers wont go away.. the ptsd .. the me hearing anyone breathe weird in their sleep and i go into a panic and cant sleep in case someone \"stops breathing\" the sensitivity on the topic of oxys and fentanyl but everyones joking about them wanting to take them.. my favorite song was playing as this happened vok-before .. just little things everywhere trigger me and me still being friends with the person but never have gotten to talk about it or process it idk im just at a crossroad rn .."},{"id":"2230_ptsd","text":"Searching for a PTSD support group for my son who has no health insurance.

She had two children, a daughter my age and a son who was in middle\/high school. The daughter was my best friend at the time and the son was mentally challenged. He would lure me into his room by playing the \"Barbie Girl\" song by Aqua, I loved Barbies. The mother would always make him take me to the bathroom, even though I knew where it was. He would touch me and force me to touch him. I still remember how cramped the space was and how he would stand in the stall with me while I went to the bathroom. I still remember how hot his penis always was. The babysitting stopped when I came home one day and told my mom that he had shoved his tongue in my mouth\/down my throat. But neither of my parents knew the extent of the abuse until I was in middle school, half a state away.\n\nRecently, I've come to the age where I should be getting a regular physical. The thought of opening my legs to anyone, let alone my female doctor, horrifies me to an extent I've never been frightened before. Even before she could explain anything, I was in tears and shaking uncontrollably. The speculum looks like a weapon to me. Even the thought of being in a hospital gown scares me. She says that I don't need to have one, but I want to have children and getting a physical is the first step to understanding my full health spectrum. I'm in therapy because I couldn't go through with the physical, and I still haven't been able to do it one year later. She won't put me out for it and only offers me ibuprofen and xanax.\n\nLast night, even just thinking about the physical had me shaking and in tears. I curled up in a ball and closed my legs as tight as I could. Even now, typing this, I have my legs crossed tight. I think the son of my babysitter must have done more to me than just touching. I don't know how to cope with this. I'm still a virgin and have never had a real boyfriend. The last guy that tried to have sex with me was very insistent and I wasn't ready. He was disappointed and stopped talking to me when I pushed him away and accused him of only wanting me for sex. I want to have kids and I want to have sex, but I want to have them with someone I trust and love and who loves and trusts me back. I also have a horrible gag reflex and fear of blowjobs. I know that talking to my therapist is the best way to work through all of this but I have other issues that have taken precedence at the moment.

I could write a litany of things I adore about him but I won\u2019t subject the reddit community ;) Anyway he\u2019s been through some shit and I think only recently (a few yrs from retirement) has started to realize he may have some trauma related issues. We don\u2019t know if he has full blown ptsd or just some of the symptoms, but in my mind the label doesn\u2019t matter, what matters is that he (and I) are living things that I feel convinced are tied to the trauma he experienced. He\u2019s hesitant to get help or be diagnosed (not unwilling, just hesitant) because he\u2019s worried he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to keep working and he loves what he does, and of course the whole army mental health stigma thing. You know the drill. \n\nAnd I get it.\n\nBut we\u2019re already trying to navigate a long distance relationship, and when he\u2019s not doing well he goes through periods where he shuts down and shuts me (and everyone) out suddenly and for indefinite periods of time.\n\nThat\u2019s happening right now. And the thing is, I know I\u2019m just going to have to wait for him to resurface, there\u2019s really no other choice. I have almost only compassion and love for him, and while I feel upset and hurt on a personal level, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s about me \u2014 in fact I know it\u2019s not. I just want to be able to be there to support and love on him, and I don\u2019t want him to feel like a burden or a failure (got this from him, not my assumption). He\u2019s been infinitely patient and compassionate with my anxiety issues that would have thrown any guy for a loop, so I want to be able to do the same for him. It hurts when I can\u2019t.\n\nBut I just don\u2019t know how to handle these situations. Of course my anxiety and emotions go haywire when I just get shut out and don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll next hear from him.\n\nSo I guess I need insight. He\u2019s not telling me what he needs from me right now, or anything for that matter. I don\u2019t know what helps or hurts. The first week I was pretty persistent trying to get through, but then eventually realized it was no good. This past week (second week) I\u2019ve periodically reached out or tried to call, still to no effect. I\u2019ve tried to stay gentle in my messages and say that I love him and am here etc but just need to hear something from him. But he\u2019s not even opening messages and I have a hunch he\u2019s leaving his phone off now.\n\nMy best guess is that he\u2019s getting messages from a lot of family and loved ones and can\u2019t bear to answer or have to constantly ignore notifications. Which would mean he\u2019s really not in a good place. He\u2019s such a gentle and loving soul so I know it gives him pain to shut people he loves out, which tells me his overwhelm and\/or depression is even more painful.\n\nSo I have only been able to respond to what I feel in determining how and whether to reach out. Not his needs since I don\u2019t know what they are. And so I don\u2019t know, does being persistent help or make it worse, or does it have no effect at all? I don\u2019t mean eight messages or calls a day. I never sent more than about two a day and now it\u2019s only every few days. I don\u2019t want to leave him isolated but I don\u2019t want to pile on more guilt that will push him deeper into a shutdown. And I\u2019m losing my mind not hearing from him. I miss him badly so it\u2019s pretty hard not to make efforts at contact in hopes of finally getting through. Last time this happened I just let him do his thing and waited for him to reach out, and it was almost a month before I heard from him. I don\u2019t think I can bear to do that again.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do.\n\nAnd yes, therapy is on the table and will be a discussion, but I just need insight on how best to deal right now. Or is there no definite answer and I\u2019m just gonna have to weather the suckiness of not knowing until he finally makes contact and I can ask him directly?\n\nI hate this \ud83d\ude16"},{"id":"2243_ptsd","text":"Did anyone else try to draw their trauma and get told by their clinician they were not allowed to draw acts of their trauma, but only positive things?

She would hit me for breathing too loud, monitoring everything I did, she joined my bullies at school, she told me everyday I was shit, pathetic and nothing. She ground me down, and every time I see her, I feel total rage and want to scream. I have only been actively triggered by her a few times, and the rest of the time I just get this blind anger and rage when I see something I know she likes (animated Disney movies, Halloween, certain candy brands, etc).\n\nI got sexually assaulted and would relive it in my dreams. I could never see his face, and I still can\u2019t remember it, but I remember his hands. Regularly relived this for about 3 years after it happened, then it stopped. This wasn\u2019t a rape. It was all hands. I always thought it was mild but the effect it has on me for years after Wasn\u2019t mild. \n\nI came out as trans (unrelated to anything else, but being a closeted trans kid wasn\u2019t fun in itself) and I lost friends. A lot of bad stuff went down, fed into stuff from my sister...I don\u2019t want to go into detail, but the world became terrifying and far more dangerous over night, and I lost so many people I loved and I blamed myself for it. I still relive this stuff today.\n\n I tried to kill myself, mostly due to my life falling apart, anxiety and not being able to deal with whatever this is, whether it is ptsd or something else. I messed it up, thought about what my parents would think, and went for help at my local ER. They took me and locked me on a ward and wouldn\u2019t let me leave. I still can\u2019t go into hospitals and I have attacks whIch feel just like I did when they took me in. I can get set off now by seeing people being imprisoned on tv.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking is, are these things and my responses to them typical of ptsd? I know I should be asking a doctor but honestly, I can\u2019t do it. I would rather die than go back to a hospital.

Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or \"go see a therapist\" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.\n\nOkay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating\/introspecting\/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.\n\nEither way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.\n\nIn particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.\n\nThere is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable\/offensive that the pain\/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure\/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental\/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears\/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and\/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences\/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas\/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers"},{"id":"2265_incel","text":" I guess that's almost a relief.

I meet so many beautiful people who can't see their beauty. Is there something getting in the way for you? Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? If so, this can be addressed first. Sometimes stories are told about us when we're young and the best thing we can do is see the author's evil or careless intent and not take that on. A therapist can help you with this part.Once you've addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. First, your thoughts. If you keep telling yourself that you don't like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. Experiment with telling yourself something different. Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something that's lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You can't change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important. Without going to plastic surgery (the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become), you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. Accepting yourself and knowing it won't change is a good idea, because wishing it were different won't make it so!Looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets. Are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup? Ask a good friend to give you a make-over. Play with your features and wardrobe.

I've been attending a four-year university four hours away from my hometown, so i've been staying in the dorms up there and trying to soak up that \"traditional college experience.\" Truth is, I really hate it. I was diagnosed with PTSD at the end of 2018, alongside depression and anxiety. My trauma happened in February of 2018, so it is pretty fresh and still hurts. It's terrible timing that I also had to go off to college for the first time a couple of months after. My hyper vigilance intensifies when I am at my college. I don't feel safe at all, but I've been toughing it out for 2 semesters to see if I still like it and get acclimated. I like the school and it's objectively a good school to attend, but don't know if it's the best option for me right now. It has a few cool things that I like (great academics for my major, amazing recreation center and yoga) but it all boils down to my PTSD. \n\nMy other option is a school 20 minutes away from my home, and commuting there because  I feel safer staying at my house. I'm kind of upset about leaving the \"Traditional college experience\" behind but then again it's for my mental health, and i really didn't like it anyways. I'm not into partying, drinking, sports, or greek life, so it was hard for to meet people since my school is big on those things. I'm anxious i won't make friends as easily at the commuter school, but i also don't have many friends currently at the university that I am attending. I've had my first long break since the summer before senior year and it's the best I've felt in a while, since I've been away from the university and am now getting anxious about returning next week.

I hope some well agree disagree and some will give me more advice then what I have. One thing I learned from my mindset is to stop or to never engage in the victim mindset. Meaning what is done is done, dwell on it for a few I agree your a human being.  but to fond and to idolize what was done or what happened has been always a no no.  I learned that I couldn\u2019t control people or their actions I was a kid but I couldn\u2019t control people. It\u2019s not your fault don\u2019t blame yourself.( I can sit here and say what happened but I\u2019m not.) because one it\u2019s done with nothing can honestly change it, and 2 the goal with this is to idolize yourself and to help you get on the Road of recovery.\nVices, Pride and Ego\n All these things cooked me.

Forgive but forgive for yourself, forgive yourself what happened the person and whatever occurred. \nDon\u2019t fall into a victim mindset it\u2019s okay we all go through troubles in life some worse then others and some not as much. We all take things differently but never idolize the trauma, idolize yourself  because when you idolize the trauma the negative cycle of thoughts begins. \n\nPs- I hope I didn\u2019t offend anyone or hurt anyone, i just wanted to tell my mindset and how I felt with ptsd and how I still live with it."},{"id":"2275_ptsd","text":"Vision Boards for those of us with PTSD In 2016, I was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

I was like \u201cwtf,\u201d is this even voluntary? Turns out it is. I could have stayed home and continued trying to fix myself. I completed a trauma level 1 program and opted to go the intensive route by completing the next step the right way. I have to be away from everyone and can\u2019t have electronics. I will miss you, Reddit! \nI finished the program I was in with many women who are vets or have husbands serving. I think this was the key for me to really accept my PTSD. I didn\u2019t fully absorb it before seeing these women react to situations and explain their emotions the way I did. We\u2019re not crazy. We aren\u2019t \u201coverly emotional.\u201d You give an asthmatic an inhaler for a reason. You give someone with severe, chronic PTSD skills to avoid panic attacks, flashbacks and nightmares for the same reason; in that regard, its all the same. Trauma itself is much like pain: you can\u2019t compare it. It is what it is. When you\u2019re stuck in fight or flight mode, you need to learn skills to turn it off. This is through DBT. I have been panic attack free for awhile now, have not had self harming thoughts, or any other \u201ccrazy\u201d feeling that could potentially occur due to PTSD. It\u2019s all brain damage.\nMost trauma treatment is voluntary, and you need to find them on your own. I highly recommend each of you find a psychologist- not a \u201ctherapist\u201d to treat PTSD. My trauma occurred in my childhood. My psychologist now treats adults, but many of us were abused as children. His background is working with dyfus cases and treating children. Get a good psychiatrist you can trust- I am on 6 medications: 2 for nightmares and sleep, 2 for anxiety, and 2 for depression. NO ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDS BECAUSE IM NOT CRAZY.\nPTSD is brain damage, and that\u2019s how it needs to be treated.\nI\u2019m extremely mistrusting of the system and had to do this all my way. My husband is a great support, and I know many of you don\u2019t have the support you need. I\u2019m praying for you.\nI hit the lottery when I found my psychologist. He wanted me to face my trauma last year by doing this, and I couldn\u2019t because I knew i wasn\u2019t ready. 2 years after starting therapy, I had the courage to do this.\nMy point is; no matter what state or insurance you have, it\u2019s your responsibility to take care of your mental health to the best of your ability and capacity. \nI wish you all the best as I say bye to Reddit and begin the next chapter in my journey. Going to the west coast VOLUNTARILY so I can leave behind some mistrust, anger, and worry and do what I need to do the right way - no visitors, no contact 30 days.

I ran out of money about 2 months in as work safe hadn't started sending me cheques yet so I tried to go back to work.

You are all so strong and amazing and I don\u2019t think I could have survived or functioned through even half of the stuff you guys have.\n\nThe reason I have PTSD is because I experienced loss and change and ups and downs very quickly and simultaneously all at once and I think the whiplash is getting me. But, mostly, I was in a very toxic job and I had two bosses that just sucked the life out of me. They teased me for having anxiety and tried to ruin my chances of ever being hired anywhere else. They were controlling and condescending and two faced and I got to a point where I could barely walk in the work building without thinking I was having a heart attack.\n\nI\u2019m finally out of that job and on to better things, but the PTSD still gets me.

Any comment from you guys will be very appreciated! \n\nSo I recently broke up with my girlfriend over a big fight. It wasn\u2019t the first time we had a fight like this and every-time we get into an argument she tends to get very defensive and start attacking me. She gets into this rage of cursing me out loud regardless of where we are or who we are with and goes on for 30 minutes. In the beginning of the relationship, I thought this to be more nothing more than anger management and her personality. She tends to be very aggressive with her words and starts attacking the other person when she feels like she gets taken advantage of. There are a few restaurants that Im still ashamed to go because my ex and I caused a very unpleasant scene. I mean everyone gets like that when they get mad but it was way too extreme. She had so much hatred and negativity against certain type of people and would even mention of hurting the others at extreme.\n\nAfter the breakup, I had some time to catch up with a friend. We were just having a couple of drinks just chatting and the word \u201cPTSD\u201d was brought up. And this word instantly hit me so hard... I mean folks I never experienced it and never thought I would meet anyone who had it. But deep inside me I knew my ex was going through PTSD. \n\nOne of the symptoms she had was nightmare. She never shared her nightmare with me except for once and I never insisted on her telling me since it always put her in a bad mood. But that time she told me, it\u2019s someone trying to attack her and she cant seem to do anything about it..... The other physical symptoms she had (at least thats what I think) were her migraines. She was very sensitive to noises. She would scream in th middle of the night and scared the shit out of me. She also would jerk her leg at night saying it hurts and would not be able to go to sleep. She told me she has a bad memory. All of this indicate that she has PTSD but I was oblivious to the symptoms.  Now that I have learned this, I only have regrets of not being more understanding and guiding her in th right direction. Although I have to admit that I was very exhausted from this relationship I cant deny the fact that I still love her and care for her.    Im willing to put myself in her shoes even if that means I take away just a little of the pain she goes through.\n\nFolks, I would love to hear some of you guys go through. Obviously talking about symptoms is not pleasant but if anyone is willing to share what they have to go through it will be much appreciated.\n\nThanks"},{"id":"2327_ptsd","text":"Can people sense your fear?

I was pacing and out of focus and trying to work through it, and I told him that's what was on my mind.\n\nHe continually asked if I was okay, but would interrupt me if I spoke with asking, that was the first sign he really wasn't paying attention (I didn't want extra attention but in case something happened he would at least know which trauma it related to). He then proposed to help me, I said I didn't think there was anything he could do at this moment, and he replied with \"We could have sex, that takes your mind off things!\" \n\nI was shocked, but also so deep in my mind I didn't react right away. He assumed I did not hear him, so he suggested it again, and I told him now isn't the time. He then started playfully grabbing me and saying he was going to make me feel good, asking for sex, and I was IMMEDIATELY covered in this layer of disgust and discomfort, I felt like gagging.

He gave me a hug, and squeezed me super tight, which made me yell STOP, and rush out the door. \n\nI have barely spoken to him, and I did get the courage to tell him (through text unfortunately) exactly what happened. He apologized profusely, admitted he should have paid more attention, etc.\n\nBut now my issue is, I feel gross even if he messages me. I haven't been able to respond to him. He keeps telling me about his days and then ending with \"oh sorry, I always make it about me,\" and I know him well enough to know he is not intending that statement in a passive aggressive manner, that's just his way of saying he feels he made another mistake through a text.\n\nI feel so guilty because every strong feeling I had for him immediately vanished, I don't want to hurt him, and (selfishly) I don't want to be so alone again.

(ptsd\/911-WTC) I took all Sunday morning to write a blog post, something I've been meaning to write for a while. Needs work, could be more poetic, but I shared it with my family, and I didn't get a good response. My father was \"I don't get it. Maybe you need to share this with your support group\". Ok, that's fine. However my \"dead\" sister called my mother, said it was psychotic and I should be locked up. Really, really upsetting. So anyway, I don't have know where else I can put this that they won't find, not Facebook of course. Here it is: \"Is my sister alive or dead, or does it matter?\"\n\n\"Unlike Schrodinger's cat, we usually think we know whether somebody we know is either alive or dead. But in some rare cases, the truth isn't binary but some alternate \"other\" solution.\n\nIn the 90's, my older sister lived and worked in the World Trade Center complex. She was there for the 1993 bombing, even felt it. She worked in the high-pressure world of international finance. She would work 12-hour days 7 days a week and said she had to do so just to get ahead. I was proud of her. She seemed to be doing something s she enjoyed. She would smile, laugh, and would seem to have a good time.\n\nThen 9\/11 happened. I remember where I was, so do you. I called my mother that day and she confirmed that my sister had been in California all day. She had relocated and was longer based off the east coast, so she survived, right? No\/yes. The few times I saw her after that she was always deadly serious, never smiled (fake smiles though). She had once done track and field and had been in excellent shape, but now she looked like a concentration camp survivor. Her upper-body is way too thin.\n\nIt all came to a head 5 years ago when I found a small card holder that had her business card showing her name and address at 3 World Financial Center. I cried so much when I saw it. I went around and gave them out to random people telling them that they were my sister's and she died that day. It was a higher truth vs. she wasn't there and was just fine. Hence my paradox.\n\nShe was must have been affected much more than she knew or was aware of. She lost her workplace, co-workers, a place she called home. I saw the pain when she mentioned it to me just that once. Perhaps it's a type of survivor's guilt because it can go either way. That you're super grateful that you're alive and want to share what you have with everyone, or that you don't feel like you were one of the lucky ones. It's probably something she just stuffed. Who knows.\n\nBut again, is my sister a survivor of 9\/11 or a victim? I think she was missed in count of the walking wounded, until today.\"\n\nBTW: This is the 3rd place I've posted this, still looking for some feedback.  I have some very serious PTSD from other things, but crap doesn't everybody in their own way, even if they only watched it happen, also have some PTSD related to 9\/11?

This is my first post and and would like to know your opinion. What do you think of my situation? What would you do?  \n\nIam 24 years old and for more than a decade iam suffering. My current situation is really difficult. This year i wanted to go to university again, but my medical condition is a living hell. My problem is my body is 24\/7 in an \"emergency situation\". That means it feels to me like my own body is a prison\/enemy to me. I can barely breathe, i dont sleep well (for years) and my stomach is so hard to the point i feel emotionless. It feels to me this is taking 80% of my energy. Over the year  \"being depressed\" became the new normal for me.\n\nThe relationship to my parents is really difficult. I experienced a lot of abuses. Want some examples?\n- At age 7 i was trying to sleep in a room with my brother in the evening. I was scared of \"monsters\" under the bed, so i asked my little brother if he could come to sleep beside me (children), so i dont need to be scared anymore. A few moments later my fundamental religious father came into the room, took the blanket away and throw me aggresively to the ground. Then he started to beat my little childrens body with his foot. My stomach hurt was hit by his foot. 1 Minute later my mum came to him, but she just observed and didnt do anything. Then it began to hurt so much, i was thinking i would die. So i crawled on my knees to my mothers feet and told her  \"mommy please tell him to stop\". But he kept going by this time punching me in the face, so blood came out of my nose. As he noticed the blood, he grabbed me by my t-shirt and pulled me like a dog to the bathroom, where he forced me to wash my blood. I was so little i couldnt reach the water so he gave me something to stand above. While cleaning the blood i was crying and most importantly my body was vibrating enormously.\n\n- At age 8 i should take my little brother to play with my friend outdoors. Like most children i wanted to play with my own friends and don't want to ( Alone the fact letting a 5years and 8 years old playing for several hours alone on the street is crazy). Then my father saw me coming down the street and asked where i was, i said \"i was on the playground\". As he knew i didnt take my brother with me, he was so aggressive i got scared of him. I literally was so scared i began to run away from him. I ran the street down and now comes the crazy thing. He began to run wild after me and i screamed as loud as a i could \"HELP\", but nobody noticed. As i couldnt run anymore, i instinctively put my hands before my face, in fear he would punch me in the face. \n\n-At Age 6 i behave badly in the opinion of my parents and they scared to beat me, so i left the building block and waited infront of the bus stop for several hours in the cold. I Brief the whole time and each time a bus come by (every 20 minutes) i started to control it, so no stranger noticed me. Every two minutes i looked to the door, to look if they let me in again.\n\n- At age 16 i was really hungry and cooked a little meal for myself. My father told me i should share it with my brother. I told him no, there is enough left he can cook for himself, he is old enough. He was so angry he took my plate with the food on it and threw it in front of me into the garbage. Then he became more aggressive and and destroyed the plate with a spoon in front my eyes and forced me to clean everything up. At this time school already was really hard for me emotional, so i cried silently desperate while cleaning everything.\n\n- One day at age 15 or so he came in a aggressive mood in my childrens room ( dont remember why), we had a discussion and then began to threat me by coming really near to me, holding his fingers between his teeths saying \"iam craazy\"."},{"id":"2370_counseling","text":"he just walks in the house whenever he wants to see his kids.

I have personally noticed that I seem to display a worrying number of characteristics of PTSD. I am making an appointment with my psychiatrist to discuss these and whatever significance they may have. I just want to vent\/ramble\/rant. **TW: domestic violence, substance abuse**)\n\nI had a sudden epiphany a few days ago, and it's shaken how I view myself and what I thought I knew about myself pretty deeply. I have pretty severe depression, and I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists (and been in psych hospitals occasionally) for years and years from that. I always considered myself well informed on what symptoms of mental illnesses were, that I was a strong enough person to be truthful to myself, that I've discovered all of my symptoms and there are no other issues to find. I think(fear?) I was wrong on those accounts. \n\nI've always thought that I could never have PTSD because all of the trauma I could think of (stuff related to severe bullying mostly) didn't elicit even any real discomfort from recalling them. I thought I was being truthful to myself that I had no other traumas to think of, and definitely no triggers, flashbacks, or avoidance. I always was dismissive of the *other* (what i now realize is) trauma. That was just me being hysterical and dramatic over nothing. \n\nNope. A few nights ago, my mother's abuser(and long term off and on boyfriend) came to the house. They got into a mild shouting argument. Mildly unpleasant to listen to, but no huge deal, right? No. I hear the shouting and I'm suddenly, totally, and illogically overcome with fear. Overwhelming terror, confusion, anger, and most of all feeling powerless to do anything. I crawled under my blankets in bed to try and calm down. I started being in my bedroom as a little kid, hearing them fighting late at night through my bedroom door. I wanted to not hear them but they shouted so loud, and my door was thin. The threats. The sounds of objects being thrown. The death threats. The assault. The screaming. Wondering if he is really going to kill her. The crying. Wondering if we had to sleep at Grandma's again. \n\nAnd then I'm just left with the fear and the powerlessness. Crying in my bed. This happens sometimes, I tell myself. I'm just not good with hearing fights, its nothing. I took a hit of a drug I probably use to cope. It helped me calm down enough to type out something to my friend. About an hour or so later, I reread what I wrote happened. It suddenly hits me that this sounds really, really problematic. Like, this is not a normal response to that kind of situation, and that was really specific and realistic remembering. Then \"wait, this is always the same when I hear fighting, the same memory and emotional overwhelm. Wait. What? How long has this happened? ...Ever since that night? And its always the same? Even when he abused her for years after that with me being witness to most of it?\" \n\nAnd then the floodgates started to open. \n\n*  \"Oh god, every time I see him or things or smells associated with him I get viscerally uncomfortable\"      \n* \"Oh god, simply hearing his voice wakes me up from a sound sleep. Always.\"      \n* \"I have been avoiding seeing him at all costs for years, and I hide in my room whenever he is even near me. All two of the physical fights I have been in, have been with him when he was in the house and I snapped after he wouldn't leave despite me begging mom to have him leave\"      \n* \"What are the other symptoms of ptsd? (googles) ... disturbed sleep? ...\" (i am a violent sleeper. i dont put sheets on anymore as they 100% always are ripped off as i thrash in my sleep\"     \n* \"and... shouting in your sleep? ......\" (no conscious memory, but apparently every night i shout out things. my mom doesnt mention it much anymore unless it was a bad night, but whenever i share a hotel with someone I wake up to \"why were you shouting \"stop go away stop\" at 3 AM?\")           \n* \"what else cou- nightmares too?\" (never related to trauma in a way i can discern, but have nightmares that wake me up screaming in about 1\/3 sleeps)             \n* \"exaggerated startle response? Does that mean what I think? ... Yes. ... fuck...\" (its not quite as severe anymore but i used to invariably freak out if someone touched me without me seeing it. My dad(never hit me, never abused me, was the chill parent) used to poke me in the car at random, just jokingly. I would flinch and recoil every time. Eventually I got to a point where I would sit pushed against the passenger side door to try and get away from it. He asked me at the time why I flinched and got scared, he never hit me. I didnt know why I did that but I couldnt stop. Now I dont do well with people touching me at random, surprising noises, loud bangs, sirens and fire alarms)   \n\nIt was like I was looking at a connect the dots, and the dots were all in a straight line in numerical order. I got deeply confused. Why hadn't I ever talked to my psychiatrists about this? Why didn't I realize I have flashbacks weekly or more? Why didn't I realize hearing aggressive shouting is very prone to do this, even from strangers in public, or in film\/tv? Why didn't I realize my reaction to the memory or presence of my moms abuser far exceeds what is normal? Why did I not connect my hatred of his face, Heineken, the smell of spilled beer, or his cologne with this? How did I never admit this? Any of this? Why did I always deny I had trauma issues or dodge the question so deftly, all the while completely unconscious of what I was dodging? What the fuck do I do now? \n\nI feel like I wasn't hurt badly enough. I wasn't the direct target of any of his violence until I was an adult. It wasn't sexual or combat related. It didn't ruin my life(depression did that for me) like my friend, who I knew disassociates for hours and wakes up multiple times nightly from the nightmares. I feel guilty for even considering it, but I detect too many characteristics that line up for me to ignore it. I'm making an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for the first time in my life. I've been seeing psychiatrists for 9 years by now and I've never done this. \n\nMy sense of self and my understanding of my mental health has been destroyed. I feel like I was assembling a jigsaw puzzle of myself, was mostly done, and perhaps 40% of the puzzle just got torn off, mixed up, and the pieces thrown across the floor. I've always felt that if nothing else, I knew what happens to my brain. I thought it has been the same for years now. That there wasn't more to discover, just need to work more therapy and cope better. But there's been a giant red neon sign saying \"THESE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS YOU DOLT\" here the whole time and I've been blind to it. What else could I have missed? How deep does this trauma stuff run? How am I supposed to self evaluate when I can apparently never be objective about these things? What use is talking about ones symptoms if I managed to perfectly lie to myself and to my doctors and therapists for all of these years?\n\nIt's so plainly obvious, I think I must have subconsciously been refusing to accept it. To protect.. something. That's why I think I was able to take off the blinders about this when I was uninhibited through the drugs I took to calm down. Its my only thought I've managed to come up with regarding why I never saw the plainly obvious truth, and instead unconsciously denied and avoided, with expert skill, connecting the symptoms to trauma. Even the flashbacks. I always just thought I was being dramatic and emotional. I never had a thought about them beyond \"oh just ignore it\". Even though I knew what PTSD commonly presents as. Even though I didn't think I was hiding anything or that I would hide anything like this. \n\nI'm talking to my psychiatrist soon. I don't look forward to it at all. I have a feeling it will be awful trying to say any of this. I don't even know what's next. I am not able to reduce my exposure to my triggers. I can't control him. My mom thinks I should like him and has never understood how upset I get. Even when I (of all people, never hurt a fly, never wanted to fight anyone, ever) have been so upset by his presence, combined with hearing his inescapable voice in my bedroom, that I attacked him. Two different times. I can't even type this post without crying from this. Talking. Ugh. :(\n\nSorry for this huge wall of text. I'm just. My brain feels like scrambled eggs. So many questions. Feel so lost about who\/what I am as a person and what my mental illness means and how they affect me. It's seemingly all gone out the window and I'm put back at the start.

It was like 7:30pm, and it was pitch black because it was winter. I got out of school late because we had an open evening after school. This one is a bit more intense. As i said, there were guys lingering in an alleyway, and they had the smell of alcohol on them. I hadn\u2019t even realised they were there, but they grabbed me by the hair off the high street, pulled me into the alleyway and made me suck their dicks, forcing my head onto them and choking me until i threw up and almost fainted. \n\nA couple weeks ago, after christmas, i was in london and was gangraped in a freezing park and impregnated. I had it aborted like a week ago but that still sucks. And that wasn\u2019t the first abortion that i had to have. When i was 9, i was abducted and impregnated. That kid was also aborted. Literally two nights ago, we were at my mom\u2019s friend\u2019s dinner party and stayed the night. One of the guests crept into my room and raped me all night and i pretended to be asleep.

At the time of diagnosis, things in my life were going great. I had decided to try Art Therapy to tap into my own creativity and learn some new techniques. At the very first meeting, the therapist asked me simple questions that started to unnerve me.\n\n\u201cDo you sit facing doors and windows?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cLook at where you are sitting.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cIf that window behind you was a door, would you have sat there?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not.

This is what I associated with PTSD, at the time. My Art Therapist explained that PTSD can happen when the brain feels extremely unsafe. The situations vary with each person and their age at the time of the event.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since I was diagnosed and I\u2019ve met so many people who also live with PTSD.

Moderators, if this post is at all hurtful it is completely unintentional and I would want you to take it down. I have never started a conversation here before and in no way want to hurt or offend. Here goes... I am diagnosed with PTSD from a violent rape 15 years ago. After many miserable years of escalating symptoms I have been in therapy for 3.5 years. My flashbacks and visceral feelings have been under control for a couple of years until today. I don\u2019t know what it is about the verdict but I feel incredibly out of body at the moment. I feel weak and have had multiple crying jags since getting home from work. I\u2019m a teacher so it was brave face and bury it all day until I could get home. Without getting to much into it, I feel so let down and ANGRY. It feels like how my life used to be on the daily and I just have to get through this evening.

Hello humans, \n\nBelow is a non-graphic summary of my current predicament and I was hoping to gain some advice!\n\nI work in the live production world in general - concert\/theatrical touring shows specifically - and I am 26 years old. This interest of mine began in high school when I had the opportunity to participate in our school's theater program for which I built sets, hung lights, and operated audio. This was also my first co-ed experience as from age 4 to 18 I went to an all girls school. To put on theater productions, however, we would work with the all boys school across the street. While I did well in theater back then, I was often ignored by the other students and teachers as they all came from the boys school and weren't sure how to interact with me... I think. Even when I became a vital participant in making productions happen, I kept to myself because I was also put off by the social dynamic of the boys.\n\nI pursued this in New York City where I went to college during which time being the only woman on a production crew was also the norm. In 2013 and 2015 respectively I had a violent experience as it pertained to men wanting access to my body. The earlier was while working at a music festival, the later was during an off campus Black Student Union event. At those times I was eager to put those experiences behind me and forget about it however still fell into a sort of social anxiety\/paranoia from 2015-2017 at which point I left New York City taking the freelancing rhythm of my life on the road. I was based out of Maryland that summer yet traveled to festivals all over the country for the job I had. Then I spent the next several months out in Virginia where I attended a great church with a female pastor and a congregation that consisted of about twenty women and two men. The community there was a big catalyst for me pulling myself back together.\n\nAfter that I applied for and accepted my first permanent job in a management position at a concert venue in Washington DC but in the eight months I was there received progressively unnerving approaches from one of the male staff members. That compounded with my desire to get back on the road touring prompted me to quit. On top of all that, working with the same large group of men day to day made me more paranoid than working with men in passing on my typical 1-3 month gigs. However I assumed that it might've just been a symptom of the overall environment of that workplace.\n\nCurrently I am on my longest tour yet: an 11 month contract that began in July 2019. By this point I noticed the overwhelming pattern that I am only able to feel relaxed around women. I'm responsible for all the logistics of the tour unit. I'm the one who dictates who rides in each car and who is where on each bus. For all of these I've made it so I'm only with women whether that be in a car or in a certain area of the bus. However my fellow managers are men and recently I was forced to change the car assignments due to a change in our overall production schedule. Because of this I share an office with them in each arena or theater we go to. The crew, as per usual, is also mostly men. While things were mostly fine from July-November, since December I've been developing a growing sense of anxiety around my coworkers for seemingly no good reason. This culminated two weeks ago with me having a panic attack from sitting between two of them on a four hour plane ride during which they were asleep most of the time which resulted in lots of accidental physical contact and being breathed on.\n\nI've been averse to physical contact my whole life but since college it evolved into more of an acute fear. Because of this I modified my wardrobe so that everything but my face and hands was covered at all times creating a bit of a buffer or even a deterrent.\n\nMy main frustration now is that these men are not doing anything. They are of no threat to me. Yet my body is reacting as if they were constantly. Due to the nature of my job I'm practically living with these people. Because of all this I'm searching for methods or strategies to make these feelings stop.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated!"},{"id":"2404_ptsd","text":"Hypersensitive to touch\/burning sensation Ok so my PTSD stems from childhood specifically sexual abuse.

We do not understand what is going on, and it is driving us crazy."},{"id":"2406_ptsd","text":"Jekyll and Hyde I\u2019ve been in a relationship with an incredibly kind, funny and wonderful man for almost 4 years. He has ptsd and agoraphobia, mostly untreated for the majority of our time together. I finally convinced him to get some counseling maybe 6 months ago, and now he talks to a nice woman in the phone once a week, who seems helpful, and he has made some great strides recently in getting out more.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a large pile of issues between the agoraphobia and the ptsd, but what I\u2019m curious about today is the personality shift that tends to happen when he gets triggered and depersonalizes\/derealizes. It starts with visible agitation and anxiety, which quickly progresses to becoming argumentative and aggressive and eventually be completely unable to listen to logic or follow any train of thought, mine or his. I spent years trying to talk things over or find any way to pacify him in those moments, but I generally found that once I realized what was happening, he was too far gone and too far into victim mode, and any words that came out of my mouth would just end up getting twisted and make things worse. \n\nOf course, one of his big triggers is abandonment issues, so as soon as I start to realize that he\u2019s in that place and try to extricate myself from the situation, it tends to escalate things. My latest \u201csolution\u201d has been to just freeze and go comatose while he rages at me and calls me an asshole for ignoring his pain, and wait for him to get some sleep. It almost always happens late at night when he\u2019s overtired, and the only reset button tends to be sleep. Yes, sometimes this is made worse by alcohol but it\u2019s also been known to happen when he\u2019s dead sober. When he wakes up in the morning he can usually barely remember what has happened, is absolutely horrified at the way he\u2019s made me feel, and completely wracked with guilt. I\u2019m always incredibly upset and angry the next day, when it feels safe to do so, but it generally fades throughout the day as it feels useless to be angry at someone who isn\u2019t there anymore and who is punishing himself far more than I could.\n\nHe is the biggest, sweetest puppy dog, the type of guy who will spend a few minutes investigating each log before putting it into the fire to make sure no bugs will be burnt alive. Animals love him. I have never met someone more kind, more attuned to my needs and understanding of my feelings. He has the most healing hands, he can take away the most debilitating pain with a simple head massage (I get the type of menstrual cramps that leave me screaming and throwing up on the bathroom floor).\n\nAnd yet - every now and then he leaves and in his place there is a man who is my nightmare. I know that at this point I have my own trauma to deal with from these nights. He\u2019s never hurt me and I\u2019m generally not physically frightened, but he has punched a few holes in the wall and there have been bad nights where he uses his size (we have a 14-inch, 100-lb difference) to try and stop me from leaving his house, towering over me and getting obvious pleasure from intimidating me, physically holding my car door closed so I cannot leave, or getting into my car with me and refusing to get out.\n\nI feel stupid as I write this, I feel like every stereotype of a girl blinded by love. \n\nMaybe I just needed to vent, or see this all written out. But I am still so curious about how, if possible, I can derail nights like these. He claims that all he needs is hugs. Sometimes I\u2019m able to push past all of my feelings of wanting to stay away and try to squeeze the bad out of him. Sometimes it works for a second, but it\u2019s never long before he turns on me again and accuses me of god knows what. It\u2019s so hard to keep track of reality and not get pulled down the rabbit hole of incoherent thought on nights like that. \n\nHas anyone out there experienced issues like this, on either end, and found anything in the moment that\u2019s been able to snap them out of it? It happened a couple nights ago and it was the first time I\u2019ve encountered that side of him in many months, so I have hope that therapy is working and that things are on the upswing. But in the meantime, I\u2019d be so grateful for any insight into anything helpful someone in my position can do. I saw a therapist for a while but she mostly just wanted to talk about my personal issues (I\u2019ve been battling chronic depression for most of my life) and never seemed to want to touch much on the subject of how to help the person who affects my life the most.\n\nSorry this is such a rant, and thanks to anyone who managed to read this far."},{"id":"2407_counseling","text":"I've been with my partner for 4 years.

(Sorry if this is scattered thoughts bundled together) Long story short\u2014 I had a car accident about 8 months ago. I had to be airlifted. I only remember hearing the sounds of the helicopter and I don\u2019t remember anything beyond that besides waking up in a hospital with a tube down my throat begging for water that I couldn\u2019t drink for 3 days. I arrived to the hospital with just enough blood to be breathing still. I fractured my pelvis, broke my ankle on the opposite side of my body, and broke my elbow on the the same side of my fractured pelvis. I couldn\u2019t walk for 3 months and I was in a retirement\/ rehabilitation facility for 3 weeks after being in ICU for 2 weeks after my accident where the \u201cnurses\u201d and doctors there had never dealt with someone as young as me. It was hell in there and finally I was able to go home and be bed bound then wheelchair accessible then  I began to walk again after a lot of physical therapy~October, my accident was early July. Well I felt like those times there was so many crazy things going on it hasn\u2019t been until now where Im returning to a somewhat normal lifestyle (attempting at least) where Ive started to go through what I can only describe as panic attacks, insomnia, and nightmares. The panic attacks started about a month ago. And just simply thinking about being job less and just how different my life has changed to what it is now causes a huge influx of negative thoughts and I just dont want to leave the house and deal with life. I dont feel like Im myself anymore like the old me died in that accident. I wanted to get out of my bed for so long when I was bed bound that now I recluse in it because of the anxiety. I am currently taking pain pills a much lesser dose then I started with.

I feel like they never liked me, my mom and dad were so so mean to me. At least that\u2019s how it felt to me. My parents had me when they were very young. My dad was a drug dealer and my mom was fifteen. I was a premature baby and since my parents were kids, my grandmother (my moms mother) was practically raising me a lot of the time. But my parents resented me for something they allowed to happen. They tried to make it so I couldn\u2019t see her but when they wanted to go out well they would stop saying that. I would always get caught in the middle of their fights, glasses getting thrown, some even hit me, getting knocked over, getting screamed at for being in the room when they were fighting. And then it got worse. Whenever I tried to Hug my parents they\u2019d either tell me to go away or they\u2019d ask me what I wanted and push me out of the way. They\u2019d tell me they never wanted me. They got older and when I was seven had another kid. And overtime three more. My parents stopped with the non legal stuff but they still constantly had their issues with each other, and whenever they didn\u2019t get along they would take it out on me. I was grounded for months at a time for no reason, everything taken out of my room. Sometimes even locked in. And I was a pretty good child. I was just really sad. Just wanted a family. In middle school I tried really hard to get away. I went to the police and showed them the bruises told them of the horror I was living, but since I was in an upper class family they said I had it good and I should be grateful. I\u2019m transgender which is another reason they just really didn\u2019t like me. One time when I went to the police my mom threw herself into a cabinet and said I threw her, and I ended up having to go through the legal system as a very naive autistic innocent kid who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. I was constantly just told I wasn\u2019t wanted, pushed, hit, and when I ran away on my 18th birthday they made me feel like a monster for leaving.

I initially started going because I felt like I generally needed support with being almost entirely closeted outside of the net and needing help with getting the support of my parents. The more I stayed on the more the subject became 'me' overall, and over the year or so I've been in therapy now it's the most productive it's been, rather than just doing tunnel vision on a specific problem. She's on leave right now.\n\nI ended up describing some difficulties I was having with relationships and even just general socialising and it lead to us doing the adult attachment interview. In the course of that, I was describing stuff with my parents. I described some particular incidents where I remembered being pushed against a hard plastic prop in a theme park when I was a kid, another when my mother screamed at me and threw my own shoes at me, and another where I remembered her grabbing me, spinning me around and shoving me onto a curb before storming away. In each of these instances, I had been annoying them prior in some fashion, or misbehaving. There's probably a few others, but those stood out.\n\nI told my therapist about how I would remember these events, rather vividly, every few weeks or so and that the more I talked about my parents over the sessions - which took some effort, as I would avoid the subject earlier on - the more frequently I thought about them. And apparently that, uh...apparently that's not normal? Prior, I had just assumed it was normal to keep remembering stuff like that. We got to the end of the interview, over the course of 3 sessions because I kept crying during it. High on anxiety, high on avoidance. Congratulations. It's a Fearful-Avoidant.\n\nWe continued talking about these things, still do. It was the first time someone referred to what I went through as incidences of abuse. I would always just say to myself, before this, that I couldn't have been abused because my parents cared about me, or it didn't count as abuse because it was inconsistent, because I was never routinely or ritualistically beaten, or that it didn't count because I deserved it.\n\nA few weeks ago, my mother accused me of disrespecting her after not responding to some asinine suggestion. I ended up being made to sit in front of my parents and made to tell them why I will talk about things to a therapist without telling them. So I was upfront about it - 'you have a history of treating me with anger and violence'.\n\nI was immediately met with incredulity. I was made to outline the events. I named them. One of them - the shoes - she said she didn't remember.  Two others - spinning me around and put to the curb, and being shoved against a prop at Legoland - she says I was misremembering. The former, she just pushed me away because I was being (her words) 'such a horrid thing', the latter, she says I fell and they were helping me up (I have cerebral palsy, balance issues - results in overprotective helicopter parents, to boot). Now, I'm not going to say she was wrong. These were years ago. More than a decade. Nearly two decades in one instance. And every time you remember something, you make an imperfect photocopy of it. My perception, built up over the years as I somehow drifted further and further from my parents, may not be perfect.\n\nShe then went on to ask me if I remembered one time that she definitely did hit me - I said I didn't. She explains an instance where she slapped me, because I was misbehaving, and she was mortified afterwards. 'See, you're remembering it wrong, it's all made up.' I felt like we were approaching something, because at least here she was admitting, of her own accord, to some wrongdoing.\n\nThen, she said 'It was probably even just the shock of it then, I didn't hurt you.' My face fell. She admits to actually hitting me once, then justifies it with simultaneous 'you deserved it' and 'it wasn't even a real hit'.\n\nThat's the thing that kept me grounded. That wasn't okay. It wasn't okay to justify it. It wasn't okay to effectively corner me and make me spill the beans over what's going on in therapy because I'm seen as property. But still, the doubt remains - what if I'm wrong about this stuff that happened to me? What if I'm remembering it a certain, innaccurate way, and it's colouring my perception of everything else?\n\nEven if my memories are wrong, though, the effects are there. I struggle with relationships. In bad days I dread getting up and seeing my parents. I feel anxious at mealtimes when I have to be near them. I am very apprehensive about the notion of going on vacation with them. I had trouble talking about them in therapy and when my therapist suggested a roleplay for tackling a subject, I just locked up and couldn't do it. That shit just doesn't come from nowhere, right? And if you want to look at fearful-avoidance as springing from your primary caregivers simultaneously giving you a lot of love and a lot of pain, well that day, where I'm being held and told that they'll 'support me' as a trans person while justifying and denying shit that my mother did to did to me, all from effectively forcing me to answer questions (understand, 'leave the room' is not something that presents itself as an option in my mental landscape) and prioritise my mother's pain over 'being disrespected' above all else, *that's* a big fucking dose of that.\n\nSorry for the long post.

We believe he may have also used some medicine or alcohol to make him drowsy but we are still awaiting toxicology results. By the time we got there the bags were removed from his body but layed beside him. Initially seeing him helped calm my mind. I had created a much more gruesome picture in my head and truly he looked very peaceful like he was just taking a nap on his bed. We also found his cellphone, he made a playlist on YouTube titled \"the end\" and it was the last thing he listened to. The playlist contained only songs from Weezer, which happened to be one of my favorite bands. \n\nI was sitting downstairs in their living room when the staff from the funeral home came to collect him. The thing that broke me, was hearing them zip up his body. I guess at that point it became real to me. Seeing him at his viewing also ruined me. He looked nothing like himself. He was caked with so much makeup but I could still see the bruising. \n\nSince then, I cant sleep a full 8 hours. I think the most I've gotten in one night straight was 4 hours.

When I was freshly 16, I was raped during a party in a small apartment, with the door open, and nobody helped me. I began acting out and getting in a lot of trouble after this, ultimately landing myself in acute inpatient for suicidal thoughts. I wrote my parents a letter telling them what happened to me, and social workers had to come in the hospital and report it with me. They never, ever contacted me or my parents EVER again. That alone is its own damage. \n2 years later, freshly 18 now, I began working as a houseman in a hotel. This means I cleaned everything except for inside the actual rooms. Well, there was a man that would stay Monday-Thursday for his construction job. He took an interest in me quickly, asking my age, where I go to school, then progressing into telling me I have \u201cbeautiful bedroom eyes\u201d and \u201cpure ness in my smile\u201d I knew he was up to something. He then began asking me which car is mine, when do I get off work, will my parents be waiting on me to come home from work tonight, etc. I began to be paranoid even when I left work, getting trapped in moments of my 16 year old self, thinking nobody cares what would happen to me, because after all, the police don\u2019t care about me.  At one point he entered the lady\u2019s restroom where I was cleaning, had me in a corner, touched my arm and asked how I like the new job. :( \nOne day, and this is so hard for me to tell because it became a repressed memory until my second hospitalization in October 2019, I was vacuuming the second floor hallway. Humming to myself probably, at the very start of this floor, the door to my left opened quickly. An arm, with orange hair and freckles, oh my god this is it, an arm grabs me. It was the man. He held me just inside the room, my left foot in the doorway. He told me to look in his eyes, gripped my arm tighter, and held me there. I was thinking to myself that this is it, he has me. He could\u2019ve done whatever he wanted. It felt like my eyes were looking into his for years, and his eyes, they were like... glass. Empty, yet fiery.  My mind made me see myself, naked, beaten, raped, and left all alone in the woods to rot. He let me go and I finished my shift. I was in a state of denial, showing up to my following shift in the morning. When I got to the second floor again, I actually passed out, and I\u2019ve never passed out! I completely fell to the ground, it felt like I swallowed a rock. \nLong story, but my entire 2018 consisted of horrible paranoid thoughts and migraines, but I had forgotten this incident for a long time, so my therapist and I had a hard time getting it under control. Now that I remember, my life is bad. I have also borderline personality disorder that causes me MUCH distress on a daily basis, but now I\u2019m miserable. I have flashbacks during the day time, I can\u2019t even take the trash out alone. I\u2019ve lost all my friends. My relationships are shallow and meaningless, except for my boyfriend. I never feel safe. I have gotten to the point of accusing my father of trying to rape me (absolutely delusional, he\u2019s never touched me) and had similar accusations to my friends and even my boyfriend at some points.

Bipolar disorder is\u00a0generally\u00a0characterized by extreme changes in mood, ranging from mania (highs) to depression (lows). There are different types; however, so here is a\u00a0website that\u00a0gives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder: http:\/\/www.webmd.com\/depression\/guide\/bipolar-disorder-manic-depression?page=2After reviewing these symptoms, if you believe you may have bipolar disorder, then you may want to see your primary care provider or\u00a0a counselor. Bipolar disorder is treatable, but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management. For example, some people may not get regular sleep, but proper rest is important for bipolar management. A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make.\u00a0The good news is that many people live happy, healthy, and productive lives with bipolar disorder. So, if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder, it doesn't mean that things can't get better. There is currently no \"cure\" for bipolar disorder, but with proper medication and lifestyle management, people can do quite well.Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

My parents were physically and emotionally abusive. I was scapegoated from an early age due to behavioral\/developmental issues and received the brunt of their abuse(which was inflamed by their crippling alcoholism). I\u2019ve also suffered with a panic disorder since I was 16, I was prescribed Xanax did 5 years to cope with it. The attacks cane out of nowhere but were so awful and debilitating. they\u2019d happen numerous times a day, My heart would pulsate through my chest, I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe and due to hyperventilating for hours I would have pins and needles all over my body, my hands would lock up to where I couldn\u2019t pry my fingers apart (tetany( and my knees would buckle before falling to the floor. \n\nWhen I was 18 (I\u2019m currently 20f), I was becoming untethered and all of the repressed memories I hid from were piling up and crowding my mind. Unbeknownst to me (at the time), I was on the cusp of a mental breakdown, my mind was filled to the brim and ready to combust. I met this guy, well..the first time I technically crossed paths with him was a year  prior, I was 17.\n\nOn my 18th birthday he messaged me on Facebook and sparked conversation, we talked for a while and it all was platonic and innocuous enough that no alarm bells went off in my head. He  was in his late 20s, a teacher, musician and overall an interesting and intelligent person ..my naive and insecure younger self  was so flattered and bewildered that someone like that took an interest in me. We met up and drove around, hung out at his place and divulged in deep conversations for hours on end. \n\nAfter a couple of times he became very flirtatious and made a pass at me. \nI was pretty sexually inexperienced and he knew that, in hindsight I feel as though  he fetishized my innocence (he casually) brought it up countless times. When we first started hooking  up , it was pretty vanilla and ..normal I guess.\n\n\nOvertime he began to become really aggressive and rough , he was kind of coercive and disregarded some of my boundaries. He would choke me so hard to where I would run out of air and the next day my neck would be riddled with bruises (I was okay with choking but not that extreme). I have a visceral memory of how dark and sinister his eyes looked while he would do this. \n\nOn one occasion he did something  I did NOT consent too and it really upset me, I consented you\u2019re sex but not what he did in the midst of it(I don\u2019t feel comfortable being less vague ) it wasn\u2019t I\u2019ve isolated thing, but during that instance I remember spacing out until it was over with..was paralyzed and couldn\u2019t think. He took me home and gave the impression he was oblivious and things were fine ,  I didn\u2019t tell him what I was feeling. I felt stupid because I am partially responsible for putting myself in a compromising position and allowing myself to be taken  advantage of, I also had such little value in myself that I didn\u2019t want him to stop seeing me. After a while he ghosted me, and I was devastated. I was angry and felt used and beat myself up over it for a while. \n\nHe also dated a string of girls around my age, I didn\u2019t find that off until it was over though. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone about this, I didn\u2019t want my parents to find out or to be judged but I feel like this was a tipping point into my descent of substance abuse and depression. \nThere were so many other things that contributed \nTo my depression manifesting and festering over time and this wasn\u2019t the worst thing that happened to me per-say but it was the straw that broke the camels back. \n\nI haven\u2019t had sex in 2 years  I don\u2019t date and I wish that I could go back In time and stop everything from happening.

Hi everyone. \n\n\n\nI(28f) developed PTSD as a result of workplace trauma. My workplace insurance are paying for my doctors appointments, psychiatrist and psychologist appointments, as well as my prescribed medications.\n\nAs a result of my diagnosis, I undergo EMDR with my psychologist, and my Psychiatrist has me on a number of drugs, and also monthly hospital admissions for TMS (trans cranial magnetic stimulation) which greatly improves my mood. My hospital admissions and TMS treatments aren\u2019t covered by insurance because they believe it to be nothing more than placebo....but that\u2019s a story for another time!\n\n\nSo basically, I\u2019m receiving good care, and \u201cmainstream\u201d treatment. I also meditate, exercise six days a week and have a healthy balanced diet. I don\u2019t drink alcohol and I don\u2019t take illicit substances. I try to do everything within my power to work on getting better.\n\n\n\nMy workplace have come to me and my return to work rehab provider to see if there is anything else they can support me with and to see if there is anything else the workplace insurance crowd will fund, while I am still employed there. \n\nI\u2019m being medically discharged from my job, so anything they can pay for in the meantime, I\u2019d love to give a shot. Then if I find something that works for me, I\u2019ll continue to fund myself.  \n\n\nMy rehab provider has come up with a few ideas which are currently being put to the insurance crowd to see if they would fund. These ideas are;\n-life coach\n-group ptsd therapy sessions.\n\n\n\nMy question is, have you heard of any treatment (no matter how outlandish it may seem) that you know of which could possibly help relieve some symptoms of this beast? \n\nHave treatments like acupuncture or hypnotherapy for example been known to help? Any outlandish treatments you\u2019ve heard of or programs you are aware of? \n\nFor example, I\u2019ve heard of psychologists administering mind altering drugs (brought up by my psychiatrist actually - I want to say cocaine?....but I can\u2019t remember.

I know not everyone has their medications and treatments paid for by someone else. I am grateful for this silver lining to a shitty rain cloud. I hope I don\u2019t come across as being insensitive to other people\u2019s circumstances.

The thing is that even the thought of PTSD had never popped into my head before a couple nights ago.\n\nI was watching a cop drama where the main character had to go to a therapist for an evaluation. All of a sudden, BAM, that sounds a lot like me.\n\nSo here\u2019s my story.\n\nLast year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed. I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can\u2019t and even if I could I probably wouldn\u2019t share). Unfortunately, she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn\u2019t save her.

I called a friend tonight and told her what I was thinking and she told me that she\u2019s suspected it for months! She didn\u2019t know how to tell me what she thought.

My mom was mentally ill and beat me and my siblings on a daily basis and my dad beat my mom often in front of us children. My mom yelled at me for everything: If I laughed to much, If I cried, if I was angry so basically when I showed any emotion at all. If I did well in school (A:s were the only acceptable grade) helped her by being her emotional support as soon as I came home from school aka listening to her problems etc she would not beat me. But as soon as I did the slightest wrong she beat me and told me that she wished that she had just done an abortion etc \n\nI remember that my mom used to beat me when I was 4-7 years old just because I was so ugly. She pulled my hair and slammed me into a wall and she beat me and cried at the same time and yelled that I was a disappointment in every way. She forced me to have my hair up in a high ponytail or else she would beat me and pull my hair. I am born with a large forehead but the high ponytails only made it worse (I never wear my hair up now bc is how large of a forehead I have) I was also bullied because of that and because everyone knew that they beat me at home so in school they knew that I was an easy target, I remember just laying in my own piss one time because I was so scared after being beaten in school and scared of going home knowing that my mom would beat me because I pissed my pants. \n\nIn conclusion my childhood sucked and that has caused a lot of problems now that I am a young adult F21, especially in my relationship. Me and my BF M21  has been in a relationship for 2,5 years and he is wonderful. The problem is that I am so insecure, I can worry that he will meet someone better if he goes away to work or just goes to buy some groceries. I am constantly feeling as if I am not enough and that he will leave me for anyone because I see other people as better than me, like I really mean every human I meet. I have a lot of anxiety and have a hard time talking to him about this, I really try to and are not actively refusing to talk but I often just don\u2019t know how to describe it. I also don\u2019t want to control him or let my anxiety make him shitty because it is not his fault, he has never given me any reason to even be worried but still I feel like shit. I feel sad sometimes and jealous when he hangs out with friends but I never tell him that he should not hang out whit them and he hangs out with them despite me having panic attacks and feeling as if I suck and that he will find someone better etc etc etc \n\nI am 100% aware that my feelings are not valid, I am loved but I just can not feel it and believe it. I go to trauma focused therapy (PTSD) so I am working on it and by BF knows about it and we always talk about it. He usually hugs me and tells me that he loves me etc and I just lay in his arms crying like a baby and knowing that my feelings are stupid but just can not make them go away.\n\nSo, Reddit or r\/ptsd what do I do and am I the only one who feels like this?\n\nI love my BF so extremely much and I really want to grow old with him and have kids and be together through everything but I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way. As if I should leave him before he leave me and that this is an example of how fucked up and unworthy of love I really am. I just don\u2019t want to hurt him and I know that my heart would shatter into pieces without him but if that is what is better for him then I want that. He says that he is happy and we really are happy most of the time but this ruins so much. \n\nAnd also, during one year I had this thing were I bought stuff on credit and it started out as what I thought a one time thing but then I used it as a coping mechanism. During that time I did not really understand that it was bad but when I realized about 6 months ago I knew that I needed to talk to my BF about it but I did not want him to leave me so I held it a secret for three more months and then I finally told him.

In virtual reality exposure therapy, the person is immersed in a computer-created virtual environment. While initially developed for advanced game play, it was quickly realized that the technology could also be used therapeutically.  The first study with ten veterans demonstrated that this therapy was effective in symptom improvement in all participants. This success was considered so significant that after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York\u2019s World Trade Center, burn victims suffering from PTSD were treated using virtual reality exposure techniques. The outcomes for this treatment situation was also extremely successful. \n\nTo date, virtual reality exposure therapy for PTSD has primarily been used with Vietnam War veterans so the virtual setting includes such imagery as helicopters and jungles. Research has shown that this type of therapy helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in these veterans. A few subsequent studies conducted with small numbers of Iraq and Afghanistan War vets found that virtual reality based therapy was also helpful in reducing symptoms in these former soldiers. \n\n[This article](https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/the-only-way-out-is-through-using-virtual-reality-for-ptsd-in-veterans-a0a3a0b1b3db?source=friends_link&amp;sk=67afc5dbc04e6a71afec35e744d68eb1) discussed an amazing personal experience working on an inpatient PTSD unit at the VA Hospital in New Orleans.

I'm tired of paying the punishment for his crime for him.\n\n I'm tired of the nightmares I have of him, of freezing up when I remember how he used to look or sound or feel or smell. I'm so sick of feeling severely physically ill every day because of all this. I've had to take a lot of time off from work, spend time and money on treatment, deal with debilitating physical and emotional pain from what he's done to me. On the worst days, I'm bed ridden, I've lost weight because eating is hard on a lot of days. He fueled an eating disorder that I'm trying to recover from and it makes my lack of appetite from this stress even more complicated to deal with. \n\nIt's unfair. I can't report him to the law, the police wouldn't be able to do anything. \n\nBut I hope he's still truck driving. I hope when he steps on a truck one day, he gets into a one vehicle accident and no one else is harmed but him. I wish he could burn alive, trapped inside his truck and have a long, painful, horrible and awful death.\n\n Would it fix any of this? No. I'd still be suffering, and he still would have abused me and threw a giant wrench into my entire life. But right now he's happy and he has a bunch of friends and he gets to go have fun everyday. I'm scared of every new person that comes along because what if they're like him? I've cut contact and blocked him everywhere, but what if he still finds a way back? I can't deal with people touching me anymore. Sometimes I'll have someone at work touch me and each time it makes me feel physically sick. \n\nHe's done all of this to me, and I'm enraged that he has gotten away with this unpunished.

In fact I only registered to make this post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't think a lot about PTSD until a year or two ago when I just sorta got hit full force with something I didn't understand. As a man I was raised not to be a wimp and cry about my feelings and told to just suck it up and that's life and life isn't fair and all that other shit. I thought that's all well and good I'll just do what dad does and drink a few beers and watch TV and ignore everything. That worked okay for a few years, although I was really struggling mentally during that time, but then the wheels just came off at some point where I was too messed up in the brain to operate normally in society.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would get these nightmares that were so bad that they wanted to use me as an experiment for a new drug that's being trialed for use by the U.S. Military. I forget what it's called but essentially it's this blood pressure medication, but when you take it you never dream again for the rest of your life. I mean these nightmares were so insane I actually thought I might be possessed by a demon and considered seeking help from a priest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would get this anxiety that got so bad that I could not turn my back to someone or all this other weird shit. I'd always sit in a restaurant in a booth or chair with my back to the wall so I could see the whole restaurant and everyone in it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd also wake up in the morning looking like I had just been run over by a truck, but all I had done was sleep in my bed and have nightmares. I'd have insane wounds on my body that I could not explain. A lot of super bad bruises, cuts, what looked like road rash and other stuff like that. Some medical student I know said I might have been hurting myself in my sleep, but this is still unsolved really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't go through every last detail but what I'm getting at is that it got so strange and painful in such a short period of time and I had no idea where it was coming from. It was like I was being poisoned surreptitiously or something. I thought I was a tough guy but this was like physiological in nature. It made me so sick sometimes that I'd puke for days and not be able to sleep and I'd get dehydrated and have to go to the ER and get saline and a MRI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually I went to some therapist because I thought I had an anxiety disorder or something, but they were like no you got PTSD. I didn't believe it at the time, I was like \"yeah right\", because when I think of PTSD I think of like Apocalypse Now or something. As my condition and relationships with others has deteriorated I've come around to the line of thought that maybe I do have some form of PTSD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen or been a part of a lot of different things over my life that snowballed together, but the core of that snowball is a lot of child abuse stuff. I'm not going to flesh it all out because I don't want to trigger a lot of people. However, with my drug addict family a lot of the stories here of paramedics or cops resonate with me strangely because I've seen a lot of nasty stuff in that arena although I wasn't forced to do it as a profession it just occurred where I live. I also worked in the pseudo-capacity of an apartment building manager when I was still a teenager so I had to &gt;!go to the building when people had committed suicide via rifle to the face and they were still doing CSI shit and taking photographs and find someone to clean up the blood\/brain\/skull\/hair after the cops took the body away.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got sent to some place when I was a kid for drinking and taking Oxycodone because I wanted to kill myself because of the shit I had to deal with every time I went home from school and just the general state of life which was super lonely and dark and filled with violence and just all that good stuff. The place they sent me to was called SageWalk which is owned by the Aspen Education Group which is owned by Bain Capital in turn. Essentially, it's a concentration camp worse than what the Jews were put in in WW2 and that is not an exaggeration whatsoever. The Jews in WW2 at least had beds and buildings to sleep in, but we didn't even get that. We had to sleep on the ground outside. I didn't shower or change my clothes for four months and got no medical care. We still had to do all the work of any given 1930s era German work camp and people were worked until they literally dropped dead on the floor, but probably got fed slightly better because of the common availability of United Nations Relief Agency-style Sysco foodstuffs in the modern day. People still got hurt and died all the time though and we got beaten and abused by guards with weapons and were never allowed to leave even though we had committed no crime. You were also taken there by guys with guns who would like punch you in the stomach and laugh as you wheeze over, like they don't really see you as a human being. It was really not that much different from the Holocaust except it was targeted at kids with bad grades instead of Jews. I haven't even really touched on the stuff they did there, but you get the basic jist. It was such an extreme isolation though that over the course of however many months I forgot about chairs\/cars etc existing. I only remembered airplanes existed when a Piper Cub flew low one day doing some pilot training. Strange yet true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey operate as a pseudo-mafia enterprise like Scientology and it's very cult-like, so if you go against them or petition the Department of Human Services or whoever they'll just have Bain Capital file a lawsuit and shut it all down before it even gets off the ground. They eventually couldn't cover up this one murder they did so the FBI came in and closed the place, but they just reopened 6 new ones in different states with slightly different names. Everyone that works there also uses fake names so they can't be identified in court to be prosecuted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey forced me to stop using my real name and punished me whenever I did. I had to use some made-up cult name they gave me and call everyone else by their cult name. They made us do rituals which were traumatic, at least to me. I'd get woken up by some guy at like 5 A.M. and he would put his hand over my mouth and gesture for me to not speak or make a sound no matter what. He was like the High Priest and he would take me along with a few other acolytes to the top of this hill that was flat at the top like a plateau. Also with me were others that were like me. On top of this plateau were sigils and Freemasonic type symbols either carved into the earth or made out of rocks that were laid out to make such a pattern. I don't remember all of it but we called on the spirits of the cardinal directions and the old gods to come forth and aid us. Then we did this incantation thing to praise the sun as it rose and there was a lot of screaming and yelling where they'd get in your face and like move incense over you. It was pretty much Satanic Ritual Abuse, which people don't even think is real, but I was forced to do it or else I'd be starved and thrown to the ground over and over. Many other people will corroborate my story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of people say that once you break someone down mentally (like some \"creative\" interrogation or whatever) they never recover. This is a concept I'm only becoming aware of now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main problem is with triggers. In fact, it got so bad that I had to quit my job six months ago and I've been out of work since then and barely left my house in all that time in order to avoid triggers\/stimuli. Inside here I control the environment, out there I have no control there are others who are in control. Out there I have no power to stop the same thing from happening to me again, but in here I can just shoot anyone that comes in the door. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can go through my day totally normal and then smell a certain type of burning wood and then it just flips a switch. The only problem is it's not just the smell of a certain type of burning wood, but so many different things that are so mundane that there's no way to avoid them. Like certain bushes\/trees and the presence of snow (I live in California so not much of it) can really put me into a bad mode. It's like a mode where it's total fight or flight and everyone on earth is my enemy and I'm not safe anywhere and if somebody grabs me by the arm or tries to put me in handcuffs I'd probably stab them to death. When I got kidnapped and taken to that place those guys with guns put me in handcuffs, so even if some cop nicely asks can I put cuffs on you while I search your car I'm just thinking in my mind not so good thoughts. Since as you cops say \"hands kill\" and to be totally bound and at someone's mercy with no way to defend yourself is not something I'm really into, especially after the last time it happened and I went through something not unlike going to Guantanamo Bay like with a black bag over my head and everything with guns to my head and people saying they'll kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, these are obstacles to having a normal life with some degree of satisfaction or happiness in it. I would like to have a wife and kids, but I find it impossible to trust or be close to people. If I trust someone enough to tell them what I've just posted here they see me as broken and crazy and want nothing to do with me. So it's kind of a lose-lose situation and I've been on my own with this for about 13 years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't stay in my house forever and never go outside again so what can I do to bring myself back into the fold when I hit one of those triggers? Even when I'm doped up on tranquilizers it doesn't always fully stop the rush of memories and sensations that come flooding into my soul. I know there's a lot of guys on here who have some sort of technique to keep them going, I just really need to know what it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen to my little monologue.

I\u2019d like to preface this by saying I have not been diagnosed with PTSD, nor have I experienced anything life-threatening, but at the time of the experience I couldn\u2019t tell what was going on. I\u2019ve just noticed huge changes in a lot of different aspects of my life recently, and I\u2019m looking for answers; google searches gave me results about PTSD leading to seizures, which is the reverse of what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019ve done lots of research into what I\u2019ve been feeling and how I\u2019ve been behaving, but I hit a roadblock here and so I\u2019m helping you guys can advise me a bit.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I had two seizures in one night. A few weeks prior to that, I had one seizure, but that was nothing compared to the doubleheader from right before Christmas. The first one occurred right after I used the restroom late at night; I turned around after putting the toilet seat and lid down, and sort of blacked out visually while retaining semi-consciousness. I fell onto the side of the bathtub (luckily the curtains stayed up, haha), then slid onto the floor, completely out of control of anything. I was even making moaning noises and saying \u201cno\u201d repeatedly, but neither of those actions were voluntary. I was too tired to even move from the floor, and my right leg and right arm were hurting terribly, but I couldn\u2019t tell you whether it was on account of the fall or muscles spasms. \n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity (but more likely around 5-15 minutes), I managed to get up and limp to my room next door to the bathroom, but no sooner had I closed the door than I collapsed halfway onto my bed frame and slid onto the floor again. This one is what I think the trauma stems from; I couldn\u2019t see or hear anything, and all I could feel was as if I was being electrocuted (if you\u2019ve ever used one of those machines that applies shock to a specific muscle, it was like that on maximum power throughout my whole body). I have no idea how long it lasted, I just know that I could feel my vocal chords crying out without actually hearing them. By the time I regained hearing, I was mumbling \u201cturn it off\u201d over and over again, and the whole thing seemed to end right as I finally clearly yelled, \u201cplease turn it off,\u201d aside from the arm\/leg pain, headache, and profound confusion.\n\nSince that experience, I haven\u2019t felt or acted like myself at all, and I was insistent on getting into the neurologist\u2019s office as soon as possible so I could prevent myself from ever experiencing that again. I now live in extreme fear of having another seizure, and all motivation I had to do anything seems to have been completely derailed. I\u2019m tired of being so scared to experience it again, and I\u2019ve found myself constantly going off on people when there are no justifiable grounds to do so. I\u2019m not trying to dodge responsibility, but my reactions to so many things don\u2019t even feel like they\u2019re my own, I just sort of engage autopilot until things get complicated and I\u2019m left trying to figure out what the hell is wrong with me. I can give more specific examples if need be, but I\u2019ve already typed a lot and I don\u2019t want to clutter this post with unnecessary paragraphs. Like I said, I\u2019m just looking for potential answers as to what could be wrong, so if I\u2019m in the wrong place or you know somewhere better to ask about this, please let me know; thank you so much in advance\n\n"},{"id":"2476_incel","text":"Somebody should create a doomsday group, with the aims of hacking nuclear silos... and ending it once for all."},{"id":"2477_ptsd","text":"I don't know how to cope anymore, but I want to I'm in my first year of university and was diagnosed with ptsd last year because of the death of my identical twin and the resulting events. \n\nI'm studying something I'm  so passionate about, and I've got big ambitions to go to medical school after this.

The abuse all started in 2009 when I first entered college. I was on and off about them, but taking advice from other friends that no friends group always have easy times, I kept forgiving them. \n\n1. The \"leader\" is a cynical person who believes he can do no wrong and talks behind everyone's backs. He often shot down people when they were excited about a movie or an activity. For example, if I was excited about a new movie from a franchise coming out, he would go like \"You're not even a fan of this franchise, why are you so excited?\". On days where he was actually nice, he'd make this sinister condescending \"laugh\" like \"Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\" I later found out he told everyone that I was clinically insane.\n2. There's the leader's favorite, who was nice during one on one hangouts, but whenever the leader wass around, he berated me together with him. He would often write Facebook statuses tagging me, trying to shame me on social media over things he puts out of context, or things he completely made up. Whenever I confronted him about this, he'd seem apologetic and say it was a joke, only for him to do it again the next day. He would drop n-bombs in public, without any concern that people are listening to him.\n3. There's the white supremecist (with only Asians being exempt), who does this thing where he calls you out over something innocuous you wrote on social media, and keeps egging you on until you get angry. He also attacked people that comment on my statuses. He would join in with the n-bombs with the leader's favorite.\n4. There's the condescending smart guy, who's now a doctor, but he would be generally very verbally abuse and make statements like \"go kill yourself no one loves you\"\n5. There's the quiet guy, who makes absolutely no contribution to the group, yet everyone treated him with respect. He knew my relationship with the rest of the group, so one day when he found out I was dating someone he liked, he gave me the silent treatment and manipulated the situation where he got the rest of the group to bag on me. That was what made me finally leave.\n6. The last was someone I considered my best friend, and had a fairly normal life.

I have rarely spoken about it since it happened. I was disssauded from being public about it, and I now realize that those people although well meaning were wrong. \n\nBecause being secret has only added to my shame and has crushed my self esteem. Now I'm realizing I want to be more open, but I thought the Internet is a good place to start. Part of my issue with sharing is that I can't fathom if anyone would have gone through anything equally terrible, although I logically know that of course people have. \n\nThis story is quite traumatic, so don't read if you're feeling fragile:\n\nWell I began being groomed by an older man (49) when I was 17. I was (am) autistic and extremely naive and with somewhat neglectful parents so I was the perfect target  At age 18 he started with the sexual advances and I was lured into a three year thing you can't even call a relationship because it was so disturbed. \n\nHe was also married with three kids and the craziest thing was I ended up living under his roof from age 19 to 22 and was sworn to absolute secrecy. His wife didn't have a clue, but later in the piece, he brainwashed her into watching while he had sex with me about once a week, and at the same time, concealing the real 'relationship' he and I had underneath, where he blackmailed me into having sex with him sometimes several times a day. \n\nAnd meantime all this was going on with his children around completely clueless because he was such as clever freakin bastard. Then on top of all that, he manipulated (through suggestiveness) his wife into 'having the idea' that the three of us go out and swing, which basically meant that once every few weeks he'd organize for us to meet with a guy or even a guy and his wife, and I would be effectively gang banged  (gang raped if you take the level of sheer coercion into account). \n\nIn the months leading up to my leaving, he started talking about organizing larger and larger gangbangs (gang rapes) and i have no doubt he would have followed through if I'd not been able to leave. He also photographed and videod a lot of our encounters and I have no doubt he's still watching me naked on tape often as there was no law requiring him to get rid of this.\n\nThere were other elements to this abuse too, such as a high level of emotional abuse, cult like spiritual brainwashing, and even after I managed to leave him, it ended with stalking and so me filing for a protection order and an eight month battle through the legal system to get one.\n\n While I was on the cusp of leaving rhe relationship, I became acutely suicidal because it was so damn hard to get away from him and the people at the mental health center said they'd never seen someone so suidical. \n\nThis man destroyed my life right on the cusp of adulthood.

I clarified with her that attendance at the meeting would be my highest priority and asked for a full roster of needed ADA Accommodations. She agreed with most of my suggestions, we implemented a plan that's been working since. She was asked to follow up with HR on my request that all PTSD-related absences be excluded from the policy (she raised that I was \"getting into trouble\" with the policy and she would have to let me go if I violated it). I never heard back, so didn't worry about it (she has always been very lax with the attendance policy for all in the department).\n\nFlash to February 2018, I have my first high-symptom call-out day (8 hours) in a while (about 3 months). Boss reviews all my absences since my return, and asks for documentation on two from 2017. She says it is because I'm bumping against the company policy for too many absence occurrences in 12 months. She is only looking at PTSD-related events, as the two times I had the flu this year didn't spark any kind of review, nor did non-PTSD absences last year. I ask her about the policy exception we discussed in August, and suddenly she's on the defensive. She responds that there is no exception, and decides she told me about this last year. It didn't happen, so I ask for documentation. She can't find any.\n\nLast Monday, I had a meeting with HR to \"formally\" open my ADA accommodation request. Per the company, this is the first time I'm asking for anything, because my boss never brought my August conversation to HR, nor educated me that there was additional steps to formalize it. I meet with HR, I give them an updated list of accommodations, they give me paperwork for my doctor - no problem.\n\nWhen I look at the paperwork, the job description isn't mine - it is for a coworker in another department. I send a copy of what I have on file, and ask for confirmation it is correct. A WEEK LATER I am still arguing with my supervisor and HR as they keep insisting I hold a job that I do not (completely different scope than my actual job, as actually described in the JD I have from 2 yeas ago). My job description now needs to go through the full HR review process and be approved.\n\n**TL\/DR and Ultimate question:** Are they trying to screw me? The culture at my employer is one of intolerance\/purposeful ignorance of PTSD and its impacts. They do not take this seriously, and continue to set arbitrary \"blackout days\" that I \"cannot have a high symptom day on\" without risking my job. As you know - this is nearly impossible to agree to given the variability of trigger events. I think they're trying to let me go... am I being paranoid or could this be their shady way of saying I'm in a job that doesn't exist so am ultimately downsized and they avoid the ADA protections? \n\nHELP!"},{"id":"2492_counseling","text":"Your question highlights your pain very clearly. \u00a0\u00a0What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples: One partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward. \u00a0My mind immediately goes to a question for you: What happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? What do you say to yourself about you, about your spouse, and about your relationship?\u00a0 What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need?\u00a0 Does this lead to arguments?\u00a0 Do you stay silent or withdraw?Very often, couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as \"cold and aloof\" towards the relationship), and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as \"critical and nagging\"). \u00a0 Regardless of \"who started it,\" these patterns can\u00a0turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own, and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship. \u00a0 If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship, the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together. \u00a0 As the patterns\u00a0slow down, partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities, needs and longings, and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn't leave the other partner feeling criticized, threatened, abandoned, or uncared for. Some couples can do this without the help of a therapist. \u00a0 The book \"Hold Me Tight: 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love\" by Sue Johnson is a self-help book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists), and has been helpful to many couples that I see. \u00a0 When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals, I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy (such as Emotionally Focused Therapy. \u00a0 You can learn more about EFT or find an EFT therapist here: http:\/\/www. iceeft. com).

I relive that night everytime I come home. I'm moving when my lease agreement goes up. Summer time can't come soon enough. I'm in this constant nightmare. I hate it."},{"id":"2494_ptsd","text":"Unresolved Childhood PTSD from a near-death experience Hi there,\n\nSo this might be a bit of lengthy ramble, but bear with me. As a kid I used to love horse riding, so so much. I went to a prestigious equestrian school twice a week and did everything from hacking, to showjumping, to novice dressage. I got decent enough that I was really comfortable in the saddle. I loved going cantering because of the thrill, and I had confidence dealing with horses that spooked or acted difficult.\n\nHowever, one day when I was twelve I fell from horse during a showjumping event. It was a horse hadn't ridden much and wasn't used to its mannerisms. I later discovered I'd broken my coccyx (tailbone) and was in pain for weeks afterwards but because I immediately got back on the horse after the fall and continued to ride for bit, I wasn't too shaken up about it.\n\nAbout a month later, my parents were looking into buying a horse for me and we thought we'd finally found a good beginner horse. The owners seemed to think this horse was a good match, however, upon riding the horse I discovered that it was extremely flighty. It didn't listen to me at all and would just bolt off in random directions at a full gallop no matter how hard I tried to pull it back. At this point, I started to panic. I didn't like feeling like I wasn't in control of the animal. Eventually it threw me off, hard. I was okay, but determined to see if I could control this horse, I got on again. This was a mistake. The second time it threw me off at a full gallop (around 60km\/h) and I landed on my head. I had a bad concussion and couldn't see properly. I also had severe neckpain similar to a whiplash-type injury. I was also very very traumatised by what had happened. I felt paralysed by fear.\n\nAfter recovering from my physical injuries, I attempted to resume riding lessons but this failed. I couldn't be atop a horse for more than five minutes without breaking down in tears. Every moment I spent on horseback was pure terror, even with sound horses I'd known for years. Nothing seemed to help. My instructor began to get very frustrated with me, and this made me hate myself even more. Eventually my mum sent me to therapy where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Though the therapy was useful and I found myself unwilling to get on a horse again. My experienced had permanently turned me off horses.\n\nSo now I'm in my twenties, and considering revisiting the possibility of riding in a controlled environment with very sound horses. Although I don't think I still have PTSD (in that I no longer have nightmares or flashbacks) I am still suffering from a kind of trauma that I wish to heal. On the one hand I'm terrified of getting on a horse again, on the other hand I don't think there's any other way to put this behind me. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR: Had PTSD from falling off a horse and now almost a decade later I'm considering riding again."},{"id":"2495_counseling","text":"I was born a girl, but I want to be a boy.

Sorry!\n\nI've always had anxiety but a little over a year ago I got the courage to solo-travel New Zealand long term. I gained a ton of confidence while doing this, and overcame a lot of my social anxiety. Eventually I got a job in Christchurch, it wasn't all perfect, I had my ups and downs but I was doing pretty well - going for walks frequently, exploring the city, living a 'normal life'.\n\nThen the shooting happened. To be clear, I didn't see\/hear\/experience anything. My life was never in actual danger, I was just living in the city at the time. At first it was disbelief, then fear (not knowing if they caught everyone) then crippling sadness. I had such a strong desire to run away and just go home but I couldn't right away. One of my coworkers was shot and spent months in ICU. I left Christchurch a little over a week after the attack. It felt wrong, but I had been offered a job back home and had already put my notice in at work.  \n\nAt first when I got back home and started my new job I was mostly fine. I was living with my parents until I could get an apartment in the city closer to work. I moved into my apartment in May and started having issues pretty quickly. Waking up multiple times a night, disoriented and sweaty. Random attacks of sadness and excessive anger over small problems. Being afraid of random people on the street. Wanting\/needing to go do something (go to the store for example) and having a mental block. Anxiety over inconsequential things.\n\nI started going to therapy in June and he diagnosed me with PTSD. He gave me an ESA letter to get a dog which has helped immensely. But the therapy wasn't helping, my brain would kind of just shut off and I wouldn't have anything to say and I wouldn't remember anything he would say. It was really just giving me more anxiety so I stopped going.\n\nThe diagnosis just doesn't feel right to me. Maybe because I know I was never in any actual danger. I get intrusive memories of the sadness and aftermath though.  Recently I've been even more hyper-vigilant than usual. I listen to audiobooks at work so my mind doesn't wander but it makes me anxious because I don't always know when someone approaches me, and I jump when they do. I get anxious walking outside when its too quiet, dark, rainy (hood up, peripheral vision blocked) or too crowded, and I cant walk with headphones in. I feel like I am constantly stressed and anxious even though I have no real reason to be. I scratch at arms and hands and have a hard time making myself stop.\n\nI've always had problems with anxiety and mood swings so I'm having a hard time distinguishing from old symptoms and new. Part of myself keeps thinking that this isn't PTSD, this is just my anxiety coming back.\n\nI don't even know what I am looking for from posting this, other than maybe if other people have gone through the same thoughts."},{"id":"2497_incel","text":" how fat we talking about here? i can look passed some fat if she has a good face."},{"id":"2498_counseling","text":"Hello, I have a cousin in my family who has been making me feel belittled, insecure, and frustrated during her stay here in the city.

I have my heart rate spike when I have to do things related to my PTSD. If so, how is it treated? PLEASE ANSWER THIS ONE QUESTION IF YOU CAN, EVEN IF YOU DON\u2019T READ THE REST!\n\n\n\nHere is the long backstory you don\u2019t have to read, since I really just want to know how other people have treated elevated heart rate related to PTSD:\n\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m about to end up being treated for a heart condition I don\u2019t have, as I only have heart rate spikes temporarily when my anxiety is triggered. It used to make me agoraphobic because I was so convinced I was going to have a heart attack and die &amp; really interrupted my ability to function &amp; would go months at a time without leaving my house at all. I worked through that and although I still get the racing heart when I have to do things that relate to the PTSD, I am able to tell myself that it\u2019s temporary and will go away when the situation is over.  I used to take 6 msg of Xanax a day just to get out my front door and now I don\u2019t need anything. \n\nProblem is that I also have ADHD which I do require medication for...I get goldfish brain to the point I had 3 car accidents in 3 weeks off medication. At my last visit the guy I saw had issues with my heart rate and told me to see my pcp &amp; get clearance to continue on the medication I was taking. I\u2019ve been at this particular clinic for years and nobody ever had an issue with it so I started getting anxiety about it again. I went to the pcp, my blood pressure and heart rate were normal because I don\u2019t correlate her or her office to anything that triggers me. But I couldn\u2019t sleep at all last night and was a nervous wreck going to my appointment today because now I was not only triggered by having to focus on my mental health issues, I was stressed that the clearance letter wouldn\u2019t be enough and he\u2019d stop my medication. I track my heart rate with my watch and it was fine despite my anxiety all night and morning...until I started driving to my appointment. As expected it spiked &amp; as expected he stopped my medication.  I told him I could show him my heart rate history and show him I only spiked because of this appointment. Now he wants me to go back to my pcp again and get clearance again and come back in a month. But when I go to my pcp my heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be normal &amp; when I go to the clinic again, it will be elevated again so I don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nOn top of that, he told me with elevated heart rate like that my heart could stop, which seriously triggered the anxiety I had about that symptom. I sat in my car crying for an hour before I was able to get it together to drive home &amp; now I\u2019m having those familiar racing thoughts about my anxiety actually killing me &amp; I\u2019m scared to take my kids out. What if my heart stops while driving them? Or while we\u2019re out and about and there is nobody to help them? Maybe they\u2019d be better off because now I\u2019m going to have untreated ADHD &amp; in one 20 minute appointment I now feel the weight of the PTSD on me after years of feeling it was under control. He made me fill out the depression questionnaire (I was previously treated for major depression with TMS &amp; am on Prozac still) and I answered honestly about thinking my family would be better off if I was dead nearly every day and I was going to tell him that I was feeling very guilty about the impact of my mental health on my family. But he never picked up or even looked at the form. I left truly believing my family would be better off without me because now everything is about to get much worse for me and therefore them.

And here I am 20 years later feeling sentenced to life. I know I\u2019m going to be right back to having flashbacks and panic attacks and seeing his face in every stranger. I really wish I could restart this day and never go to that appointment. \n\nAll of this could be over if I could just not have situational heart rate spikes but he offered me no solutions to what I can do about that. I\u2019m hoping someone here has had similar issues and how you handled it. It\u2019s not related to the medication because I\u2019ve had this for decades even unmedicated and I purposely didn\u2019t take it the last 3 days out of fear of this exact thing happening.

A few months earlier than my PTSD diagnosis, I was diagnosed with GAD, and the two seem a world apart.\n\nI just need to get this off my chest.\n\nAs the second anniversary of the goddamn event that screwed my brain over approaches quickly, I've been falling into trap after trap with my PTSD. My triggers are the smallest, dumbest, most random ass things that no one would think are triggers. The most inconspicuous things just sets me straight into a panic attack. I try and smile through them but I'm struggling. I hate that these are my triggers. I don't dislike any of them, I want to normalize them, but I can't do that when I feel like I'm going to pass out every time I encounter them.\n\nI recently experienced sleep paralysis for the first time. And I didn't see some ungodly demon standing in the corner of my room or an old hag sitting on me, quite frankly I'd rather see them. I couldn't open my eyes, I was just paralysed, every inch of my body felt like lead, and all I felt was the sensations of the event and the sheer horror that ran through me as I refused to even attempt to open my eyes in fear that I'd come face to face with it.\n\nI'm losing sleep. I see movement out of the corner of my eyes and dark shadows in places where no one else sees them. I can't focus, my anxiety is wearing me down and my brain just slowly works its way back to what happened every time I try to shove it to the farthest reaches of my subconscious.\n\nIts frustrating that I can't find stories or accounts of others around my age experiencing the same things. Teenage PTSD is so stigmatized its actually dangerous. Apart from the occasional 'coming out of foster care' story, I don't find things I can relate to. I guess it makes sense.

I'm a survivor of domestic and sexual violence. We've rarely had arguments of this magnitude. We were just playing a fps game together on ps4 (we have 2, so in different rooms) and the game went bad and he slammed his fist on his desk really loud. It triggered the hell out of me. Honestly I know I asked him to calm down but I kinda lost the next bit then we were arguing and he was in here not quite yelling but like talking in a heated voice. If that makes sense. I just asked him to please just go to bed. He was angry, I don't know if I said anything to piss him off, I straight up lost time there. I blanked. I might have. Maybe I did. But it just hit me so hard and so fast. He apologized and he hugged me but by then I was literally just crying and saying over and over \"I'm sorry. Please stop yelling at me\" but he wasn't actually yelling. I have worked very hard for many years to handle my shit. And I lost it over a stupid thing tonight.

It can be a gesture someone does. It can be an unrelated noise. I'm in constant fight\/flight and very moody and can go from being snippy to breaking into tears. It's embarrassing at work.

Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another.  That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom's acknowledgment) and we kissed.  The next two days were a repetition of the first day.  On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house.  I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple.  It was very hard for us.  His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend's houses with the little money we had.  I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home.  There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot.  Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month.  After that, it was a downward spiral.  We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families.  We kept having the famous \"you're doing it wrong\u2014do it this way\" argument.  After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that's when the violence started.  One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me.  I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one.  He told me to let him leave or he would hit me.  He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it.  He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me.  I haven't had the courage to leave him, and there's really nothing stopping me now.  I don't live with him, I don't depend on him, and we don't have children.  We both haven't been able to let go of that deep connection that we still have and that has been damaged so badly.  He always apologizes, and at the beginning, he was more willing to change.

I never really considered the possibility that I might have PTSD until very recently. I'm currently 31...when I was 19, I entered into my first real relationship. It felt great but at the time, I think he was sexually abusive and I didn't know. He'd guilt me into doing sexual things that I didn't want to do. He'd guilt me into doing sexually uncomfortable things... then at some point towards the end of the relationship, he assaulted me. He violated me....I don't know if it was rape....I definitely said no to him. I told him to get off, and that we didn't have condoms, but he had me pinned down and he kept trying to penetrate me. I had my underwear on though while he was trying.....so he never actually went inside me. Luckily he gave up because I kept struggling so much. The whole experience was horrifying though and during it, I felt frozen and afraid for my life.\n\nAfter, I remember running to the bathroom and I just sat there wondering what the hell just happened. Did he rape me, or am I just freaking out over nothing? Later on, he said that I shouldn't be \"getting him excited\" if it's not going to lead to sex. He acted like he did nothing wrong... Basically, it was my fault. I lived with guilt, shame, and just overall disgust for a really long time. \n\nEver since then, I have not been the same person. I lost trust in people....I can't enjoy sex....I'm afraid to date and fall in love....I'm afraid of men touching me.... I just avoid relationships and love all together. \n\nAnd that was just the first relationship. I don't even want to get into the second relationship, but he sexually violated me too. He purposely tampered with a condom to get me pregnant to keep me from transferring away to college. He thought that I'd decide to keep his baby and stay local with him. I aborted it and moved away of course. That was when I was maybe 22 or 23. That was the last relationship. I've been avoiding dating because I'm afraid of history repeating itself. I've been single ever since and honestly, I'm just lonely and depressed. I never spoke to a doctor about any of this. I don't know what I'd be diagnosed with but I'm afraid. \n\nFast forward to now, there's a good person in my life who likes me. I think he's interested in me....I like him too but I'm still afraid. I don't know what to do or how to behave...I don't know what a good\/healthy relationship is supposed to feel like. I'm just nervous all the time and its involuntary...I can't control how I feel. The new person said that I'm hard to read. Like, he doesn't know how I feel about physical touch... I'm sure he can tell that I'm nervous. I just don't want him to think that I'm not interested in him, or that I'm disgusted of him because that's not true. \n\nFor a long time, I'd zone out...get lost in my thoughts. Oh, and nightmares. I'd have random nightmares of being attacked, violated, raped, assaulted, or just chased. Over the years I've been able to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, and that I shouldn't feel guilty or shameful. I tried practicing self love for a long time and I think it helped.

He thought I was lying. So he wouldn\u2019t let me ice me joint and would tell me I was weak. Eventually I believed him. I still do to an extent.

I have issues around men (not I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s because my biodad always intimidated me) so I told him that before we started dating. He was really sweet about it. I explained that if he yelled I would completely break down and if we have an argument, it wouldn\u2019t help. Our relationship has progressed and one night I was really having an awful night. \n\nCouldn\u2019t sleep and I had some really bad flashback like nightmares.

Always strict with my grades (understandable), but he also had a control problem. He always had to control everything relating to my family, even controlled my mother to the point where she wasn\u2019t allowed to spend any money from her own paycheck or wear any makeup to work. He was also emotionally &amp; mentally abusive to her, and emotionally, mentally, and physically abusive to my brother &amp; I on a daily basis (again, I always got it more than him). \n\nWhen I was a sophomore in high school, I was 5\u20195\u201d and a healthy 135-140 lbs. I was a small in tops and about a 6 in jeans, so I was never really considered fat or even overweight, just healthy. During this year, my dad became weirdly obsessed with my weight. He would force me to run and do at home exercises daily, he would also weigh me about once a week. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I feel like if I were the slightest bit overweight\/unhealthy then maybe he could of approached differently, like suggesting to eat better or maybe join him in some of his workouts. But no, I wasn\u2019t overweight and he FORCED me to workout. By my senior year of high school his obsession grew even grater. He was weighing me every morning and making me do more intense workouts to lose weight. I ended up weighing 117 lbs by the middle of my senior year. I was so skinny that I looked unhealthy, my collarbones would pop out. I wouldn\u2019t eat much around friends because I was afraid that if I did eat like a normal person, I\u2019d gain weight so I just told my friends excuses like I wasn\u2019t hungry or I had already eaten earlier. They would always tell me that I was too skinny and if everything was okay with me. I would end up telling my parents and my dad would respond with \u201cthey say that because they are jealous.\u201d \n\nIf I didn\u2019t weigh 117 lbs every morning- for example, if I weighted the SLIGHTEST bit over 117, like 117.4 lbs then he\u2019d take my phone away for the day, it would also cause him to get mad at me for gaining an extra 0.4 lbs which would usually end up in a verbal fight and then him hitting me (at 18 years old- and even though I was technically 18 he still controlled everything in my life... my phone, the money that I made at my part time jobs, my car).  I would only get my phone\/car\/friend privileges back if I weighed 117 lbs the next day. Weeks would go by and I would be stuck at 118-119 lbs, and even though I was doing all the workouts he made me do and barely eating, my weight would fluctuate, especially during my time of the month. So I would go weeks without my phone even though I was driving from school to work\/cheerleading practice, so if something were to happen while I was driving I had no way of calling for help. \n\nI remember not having a phone to take pictures with my friends on graduation day because I weighed the slightest bit over 117. This obsession continued into my freshman year of college when he forced me to live at home and commute to still have every bit of control over me. So, it was another year of weighing me every morning, physical &amp; emotional abuse if I didn\u2019t weigh what he wanted me to. I remember one day weighing 120 lbs and he looked at me like he was disgusted by the 3 pounds I had gained and called me fat, and would point out and say that my legs were already bigger from the day before even though I physically still looked the same, but my weight would change because, like I said, it is normal for your weight to fluctuate a couple of pounds. This minor change in weight could be cause by lots of things like retaining water. This continued up until the July before I started my sophomore year of college. \n\nThat July, he was mandated to leave my house because him and my mom were fighting and he hit her in the face and she told me to call the police, so I did. When he was getting escorted out by the police, I remember him turning to me and saying \u201cyou\u2019re the devil. I hate you.\u201d But what else was I going to do? He literally HIT my mom in the face, let alone the lifetime of physical abuse he caused to my brother and I. Fast forward 4 years.... I live with my mom, and my dad and I have a rocky relationship. I love him because he\u2019s my dad. I know he\u2019s always wanted the best for me but due to his narcissistic and controlling ways, he\u2019s had an awful way of showing it. I suffer from diagnosed anxiety, depression and PTSD from my childhood up until my early adult years. He still hasn\u2019t apologized for anything that he\u2019s done, nor realizes that he\u2019s the main reason I have those disorders. I\u2019ve tried to tell him repeatedly that what he did and what he continues to do is not right (no physical abuse anymore, just emotional and mental), including making me feel guilty for things or bad about myself. He also blames everyone else for getting arrested the day he hit my mother. I don\u2019t know what else to do to help him change or to at least recognize what he\u2019s been doing has truly damaged me. Every time I notice that he\u2019s trying to be a better person and try to mend the relationship with me, a fight happens and the unhealthy cycle starts again."},{"id":"2535_ptsd","text":"Some thoughts on dissociation? Not sure if this sub is the right place. Let me state beforehand (because that's the usual reaction) I'm not asking for pity or love or empathy or help or advice or \"go see a therapist\" or anything, I just wanna talk about the topic with people who may have something interesting to say about it. If you feel the impulse to do any of the above, please refrain, it's not helping or contributing anything to me for reasons I don't feel like having to explain over and over.\n\nOkay, so, I've been through some hideous shit as a kid and I think my personality is kinda split in a few parts. I've been doing meditating\/introspecting\/feeling into it and becoming more aware of the details over time.\n\nEither way, I am not sure how precisely I can put this into words and this may not make sense to most people, but I'll do my best to describe it accurately at least for those who've had similar experiences.\n\nIn particular, there is one aspect that I'd like to hear some interesting thoughts on.\n\nThere is this part of me that has kinda separated itself from the traumatized parts. This part seems very ... psychopathic, you could say. It's very detached and cool and rational, seeing all these things without feeling like they affect it personally.\n\nNow, I sometimes try to connect that part with the other parts, but when I \"jump into\" that part, I basically realize that this part finds the idea unacceptable\/offensive that the pain\/the other parts could have anything to do with it. \n\nIf that part could speak for itself, it would likely say: \"I am caught in this disgusting body, but this body is not me. I don't understand why this body has anything to do with me, I wouldn't have anything to do with something disgusting like that, it doesn't concern me. I am just sitting here and waiting to flee this body, it is not right that I have to be attached to this impure body that carries such a disgusting pain. I refuse to communicate with this body or the pain, because it is none of my responsibility to deal with it, for I am a separate person from that body and that other person (the body) should not expect me to take care of it, because it should be able to deal with it itself. It offends me that the body wants to drag me into this crap that has nothing to do with me. There's nothing for me to gain from such a partnership (me and the body), fuck off and take care of your own shit.\"\n\nMind you, this part is NOT in pain (most of the time). Rather, it refuses to be. It kinda conceives of itself as a kind of heroic resistance to the pain. This part of me is actually feeling kinda comfortable most of the time I would say. I would even say I feel a bit of pride in this part because it has such a clear view on everything and feels rather pure\/unspoiled. The downside is that this part is very mental\/celebral and does not really have any control over the body, so whatever great insights it allows, it cannot act on them, as the body wants to focus on the pain instead, which is frustrating. It feels confused and angry often, because the rest of the body doesn't listen to it and is controlled by fears\/needs that shouldn't really be a thing from its own viewpoint.\n\nThis celebral part in fact is so convinced that the pain has nothing to do with it that it treats it as not much more than, say, an annoying cousin that sometimes visits. It does not see it as a problem that needs to be dealt with. Just something that occasionally hinders it in being who it wants to be, which results in frustration and anger. Something that, if need be, has to be eradicated (which of course doesn't work). I suppose you could say it is arrogant, in its refusal to have anything to do with the other \"weak needy\" parts that are so easily controlled by outside circumstances and emotions. It considers such an existence as ... low and pathetic. Yet cannot escape it. \n\nOutside of anger when the other parts try to take over, it doesn't really feel much of any emotion at all. It's ... empty ... but in a satisfying detached way. It's not even necessarily evil I think, it can even be caring towards other people at times (but not really towards myself). It tends to be fascinated by intellectual problems and solving them.\n\nNow, what I've been trying to do for a long time is to try to force this part to connect with the other parts. But it doesn't really work. It simply refuses to do that and\/or \"tricks\" the other parts into believing it had accepted them, only to reemerge later with no change whatsoever.\n\nMy thinking is, I likely need to find a way to convince this part that it is in its interest to merge with the rest. Maybe that involves convincing myself that that is actually the right thing to do. Maybe I need to try out \"jumping into\" that part and letting it ask itself that question and figure it out.\n\nAnyway, I've come pretty far to even be able to see it as clearly as I do now and I'm sure I will eventually find my own answers, but I have to say I am a little intrigued by it and I was wondering if someone else who has dealt with some horrible shit has had similar experiences\/observations and has anything interesting to add or just wants to maybe exchange ideas\/observations, because its rather hard to find people who can follow this and thus good stimulating exchanges about it are rather rare.\n\nCheers"},{"id":"2536_ptsd","text":"[CW childhood abuse] My rabbit is sick and I'm losing it. I'm mostly posting this just to get it off my chest, but any advice you can give me would be super appreciated.\n\nI'm freaking out right now. My rabbit is sick, and we don't know what's wrong. She finally stabilised today, and the vet was frankly shocked that she survived. He's running some tests now to determine what caused this episode (GI stasis and hypothermia, in case you were wondering). Thing is, this is a huge trigger for me and I have no idea why. \n\nThe things that happened to me when I was a child were physical in nature for the most part, the only \"traumatic\" event I can think of that involved a pet was when my mother accidentally reversed over our (very old and deaf) cat while I was in the car. It was upsetting certainly, but compared to the other things that happened it seems \"minor\".\n\nWe lost another rabbit about 6 months ago to a tumor on her heart, and that broke me. I had to take time off work (I still haven't gone back) and that episode finally pushed me to seek therapy. At the time, I saw it more as the straw that broke the camel's back, but now I'm wondering if maybe there's something more.\n\nI fucking hate this all consuming anxiety. I can barely function.

This all started when I had a boyfriend about 10 months ago. My boyfriend and I were dating for a couple months and decided to get in to sexual acts. At the time, I was pretty religious, but I let this happen. I don't know why. I felt kind of guilty but mostly because I know my parents wouldn't like it. My parents are very religious\u2014they're Christians. We did things every time he'd come over to my house. We didn't have anything to do at our house, so we would get tempted to do things when we'd watch movies by ourselves.\n   One day, my parents found out I did this stuff with him because my dad read my messages. As soon as my dad found this out, he told my mom. They were both aggravated. They told me he was just a boy that wanted to get inside my pants. They said he wanted me for sex and he's not a Christian. I took their advice and broke up with him. Once we broke up for about a month, I decided to get back together with him a little after school started. My parents found out eventually, and I decided to not listen this time. I would constantly talk to my boyfriend about what they say about him: how's he's not the right one for me, and God totally forbids him. I would kind of try to break up with him, and then eventually I would just never listen to my parents. They're always yelling at me about how I shouldn't date this boy. I felt too old to listen to them. Now I'm kind of just stuck. Is the real me religious? Have I been brainwashed by him? I don't talk to my parents anymore about him, and my parents think I'm deceiving because of it. They threatened me that if I'm still with him, I can't do track and they won't support me. They've also called me slut, and now they called me basically a devil worshipper. They say my boyfriend is taking me away from my parents. I'm actually very happy with him.

However, if you're feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts, feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all, and you're starting to find that it's getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want, then I'd suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety.\u00a0Your other concerns, though, seem pretty \"normal\" for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children. As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step\/blended family dynamics - because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved. You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership."},{"id":"2550_counseling","text":"It might be helpful to have a good understanding of the \"why\" in terms of feeling nervous around people, or the difficulty in developing more comfort.

Everyone struggles in some aspect, so to not necessarily think of yourself as pathological is a first step. Sometimes being around people can trigger an anxiety related to being \"good enough\" that goes back a ways in our history.

Then, 4 more years passed and my mom finally got full, but he had visitation every other weekend. As you can probably guess, it got worse. I was 16 when he finally tried to kill me by abandoning me up in upstate New York on a mountain with no food or water on a 12 hour hike (normally 12 hours). I got lost and too a long trail around and was out on my own for 36 more hours before I finally made it to the trail head and called the police.

Im a student in the last month of my (paid)internship and I have been feeling guilty about calling in sick a lot. My supervisors are very understanding and kind, thats why I was able to keep up the work most parts of the months. \n\nBut now Im really struggling with the last straws. I have a paper due and it is stressing me out. Usually I called in sick once every two weeks or worked from home once a week because getting out of my house in the morning gave me anxiety. I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up. Maybe I just need someone to tell me you know its okay to call in sick, you dont have to feel guilty your working on yourself and thats whats most important. I self lack this view because I mostly dont consider myself helpworhty, which is another problem on its own. \n\nI already contacted my mentor from school yesterday. The last time we spoke she told me I could figure it out with the internship company if I knew what would work for me. Problem is, I dont know what works for me. Each day is different. Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go. So I feel like it would give me some rest if I gave myself time to work on this paper or going to the internship part time. That way everyone knows what to expect from me instead of just seeing if I will be able to show up everyday. \n\nOn the other hand, over the holidays when I had some time off I felt awful. I really dont like being on my own all day and had a lot anxiety that I had to show up for work the next week. So being at home all the time didnt work out that well. \nI never called in sick for a longer than a day in the past because the pressure to show up and fear of losing my job or getting kicked out of school. But thats what is getting back to me now cause I dont have a healthy view on how to get better.\n\n\n\n\nAs you see Im constantly questioning myself, I just dont know what would be appropriate for someone in my situation. How do you guys handle this stuff? What do you do to get productive and how do you handle the stress of a deadline when there is so much going on in your head? Have you taken a longer time of work to deal with your mental health and how did that work out?\n\nThank you so much for reading this, I am very new to all this and its a bit of a thing for me to ask advice cause it means admitting I need help.

First, I want to thank you for sharing your stories and for creating a supportive community where PTSD can be discussed. I have been kind of lurking here for the past few months, trying to work up the courage to put myself out there.\n\nThis is my story of what happened to me (I wrote this out several weeks after the event, as a means of trying to come to terms with it and get my feelings out, so I'm sorry if it is a bit of a rant):\n\nA couple of months ago, I was put in a situation where I was essentially ambushed by people who I thought were my friends. It started with a get-together, which I expected to be a conversation about how everyone was doing.\n\nThen, suddenly, it became a confrontation with a particular individual. One of the sharpest memories I have is of her laughter, laughing at me. That laughter had teeth. It said she didn't care about me, that I was nothing, and that's when I knew that this was an ambush. She was like a cat who just wanted to torment her prey. I told her how I felt, this person, who had treated me horribly for months (purposefully ignoring me, belittling me, laughing at me, and hurting my relationships with others) for reasons unknown to me, who had made my anxiety and depression worse than it had been in a long time. It was obvious that she wasn't listening. She smirked, she rolled her eyes, she laughed. She was waiting to pounce. I was told to \"listen to her point of view because she had listened to me.\" That was a lie. She didn't listen, and she had no intention to. I don't remember a lot of our \"conversation.\" The explanation given by this person for their actions had to do with one or more interactions we had more than a year ago, which were *never* addressed with me; in fact I had no idea that there was any issue. At this point I had spent months agonizing over the decline of our friendship, staying awake at night wondering what I had done to deserve being made an outcast. I was told that was a terrible friend (by this person and others present, all speaking from their side) and essentially that I was wrong to think otherwise. When I came back in (I had left to try to compose myself), intending to apologize, again, for unintentionally hurting this person. However, when I re-entered the room, the five people still remaining cornered me and began to tell me that I was a terrible friend and person, and that I was wrong and twisted and bigoted. I was already visibly distressed at the end of the first confrontation, and this second wave was so unexpected that I felt like I couldn't move.\n\nAt some point in this \"conversation\" it got to the point where the people involved were laughing and cheering each other on, all making a constant stream of words that tore me apart, made me feel like every piece of who I am was being twisted and ripped from me. I was literally against a wall, cornered, as the people I thought were my friends ripped away at me. The only thing anchoring me, preventing me from internally combusting was my boyfriend and best friend, also completely shocked, who was there right next to me. I felt like I had knives being driven into my body, and twisted. I felt so much pain, and I knew that it didn't matter anything I said or did, because they wouldn't listen. At one point, I started scratching the skin on my hand with my nails. I couldn't block out what they were saying, but I thought maybe I could let out some of the pain I was feeling. Maybe if I physically hurt myself they would stop. They didn't stop. Eventually some other people came back into the room and there was a break in the barrage of awful things. One of the people involved wanted to go get something to eat and come back later, in an hour, to continue. The idea of continuing this made me feel like I might die. I managed to find the words to say \"No\" and tell my boyfriend that I needed to go. When we walked out, I said \"nice talking to you guys.\" It was an automatic response, and of course it was a lie. I barely made it ten feet outside before I started hyperventilating and bawling. We walked back to my room and I collapsed on my bed. If my boyfriend hadn't been there to hold me, I think I might have split into tiny pieces.\n\nIn the weeks and months since this event, I have had persistent nightmares and times when I relive parts of what happened over and over again in my head. Sometimes thoughts or memories will pop out of nowhere and I find myself feeling awful all over again. My memory of what happened, and the order of things, is mixed up. Sometimes, especially in the first couple weeks after it happened, something that reminds me of it, either the people involved, the things said, etc. suddenly makes me feel unsafe. Often when this happens, I start to feel kind of fuzzy and stare off into space\/not be all the way \"there\".  \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I don't know if I even have the right to be here in this sub. I'm just scared and sad and have lost my sense of self. I lost a big part of my support system at once, friends-wise, and I feel very alone in a lot of ways. I don't know if what I'm going through is normal, or even PTSD, but I know that what happened changed my whole \"me\" in ways I have never experienced before.

This is where it got very bad, he was very sadistic and verbally, physically and psychologically abusive. He told me he was intentionally trying to make me go crazy, and he would just stand there and smile and taunt me when he got me to the point of crying. He talked about ways to kill me, and weird things like splitting my mind and making me reborn and being one of the \"elite\" by being tortured. Just really insane and confusing and he kept me in a constant state of anxiety to the point where I would have panic attacks when he wasn't home, especially after I found him hiding in the pantry when I thought he had left... he was physically abusive as well but it went deeper than the \"normal\" abuse because he would have a totally different voice, different face everything when he would talk about that weird stuff it literally scared me to my core because it was like being talked to by a demon... and he made me feel so dehumanized and worthless, he told me there were all these things wrong with me and I developed a fear of going outside which lead to me being trapped in the apartment with him for 7 months. I believe he drugged me as well as revenge for having him put in jail but that is a whole other long and horrible story. All of this happened in a short period of time. \n\nMy memory is really messed up when it comes to all of that. I don't know exactly when it began, and there are huge chunks of time missing. I actually had a point where I just \"woke up\" but I was sitting in my bed, I didn't remember ANYTHING for several minutes and even as things came back to me, I had this horrible weird feeling like my name and my room were not mine. I didn't know what I was doing before that and my bed and the furniture were moved and I still don't remember moving anything. I have never understood that but when this happened I returned to the abusive guy (I was all alone, as an addict he was the ONLY person who still talked to me and at that point I was convinced that I was crazy and none of the things he did happened) and he acted all emotional and told me some weird stuff about how it finally happened and that \"Caeley #1\" has died and I was now \"Caeley #2\". It made me feel more alone and terrified and I now wonder about the possibility of having DID (I had traumatic things happen as a child) or if it's part of PTSD and depersonalization\/derealization disorder I've been diagnosed with. \n\nAnother thing I wonder about is why I am so emotionally detached from my memories. I remember it like it happened to someone else and I was watching, not like it happened to me. It makes me wonder if I even have PTSD at all. I only hear about people with PTSD being fearful and crying and everything but I am not like that, yet it still affects me and my life in other ways. Until recently (I think having a baby has changed it) I was unable to cry. I talk about it constantly, I think about it constantly, but it's the same memories over and over and I feel nothing when I think about them, just disturbed by the lack of feeling. I feel like not feeling anything makes it even harder to move past it... it's like I'm stuck. Like I blocked out the emotions then when they got too horrible to deal with and then I just stayed like that. I cry about other things, I feel love and everything but I'm totally detached from the memories. I factually know how I felt then. I know I was in absolute despair and so much pain but like someone else TOLD me how they felt. \n\nWhen I talk about this stuff, I do not feel any anxiety at all, but my back tightens up and I begin shaking and getting cold, every time. When I'm talking about it out loud, if I go on too long the tightness in my back spreads through my body and makes it hard for me to breathe and I have to stop talking. Once I stop talking about it, it goes away. It has made it difficult for me to explain everything to a therapist. It's very weird and I'm serious when I say I do not feel the anxiety whatsoever when I talk about it... it's just my body reacting that way. When I was typing what happened, I got those physical symptoms and when I started typing this, it faded away. Is it still PTSD if I am emotionally detached from the memories? Is there a type of therapist or someone that can help me connect to those memories and move past it? I was seeing a counselor in my home town but I got married and moved, and she wasn't helping any way because she didn't understand what I meant when I told her about the detachment. I just really need peace, and to move on. I feel like I'm just trapped in these memories until I feel like they were real... as weird as I know that sounds. I hope someone out there understands.

He offered to let me ride on the cart for a little bit for fun, which I did, got off, and went back inside. My entire life, whenever I remember this, I just remember feeling very uneasy, distrustful of this random man. And the memory of it was something that would come in my head at least once a week ever since then. I am pretty sure he was there for some purpose for the wedding, but it was never established when I had met this man. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout a year ago, something odd started to happen. One day, while I was remembering it, the way I thought of the memory changed. Instead of me simply riding on top of a goat pulled cart, it was me and this girl who was around my age riding on it together, and at some point I jumped off of the cart, sensing that something was up. And it ended with the man shooting the girl in the head, and then shooting at me as I ran away back into my uncle's house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis \"new version\" of that memory just popped in my head out of no where one day last year. And ever since, whenever I remember that memory, I can barely picture what the \"original\" memory was, and instead I picture the version that recently came.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Some facts about Pakistan: Many children are kidnapped and forced to do things like beg on the streets, many children are sold into labour by their parents. In fact, that same trip to Pakistan I ran into this group of children who had their eyes cut out, finger(s) cut off, etc, clearly by whoever kidnapped them, and they were begging for money (Obviously for their kidnappers.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if in reality I luckily escaped a kidnapping attempt, and my brain recreated a \"substitute\" memory in place of the other one? Or am I just being crazy? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"},{"id":"2602_counseling","text":"I've been feeling worthless, unaccomplished, and so frustrated.

She's about 2 years older than me, and we were always very nerdy, we would play as star trek characters or something and run around outside, sometimes we'd play as Mario characters. I was the younger sibling so I'd always get stuck playing the boy bc sis wanted to play as a girl. Eventually the Mario playing turned sexual, but here's the thing, we never actually touched each other, it would always be one of us just sitting on the other and stuff like that. It's very rare for me to remember things that happened to me when I was a child because of how badly I was bullied and beaten in school. (A kid damaged my eye so badly that my vision is damaged for life and I have to wear glasses.) This leads me to believe u have ptsd because I block out like all of school from my memories. Anyway, the events with sis went on until I was probably 12 or 13, her being 14-16. I'm 16 now and I can't imagine thinking its acceptable to play with a kid in that way.

I pushed that memory deep into my brain and just tried to forget about it and was doing alright until recently. My boyfriend (same boyfriend as mentioned above) and I got into a bit of a messy situation and he was quite mad at me for understandable reasons but suddenly decided he wanted to have sex with me while he was angry and I... felt vulnerable and scared. I didn't say 'no' but I was shaking and crying and I would've assumed that situation was in NO way a situation where sex could've arised from... after that experience I felt traumatised again which brought up past memories and I could not stop shaking so I went to a psychologist 2 days later and he prescribed me with medication to help me get through the day. This was a little over 2 months ago and I'm still taking medication. \n\n**NOW for the question.** Flashbacks are a major part of what people with PTSD have to go through, but I want to know what your flashback experiences are like. \n\nFor me, personally, I feel like my flashbacks aren't as bad as what other people make theirs out to be so I feel quite confused about my PTSD. I end up doubting myself on whether I even have a mental illness but then I go through periods of ups and downs where I feel scared, anxious, and cry from fear when down. But it's not like I feel like the whole experience is happening again... It's just the feelings that come. It's also weird because I feel much better when my boyfriend is with me, (yes I'm still with him but I'm not here for advice on my relationship) and have these 'feelings' or 'experiences' when I'm not with him. The only times where I really think about what happened that day or with my step dad years ago is when I'm talking to my psychologist about it and I try to keep it repressed at other times. \n\nWhy do I keep doubting my PTSD? But then while doubting my PTSD, I also worry that getting off these pills (diazepam, lexapro, valium...) will make me go insane. Are overwhelming feelings also a part of flashbacks?   \n\nTL;DR\n\nmy flashbacks don't really feel like the event is happening again but is rather an overwhelming sense of feelings of anxiety, fear, and crying - is this a part of flashbacks? what are your flashbacks like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny feedback would be great.

Hi \/r\/PTSD, first time visitor here. \n\nMy GF has recently been given a definitive diagnosis of PTSD after several runarounds with different doctors\/psychiatrists and I'm looking for pointers on how to help alleviate any pressures or triggers for her, and maybe help her symptoms improve, if possible. \n\nShe's been the victim of sexual assaults on two different occasions and her dad was physically abusive when she and her siblings were young(he was FOB at the time and has softened since, not that I'm excusing him - his actions affect her to this day). On top of this there is a history of depression in her family, which she seems to have inherited, so her moods can be very dark even when she's not triggered. It's hard to know what's what she's suffering from.\n\nShe's been trying different anti-depressants since she was 19, when she started having trouble with school. About 2 years ago she admitted to being suicidal after her previous relationship ended(we had met but weren't a couple yet). She was taken in and seen by a panel of psychiatrists\/doctors who asked her loads of questions and then released her, not really doing anything or giving her any info - she says it was a horrible experience. Her family doctor has sent her to a few different specialists since, all who do an interview with her before bouncing her back to family doctor saying they're not qualified. \n\nThe most recent doctor, a CBT specialist, listened to her about how fed up she was with the lack of progress, he looked through her previous files and interviewed some of the professionals she'd previously seen and was able to find that she'd been given a PTSD diagnosis, which is a step in the right direction, but as a CBT specialist he's not qualified for PTSD so he shunted her back to her doctor. So we're back to waiting for her doctor to find someone who's qualified to help her. We've made progress finally but it's been a pain in the arse.\n\nShe's in college for the third time now, after dropping out twice from different courses. For the first time, yesterday and today, she's had trouble leaving the house to go to her new course. Completing school is very important to her but she's so debilitated she can't get out of the bed\/chair to do anything, and I'm in work so I can't give physical comfort\/encouragement. She's just sitting, stuck to the spot by panic\/sadness. When it's happened before I've asked questions about where the sadness\/panic comes from and she says she doesn't know - which makes it hard for me to give her any kind of solace other than that I love her and am there for her. I want to help more but I can't think of anything else that could help and I'm afraid the pattern that's stopped her from sticking out college before will happen again.   \n\nShe's on Wellbutrin for the day and Seroquel for the night. I'm not delighted about the latter because it's so heavy but it does the job so I'm not saying anything...\n\nI support her, I try to be there for her, I try to be emotionally present and not fatigued with the constant roadblocks. I try to vet media for content that could trigger her and I keep an eye on her in social situations in case I see her start to fade\/get triggered.. I'm fine with it even if it's hard sometimes.\n\nIs there anything I'm not doing\/could be doing\/should stop doing? \nThank you."},{"id":"2655_incel","text":" So getting into heaven is based on randomness and luck.

My girlfriend has had PTSD since she was a teenager and has come a long way in her mental and emotional health. I try my best to understand and be supportive. It can be hard to always understand though. We have excellent communication and openly talk about mistakes we make and when we feel hurt by each other. It seems she often pins her mistakes on being in 'fight or flight mode'. There are a lot of circumstances where this is understandable and having been raised by a verbally abusive dad I can relate to an extent. However, it's hard to understand when a simple question, or text message, awkward situation sends her into fight or flight. \n\nI can't help but wonder how much of what is triggering is legitimate and if she's using fight or flight as an excuse for her behavior. This is difficult because of the level of maturity we strive to have in our relationship. On my end, it feels like she thinks that every mistake she makes must be because she's in fight or flight. Some of the situations sound like things that I and others have a hard time with too, but learn to recognize and deal with. It feels like she's not trying to overcome her difficulties by handicapping herself with fight or flight and other PTSD related issues. \n\nI really want to understand and help her. If PTSD is simply that difficult to deal with I want to know so that I can understand her perspective better and be patient. But if this is a crutch she's leaning on too much, I want to help her take steps to empower herself and move forward with her life and healing. \n\nMy question is, does having PTSD send you into fight or flight over little things frequently? If so, how have you found is the best way to heal from that response? What do you recommend I do to better support my girlfriend? \n\nEdit: the bein in the title should be being. \n\nEdit 2: Thank you all for your input. It's helpful to see more perspectives and how you each deal with your PTSD. Thank you for sharing. From what you've said it looks like PTSD can trigger fight or flight frequently from what may seem to be little things. I want to clarify, I made this post because I want to do my best to be supportive for her. I'm committed to helping her with her mental and emotional health goals however I can. I'm going to do my best to talk to her about her triggers and just listen as much as I can. Thank you again for the suggestions. I hope you all continue to heal and have the support you need from loved ones. :)"},{"id":"2657_ptsd","text":"Would you expose your childhood abuser?

CONTENT\/TRIGGER WARNING: Detailed story of child abuse, near-death experiences, guns, animal death\n\nI have PTSD from childhood abuse from my step-father (who I was raised to believe was my biological father) and from my mother who neglected me a lot throughout my life until I moved out.\n\nI haven't lived with my mom and step-dad since 2011 and I still have vivid nightmares and flashbacks from my childhood.\n\nOne thing that I'd like to share with you all is a certain situation my step-dad put my family in. It was 2012, I was living with my grandparents, but went to Chuck E. Cheese with my mom, step-dad, and brother because my mom wanted me to go with them.\nEverything was going okay until we left and got inside my step-dad's truck.\n\nMy step-dad has a permit to open carry a pistol, which I still have no idea how he was able to even get that gun, but then again, 'murrica. He caries that damn thing with him everywhere.\n\nAnyways, we were all sitting in the truck, step-dad in driver's seat, mom in passenger seat, and my brother and me in the backseat. Out of the blue, my step-dad locks the doors of the vehicle and takes out his pistol. As soon as I saw him do this, I just thought to myself, \"great, we're all going to die now.\" He pointed the barrel at our heads, smiling and waving his gun around like it was a toy. He almost never keeps the safety on.\n\n\"I could kill all of you right now, just put a bullet in all of your heads,\" he said, laughing, still waving the gun around.\n\n\"(S-D's name), please stop, you're scaring us!\" My mom cried.\n\nHe pointed the gun at her and told her, \"shut the fuck up!\"\n\nThen my mom said, \"this is why OP doesn't want to be around us anymore!\"\n\nMy step-dad groaned and put away his pistol, claiming that my mom always has to \"ruin the fun\" and then drove me back to my grandparents' house.\n\nAbout a year after he had gotten the gun (back in 2009), I was sitting in the living room watching War of the Worlds. Suddenly, he just pulled his pistol out in the living room, stood up, pointed the gun at me, and pulled the trigger. I screamed so loud and tried to cover myself up. I remember the feeling of the adrenaline rushing through my veins and feeling so helpless. Then, I heard him laugh at me and said, \"OP, stop being fucking ridiculous, the magazine's not even in!\"\n\nWell, he ended up accidentally killing his dog back in 2012. He took his sleeping pills before cleaning out his gun. The magazine was out, but there was a bullet stuck in the chamber. He accidentally pulled the trigger. It went straight through his arm chair and hit his dog in the head. She yelped slightly and tried to walk away before she slumped down and passed on. Luckily, I didn't have to witness that situation first hand (my mother had told me when I asked where the dog was when I was visiting her once).\n\nThat's not the only abusive thing that he's done, but it's been replaying in my mind ever since the school shooting in Florida.\n\nThe only ones I've told these stories to are my boyfriend, a couple trusted friends, and two therapists.\n\nIt terrifies me whenever people ask me how I feel about gun control. I feel like they will think I'm being ridiculous when I tell them I support stricter gun regulations, but honestly, if an abusive man with mental illness can LEGALLY get a firearm and threaten to shoot his family, pretend to shoot his own kid, and accidentally kill his dog with it, there should obviously be some sort of stricter regulations.\n\nI haven't reported him. I've always been afraid to. My mom would always tell me as a child to not tell ANYONE that he abused me because she didn't want her kids taken away from her. That's still engraved in my brain, even to this day. Even the thought of reporting him gives me waves of anxiety.\n\nHe still has that gun and he still is legally allowed to open-carry.

The place was horrible and caused me a lot of trauma. The staff were abusive and gave me so much medication that on my 8th day of being there i only thought it was my 3rd day due to how out of it i was.\nSo, for the most part i barely remember everything that happened there but sometimes i get random flashbacks to moments I either blocked out or didn't remember due to the medication.\n\nOne I recently remembered happened around my last day there. The only reason I left was due to the fact that i had a melt down during visitations and my family forced me out of the hospital, by now I'm questioning if this was one of the things that caused my tipping point.\n\nI have bad psoriasis, it was especially bad back then. Covered 75-80% of my body, so i constantly had to use medicine. The staff would give me it after taking my pills and I'd go to a private room by myself to apply it.\nWell, near the last day a nurse didn't hand it to me but instead took it, brought me to a different room, took my shirt and pants off without warning, then started applying it to my body. She then went on to go underneath my underwear to apply it onto my backside.\n\nI was too confused and dazed to really do anything or tell her I was uncomfortable because the medication instantly hit me with drowsiness\/fuzziness but i remember feeling humiliated and shocked by it.\n\nShe was a female nurse, kind of sweet but could be very rude at times.

I had it before I joined and have been struggling my whole life since my accident. I looked into it, and what I found  is if I were to get disability for ptsd, I can\u2019t work.  Or I can\u2019t make more than a certain amount a month. Am I wrong? Is this the way it is? Please tell me I am wrong. I can still work my $75,000 a year job now. That is why I\u2019m not seeking help or anything because I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it. If I could get what the veterans are getting I would go seek help and get on disability.

Really, really struggling.\n\nIt's been years, maybe 15 years since my NCO shot himself. My search team found him. Great dude. A real brotherly authority figure. Trying to not think too much about that.\n\nI never thought that that could have been the reason for my decline after leaving the military. Depression, isolation, numbness, severe dissociation, feelings of dread and doom (which I didn't know until very recently is anxiety), can't stand a certain smell of forest etc, constantly think \"If he killed himself being the fucking champion he was. What chance do I have?\", self harmed for a year after I left the army which concluded in a suicide attempt which left a huge scare over my chest which also reminds me. \n\nNever thought anything about it, I could not see my own problems and when I did I didn't link it to PTSD as \"I haven't experienced anything traumatic\". Just pushing anything related to that away subconsciously. The psychologist said that they called it \"the evading illness\" internally as it's extremely common to just block it all and say that you are fine.\n\nWell, you people know all that. \n\nI don't know. I just had to write something about it that says \"hey this happened\" to myself. Between this and the surgery I'm struggling to find the will to go on.

Tw: abuse, self-gaslighting, sexual assault, manipulation (basically all types of abuse), mention of people never coming to terms with abuse\n\n.\n\n(Idk whether I actually am gaslighting myself but important to include that Tw regardless)\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe situation I'm in - I'm 21, at university, and I'm honestly shocked at how shitty lots of my peers can be to each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's bullying and have been instances of public shaming which I believe fall under the label of \"emotional abuse\". I know a couple who I think are in an abusive relationship (the woman abusing the man), and I believe certain sentiments within my community normalise female-on-male abuse. I believe that one of my past romantic relationships has been emotionally abusive, I believe that as a kid I was sometimes abused by my Dad, I believe that when I was 18 men tried to manipulate me into sex. I believe that I've abused myself. I believe that I was sexually assaulted in my first year of university..... and then again in my second year..... and then again in my third. I believe that a member of staff sexually harassed me. I believe that in my environment, abuse and inappropriate behaviour between staff and students are normalised. I believe that on my first week there, someone spiked my drink. I believe I faced harassment from other students when I held a student politics position. I believe my housemate emotionally lashed out at me and maybe thought about me in an abusive way. I believe I have a friend who's emotionally abused me (the same one that I think abuses her boyfriend), and that her best friend enabled it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd this just leads me to ask myself - am I the problem???\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think in some ways I have been unlucky - for whatever reason, I've experienced more mistreatment than average. I think I (wittingly and unwittingly) can put myself in vulnerable situations - like with the student political position, I knew I'd feel very anxious about it and take people's criticisms to heart, but I did it anyway partly cos I felt I'd have to, and partly cos I thought I'd do a good job. And then with my friend who I think abused me, I guess I did see the red flags and (for whatever reason) chose to ignore them, because I thought I could control\/handle it. Same with the abusive ex coming to think of it. So maybe it's that I don't avoid these situations enough?? (Could my trauma have desensitised me to certain warning signs?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then part of me also thinks, is it about how I'm interpreting situations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 17 I went through a highly traumatic series of events, and I was only able to recover by recognising and understanding abuse. I'd experienced things like gaslighting, I became aware of common misconceptions people have - I guess I had to learn about abuse \/ healthy relationships on a logical level, before going on to experience them, because my trauma had been so bad and completely messed up the way I viewed relationships? So I had to reform my ideas step by step using logic\/principles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there's two ways of looking at this - awareness and projection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's definitely true that I see abuse where others don't. Also I don't \\*always\\* mean it as such a seriously bad thing - I mean obviously it's unacceptable, does have a negative impact, and needs to be stopped. But I don't think \"traumatic\" or \"super emotionally damaging\" are prerequisites (though they obviously often come with it) - I think it's just a significant violation of someone's boundaries in a way that doesn't have a reasonable explanation, accompanied by gaslighting or denial (though gaslighting doesn't need to be there when it's severe). So say with my ex - I feel like the emotional manipulation was traumatic, but the specific individual instances of sexual abuse (and the gaslighting that came with those) wasn't traumatic and didn't need to be to \"count\" as abusive?\n\nI can think of someone or a situation as \"abusive\" without thinking it defines them as a person, they'd act like that in all contexts, or that they were consciously meaning to do harm. Whereas I think a lot of people my age use it to describe only very serious \/ extreme behaviour - and people who they think are \"bad\". They're reluctant to identify abuse in those they like \/ love \/ are able to empathise with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it that they're 21, and in denial, and experiencing all the rationalisations and justifications that abused people &amp; witnesses typically do? Is it that a lot of people receive a certain level of abuse, but never \\*need\\* to come to terms with it, because it doesn't escalate, and it never impacts then \\*that much\\*? Is it that they are significantly impacted, and some of them will never come to terms with it (i.e. permanently impacted), but most people will learn and see recognising destructive behaviour (for what it is) as a process they went through in their 20s?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr is it that I'm projecting? I went through a really horrible experience when I was 17. My formative examples of mistreatment are labuse, so is it hard for me to see any type of mistreatment as non-abusive? Black and white approach?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not as if I consider all my friends to be abusive - I have many friends who I don't consider to be abusive. Some of them have mistreated me, but because they've apologised or I've clearly seen it was their fault, I haven't really interpreted it as abusive? And there have been times I've been hurt or disappointed in the past in ways which I consider non-abusive (thinking about it though, instances of abuse do seem to heavily outweigh instances of non-abusive harm when I think about my life experiences).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm generally not a fan of \"everyone else is the problem\", but to me, my interpretations of each experience makes sense, and I've often thought about it a lot? Is it just that I reflect more on things??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk if I'm just sensitive? Do I feel abused by others so easily bc I'm so impacted by them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know no one here can answer these questions, but if you're able to provide insight from your own experiences, I'd really appreciate it?"},{"id":"2685_ptsd","text":"(Trigger warning) the memory barrier I built of my childhood started collapsing last week after watching a movie. This is a bit of a rant and probably horribly structured \n\nI watched the movie honey boy and the similarities broke down the memory wall I built. My mental health had hit critical about two years ago, I was diagnosed with complex ptsd with suicidal ideation, which I had known for awhile it was most likely that. I started going to therapy, I quit drinking and doing drugs, started medication again, things have been getting better slowly. Now the wall is down, memories and emotions started flooding in, flashbacks started again, suicidal ideation started more frequently ( I will never go through with it) and for the life of me I can't seem to understand how bad my situation was growing up, I know it was wrong and not normal but something is blocking me from viewing it rationally. It was just my life, I have no other perspective or anything I can compare it to.  I'm more writing this out to just to get it out so... Here we go\n\nMy first memory of my father was when I was 2 to 4, my mom was leaving for work, he was hungover I'm assuming and I was crying staring out the window because she was leaving me, I didn't stop after she left, I remember my dad had his hand on his face not looking well, barley attempting to calm me down when he grabbed my pj shirt and slapped me across the face, the memory ends there. Typically he would use a belt or a metal shoe horn, he didn't get more physical until I was older but that is maybe my first memory of my childhood that comes to mind. Everything is fuzzy but that one is clear as day. I would run away from him when I would get in trouble and he would chase me around the house snapping his leather belt over and over until he caught me and would then beat me bare ass with it, I can't remember the pain or even being hit with the belt, I just remember the before it happened. I do remember I would become hysterical often but I can't clear up andly specific memories, I just feel the emotion and I know it happened often. \n\nThe next portion of memories start when I thought my parents, mainly my dad, my mom was never abusive, would turn into wear wolves when I would turn my back, everytime I turned around I thought they were sneaking up on me claws over their heads about to eat me, I would often follow them around and try to catch them, I had a fear of being alone because I always thought they were going to get me if I wasn't paying attention. this continued until around 10 or 11, I don't know why that thought process stopped but it just did.\n\nI know my dad was also verbally abusive but I can't really remember specifics I just know it happened often. Things like don't be a pussy or don't be such a girl with the occasional smack upside the head and such. I was a very sensitive child and wished i had been a girl, maybe because my sister didn't get it as bad as I did, I'm not 100% sure why those thoughts started so early but they were vivid.\n\nAround 9 the abuse started changing and progressing into more abrubt violence, less spankings more being thrown against walls and choked although I can remember only two times this happened I wouldn't be suprised if it was more often, smacks across the head, the verbal abuse escalated into more of a bully harassing way, he would do things to just tease or torment me, specific memories are hard to clear up enough to get a good picture, I remember one time he showed me a pressure point on my foot and refused to let go, I was crying it hurt so bad and ended up hitting him in the face and then he lost his temper idk stuff like that. The inappropriate behavior of exposing me to adult things like porn and inappropriate movies, letting me drink a beer or some wine, no sexual abuse I can remember so that's a relief. I started being more aware of his behavior and knowing he was wrong most of the time , I didn't like the way he would treat people in public, he was very racist, he would often put my mom down, they divorced when I was 7. I also started talking back more and challenging him and he seemed to for the most part loose interest in me, I would often leave the house and spend most of the day with friends in the neighborhood. I had very little parental oversight at this point after the divorce and would mainly fend for myself most of the time. By 8 or 9 during summers I was mostly left to do what I wanted, my sister was there but she was a teen and barley kept tabs on me.\n\nMy suicidal ideation started around 11 In middle school where I was bullied a lot, the change in the social behavior didn't really click for me until around 8th grade when I taught myself how to be accepted. I started drinking often on weekends in 8th grade, smoking cigarettes by 9th I discovered weed and that was my miracle cure, I couldn't stand ever not being high or drunk and almost all of high-school was just one big party that lasted 10 years too long. I was lucky I never enjoyed the harder stuff besides my love of cocain but it never became too much of an issue. At 15 the end of my relationship with my father happened, he picked me up from school when I was sick and we got in a fight where he punched me several times in the face and I jumped from his moving car, he never got in trouble for it, my mom and sister begged me not to press charges and that was pretty much the end of my relationship with them as well, since the defended him, my sister took his side and my mom who is a push over just wanted the drama to go away and kept trying to get me to forgive him, I lost all respect for either of them and realized I was on my own. That pretty much set up my teen years of balls to the wall not thinking I would live past 18 and to be honest I'm pretty suprised I did, multiple arrests and forced rehab probably ended up saving me. \n\nI don't know how to feel about all of this, there isn't an emotion to describe any of it, it just makes me feel sick to my stomach.

Twice as many women have reproduced as men, on average, but that counts historical periods of enforced monogamy.  In periods without culturally or legally enforced monogamy about 1 male reproduced for every 8 women.  Post tinder, it is certainly worse, or getting worse.  So biology plays it safe with women.  Their development gives them a high probability of being intelligent enough to leech off society and men, but doesn't take risks on biology that could develop extra intelligence (and other capabilities).  The top men get all the women, so biology does high stakes gambling with the development of men.  Male biology is such that rarely under certain environmental conditions they will become Chad, but mostly they will become incels.  Any genetic line that didn't evolve this, would result in many average men that did not reproduce.  So back to women.  Because they do not have the energy capacity (lung capacity, heart capacity, etc. ), let alone intelligence to acquire substantial resources on their own they must leach of society and men.  Their evolved instinct is also to gather resources for their offspring (modern equivalent is shopping).  In the animal kingdom a good equivalent is the spider.  The female spider will eat the male after sex.  The male doesn't know this is going to happen.  This is the nature of the female to acquire resources for their offspring at the expense of men.  As far as morality, women can not survive on their own.  This is why they derive their \"moral\" impulses entirely from the tribe.  They don't possess the capacity to start a new tribe either.  In the modern globally connected gynocentric culture, with high rate information evolution, this results in memes (mind viruses) decoupling from reality and hyper-evolving far past the point of insanity, being perpetuated by female minds.  Male minds can not put this in check, because of women's desire for status, their impulses have made them the masters of the internet, and the internet has become the backbone of global culture, which has resulted an irreversible global insanity.  Other factors such as economic incentives and tragedy of the commons feed off this and amplify it.  What I find most interesting out of all of this is that males for the most part have lived in complete obliviousness to female nature.

Haven't posted in r\/ptsd, but this came up. \n\n# Family Makeup\n\n(If you want to get to the question at hand without my life story, just skip to the heading \"The Dilemma\")\n\nI am from a large family. Middle child of 7.\n\nI never really knew my father (for the best, really. I have zero desire to know him), because he was sent to prison (rightfully so) when I was very young. Before I can remember, honestly. But my brother and I were his sons. My parents had 3 other children before us, my 3 older half-siblings (I rarely call them half-siblings, only for clarity sake when detailing family histories). This story really doesn't include my older half-siblings for the most part, only briefly. They are 10, 9, and 4 years older than me.\n\nWhen I was 2 or 3, my mother met and married a new man, we will call him Harry (his name was not Harry). And they had a daughter together, my younger half-sister. So, my younger brother, younger sister, and I were all born within 3.5 years of each other, my younger half-sister being 3.5 years younger than me.  My father also had another daughter when I was 13. So, my siblings and I range in birth years from 1975 to 2003.\n\nBut really, this story focuses on me, my younger full-brother (11 months younger than me), my younger half-sister (3.5 years younger than me), my mother, and my step-father.\n\n# The Wretched Brothers (TW: Physical and Verbal\/Emotional Abuse)\n\nSo, my step-father would abuse my brother and me, a lot. Every night. He was an alcoholic, and would often beat my brother and me, along with more severe physical abuse (&gt;!burning us with cigarettes and coffee irons, pushing us down the stairs, locking us in the basement, forcing us to sleep on tiles floors underneath a pool table.... so much. We would have bruises and burns that we had to hide from school officials. !&lt;). Not only did he physically abuse my brother and me, he also abused our mother in similar ways. The infraction could be as mundane as ... well nothing. Sometimes, I am convinced he just did these things because he enjoyed to see us suffer. Honestly. Because we would do absolutely nothing, but get punished for it. Spilled milk? Punished. Breathed too loudly? Punished. Sat in the corner minding our own business? Punished. And by \"punished,\" I mean the abuse that I have hidden under spoiler tags.\n\nBut, though the physical abuse was intense, the emotional\/verbal abuse was much, much worse. A bruise can heal, but the things he said to us affected our whole lives. This was much more than just being overly critical or saying hurtful things now-and-then. This was constant. He would call us the worse things imaginable. He refused to let us go anywhere because he said that we were thieves (we weren't). Every night, he would angrily tell us how worthless we were, calling us the most vile names. We were locked in the basement when company was over because we would \"embarrass him.\"\n\nNow, looking back to when I was a kid, from what I remember, we were pretty much like every other child (I had some bizarre idiosyncrasies, but my brother was completely normal, honestly). And asking people who knew us from that time, we were regarded as pretty delightful children, who weren't prone to mischief more so than any other child. Actually, we were described as timid and respectful.\n\nBasically, the abuse did not match our behavior. And even if we were the terrifically unruly children that he said we were, we didn't deserve *that.*\n\nAlongside the physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, there was also neglect. We didn't have beds, and were forced to sleep on the tile floor under the pool table. We rarely got the clothes we needed, having to wear clothes that we obviously had outgrew. And, for a time, we were homeless and couldn't get food. Much of this was due to abject poverty, but even when we weren't in dire straits, we were still not afforded the necessities. This also falls somewhat on my mother, but that is unfair to blame her for any of this, which I will expound upon later.\n\n# The Golden Child\n\nI suspect you saw this coming. My brother and I were abused and neglected, and my younger half-sister could do no wrong. Now, of course, she was his daughter. And in many ways, she was raised as if she was an only child. While my brother, my mother, and I were relegated to the basement floor, my half-sister lived a life of privilege upstairs. She got all the newest clothes. She had her own room with a bed. She got anything she ever wanted. And, growing up in a household like this, I assumed this is just how life was. Boys were treated like trash, and girls were treated like royalty. It made sense at the time, I suppose (mind you, I was under 12).\n\nI cannot tell you how many times my brother and I would be punished for something my sister did. We would *watch* our sister do something terrible, then blame it on us, and we would get punished. Then our mother\/step-father would praise her for being brave enough to tell! It was infuriating!!! No matter how much my brother and I protested and told the truth, no one believed us. My sister laughs about this to this day.\n\nNow, looking back she too was being abused, just in a different way. The favorite(s) is(are) being abused just as much as the scapegoat(s). It is just a different dynamic.\n\nTo illustrate how different our lives were, my older half-sister on my father's side would call to talk to my brother and me. We weren't allowed to talk to her, but my younger half-sister would have full conversation with her. I didn't find this out until I was an adult, and my older half-sister told me. No one told us that my older half-sister called us ever. But, every time she called, she got to speak with my younger half-sister. Mind you, they are not related in any way (I suppose they share two half-brothers).\n\n# The Nightmare Ends\n\nFrom the time I was 3, until the time I was 12, this was my life (with a small respite when my mother finally got fed up with it all and left him for a few months). Nothing I did was good enough (a trait that has followed me throughout life). Daily being abused. Watching our sister live an entirely different life. And having nothing to compare it to, because to us, this was how things *are.* We didn't know it wasn't normal to be treated like this. It wasn't until maybe high school that I realized, \"Wow, people didn't live like this!\" But, it finally ended one day in October when I was 12.\n\nHarry died unexpectedly. I shed not a single tear. I was sad for my sister. I was somewhat sad for my mother. I was sad for Harry's parents. But, in almost all ways, I was relieved and happy he was dead. So was my brother. And I suspect, my mother was at least relieved he would no longer torture any of us.\n\nMy sister was 8 years old at the time.\n\n# My Dear Mother\n\nI love my mother. I feel like she did the best with what she had. She loved each of us intensely. She had an infectious laugh, and a caring spirit. She was a joy to be around. Most of the time.\n\nCounterintuitively, my most horrific memories have to do with my mother. You see, she was schizophrenic, and because of that, every single one of us children went through some awful experiences.\n\nNow, when she was not experiencing a psychotic episode, she was the loving, amazing woman we all adored. But during those true psychotic episodes (of which she had no control over, having breakthrough episodes even on her medication), I and my siblings experienced some of the most traumatic experiences of our lives. Later in life, while I was an adult, so more prepared to cope with the trauma, my mother once blew up her oxygen tank, setting fire to her assisted living facility. Throughout the years, she had numerous episodes.\n\nThis is why I rarely blame my mother for not doing enough to protect us and herself. She was scared herself. Harry, on more than one occasion, &gt;!threatened to kill her and my brother and me. My mother would tell us that she would often wake up with Harry strangling her in the middle of the night. Plus, he was a hunter, and kept her gunpoint - metaphorically.!&lt; Add this with her underlying mental illness, and it is very difficult to assign any blame to my mother. She couldn't work, and at the time, she couldn't get on disability either. The one time she did find the courage to leave Harry, we ended up starving, freezing, and homeless. And then Harry came to stay with us while homeless, before eventually moving us to his car, then his parent's motorhome, and then finally.. the basement.\n\nSince my mother was in a vulnerable position (her mental health and having no income due to disability), it just seems like predatory men found her, and made her life (and her children's lives) miserable.\n\nIn my head, yes, the experiences were traumatic, but in the same way a hurricane or earthquake is traumatic. Who do you blame?\n\n# The Aftermath\n\nSo, now it is well over 20 years since Harry died. My mother passed in 2013 due to lung cancer\/COPD. I have spent years in therapy, trying to heal. Even tried to be a therapist myself (big mistake. Trigger. Trigger. Trigger. HOSPITAL!). I have lived with daily SI since probably the time I was 9, and have had nearly 20 psych hospitalizations throughout the last 20 years. I am living knowing that I survived quite an ordeal.\n\nBut, my brother did not survive Harry's abuse. He died by suicide when he was 17. Clearly, Harry wasn't the only trauma that we had experienced. Often times when my mother would have a psychotic episode, my brother and I would be shuffled in and out of foster care. Sometimes together, sometimes apart. One time we were put in juvenile detention because we were \"too old for foster care.\" We were 13 and 14. We had different privileges than everyone else because we weren't there for \"delinquency,\" which actually made us more of targets (we got treated differently by staff, so the other boys would beat us, and one &gt;!sexually assaulted us.!&lt;\n\nI got emancipated when I was 16. Had my own apartment. Went into the Army. Became an Army nurse. And here's the thing - basic training was *fun.* It was a breeze compared to what I had experienced earlier in life. Got out of the Army, went to college. Made a life as best as I could.\n\nBut even now, one thing still bugs me.\n\n# The Dilemma\n\nSo, now whenever I bring up Harry around my half-sister, she gets angry. She has said that I am exaggerating what happened, and that it wasn't that bad. I love my sister, and we are actually very close, but this is a real kicker.\n\nShe doesn't even acknowledge that her father did anything wrong. Which makes me question my own experiences. But it isn't like I am the only one saying these terrible things about her father. My mother confirmed what happened. My older siblings confirmed what happened. Even one of my half-sister's *cousins* confirmed what happened.\n\nWhich was oddly satisfying when I learned that her cousin confirmed the abuse. I was very active in church, and so during testimony, I would sometimes detail some of the experiences I had with Harry. I had a church mentor\/friend who thought I was exaggerating, because to her, it sounded so outrageous, it must not have happened.\n\nWell, I started working for this church mentor\/friend, and a few years later, we bring in a new employee. Without my permission, my boss\/mentor\/friend starts divulging my personal history to this new employee (yes, I realize how inappropriate this is). During the conversation the new employee thought it was weird how similar it was to the story of her aunt's and uncle's family house. Turns out, my half-sister is the employee's cousin once removed (my step-father is her cousin). She then goes on to inform my boss\/mentor\/friend how terrible the situation actually was, and that I might even have been minimizing what happened, definitely not exaggerating. This was a cousin who I was not even allowed to see because it would \"embarrass\" my step-father. Any time she would come to visit, we were locked in the basement.\n\nHow can my half-sister not acknowledge this? At least say something like \"I know my father was a complicated man, I still love him, but I abhor what he did to my two brothers.\" Or... anything? To her, \"Harry did nothing wrong, and the things he did do, y'all deserved it. And actually, it was our *mom* who messed us all up, not my dad.\"\n\nIt is hurtful and infuriating. To the point that we cannot talk about her dad at all.\n\nAnyone else experience this kind of gaslighting?"},{"id":"2695_ptsd","text":"Finally getting help I had some childhood trauma.  And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   \n\nI injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  \n\nWell the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  \n\nLuckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. \n\nI looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) \n\n When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  \n\nI went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a \"cookie cutter\" plan.\n\nThey explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. \n\nAfter going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  \n\nThey truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  \n\nThey also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    \n\nWith their help I have been clean 3.5 months.\n\nIt is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. \n\nSo today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.\n\nFor the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future.... And it gets brighter every day!!! \n\n(Pic of text from mmj doc)\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2ExSSv4.png"},{"id":"2696_counseling","text":"I have an eating disorder of binging.
