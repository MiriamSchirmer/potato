A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.   The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.   My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn\u2019t stand with out pain. \nFor the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back.  I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.    I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.   I felt numb and anxious I\u2019d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn\u2019t go in I\u2019d feel guilty for not going in.  But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn\u2019t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.   I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone. \nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol.  Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.   When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd.  I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time\n\nIv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can\u2019t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.   Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them.  I don\u2019t really talk in therapy session and the reply\u2019s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.

I'd experienced things like gaslighting, I became aware of common misconceptions people have - I guess I had to learn about abuse / healthy relationships on a logical level, before going on to experience them, because my trauma had been so bad and completely messed up the way I viewed relationships?
