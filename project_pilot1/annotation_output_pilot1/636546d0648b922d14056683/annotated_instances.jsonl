I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.

I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone. \nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol.
