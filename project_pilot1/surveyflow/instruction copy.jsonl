Each snippet may include references to potentially traumatic events or experiences, such as abuse, violence, or loss. If you find it difficult to judge a particular snippet, you can select \"uncertain\". Your ratings will help us understand how trauma is perceived in different textual contexts and will contribute to developing an automated system for identifying and flagging such content. For the best experience, please ensure your browser window is maximized to full screen. You can use the left and right arrow keys to navigate between snippets.<br></br><br>Trigger Warning: Please be aware that the texts you will review may contain references to traumatic events, which could be distressing. If you feel uncomfortable at any point, you are free to take a break or discontinue your participation in the study.</br>"]}
