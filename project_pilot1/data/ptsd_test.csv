negativeonhand,2018/01/07,"PTSD resulting from car accident. Was wondering if anyone had any advice for this. I got into a really bad accident about 9 years ago, and after nearly causing another accident a few days later after swerving when I saw an oncoming car I gave up driving. For about 2 years I could hardly get into a car without panicing. However, 9 years later, I have no problem getting into a car however I cannot fathom driving. Bad drivers still give me scares, but thats normal I'm sure. Most of my anxiety now comes from lack of self-confidence in driving, and imagining things like people running stop signs (someone ran a stop sign and hit me going 50 over the speed limit) at intersections. The inability to drive has deeply impacted my life and I would really like to get over the overwhelming anxiety that has limited me, so any advice or suggestions are welcome. For what its worth, anxiety has impacted me greatly in other aspects of life but this specific problem is rooted in a tramautic event."
kaitmeister,2018/01/11,"My therapist doesn't believe in diagnoses, and I feel like it's keeping me from getting treatments and accommodations. Heads up - most likely triggering. 

Hi Reddit! Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.

I've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs. The problem is that my current primary therapist (seeing her for a year) doesn't believe in diagnoses. She believes I'm able to get past everything that has happened so I can function like a ""normal"" person. She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. 

Am I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? 

TL;DR:
Severe C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled. Am I overreacting or do I need to find a new therapist?"
iwaitedlongago,2018/01/22,"How to manage embarrassment over hyper vigilance ? I have a harder time going out in public these days bc I’m afraid people will notice how jumpy and nervous I am. My pupils are often dilated, and I just generally seem anxious and have jumpy movements. If anything is loud or sudden, I will overreact and it creates rather unpleasant feelings in my body.

I may try a new medication. Antidepressants were ok but kind of turned into an unfeeling zombie, which wasn’t good either.

It’s hard to describe, but the vigilance goes beyond traditional anxiety and it can be embarrassing. I don’t like it if it affects the mood of others around me, or even makes people want to stay away.

Has anyone had luck with medication that soothes you enough, without making you groggy or disconnected?

hopeless_anon,2019/02/22,"I didn’t even realize how fucked up it was until now Fuck I wish I could just delete the whole thing from my brain. I knew the psych facility was bad with health code violations, questionable safety, fucked up ethics and all that abusive neglectful shit. 


But I knew that some things were wrong like rotten food, basic rights like phone calls, visitors, and showers being a privilege to be taken away at will.  Or even being denied a doctor or medical tests when my pre existing conditions were acting up. Some things I didn’t notice the extent until later like I didn’t realize how badly I’d been gaslighted and manipulated until the brink of insanity. 


But I didn’t even realize how fucked certain “minor” things were. Like being forced to wake up at 6 am when I got a cold or how I wasn’t allowed to even sleep during “reflection time” which was basically a 3 hour time out style punishment for breaking rules or trash talking the facility, or refusing to eat the expired food. They would take away all my things like books or drawing stuff- anything to occupy the time and I wasn’t allowed to sleep either. They would stand there and poke me telling me “no sleeping” every time I tried to sleep to pass the time.


I was at my weakest when I went there- because I was depressed with a bunch of mental illness but now I still feel so broken. I am angry and sad and I was talking to my grandma yesterday and she was appalled at the things I just thought were minorly shitty. I guess it puts it into perspective.



But my dad still thinks that I’m exaggerating and over reacting because the facility flat out denies most of the stuff, making me seem insane.

I’m frustrated and sad and trying to move on so here’s this rambling post"
myzz7,2018/01/05,"being upset about getting therapy / help i had therapy sessions years ago surrounding my childhood sexual abuse and other childhood traumas but i felt like there wasn't much progress. all it did was bring up the worst feelings i had in my life and let me suffer through that emotion again without any way of seeing there was path to healing. i didn't want to be put on medication either. on the 10th or 11th session, i walked out on my therapist and never came back. 


i still deal with PTSD like symptoms such as strong twitching when thinking about my past or very sad subjects. im especially sensitive to things like that. if im at work im distant from others and if left with time to wander in my thoughts, i will think about dark stuff and flinch very noticeably - and others might ask why i do that. it's embarrassing but at other times i feel completely okay, even happy, can function for days no problem. i even have the habit a bit contradictory to the sad thought flinch - just thinking of little jokes and i'll laugh out loud - and of course that's embarrassing to as i seem like a crazy person to my co-workers. i guess i have a strong pendulum of emotion and react strongly to it. other times its long bouts of apathy. 


so im thinking about getting therapy / help again. but even looking around on websites and thinking about getting that help upsets me. i flinch pretty hard but not even on certain hard memories, just vague memories of the multiple occasions when i had a bad time in my past. i think PTSD, if i really do have it, probably blurred my memory on certain bad things. i also can't find any good info on this stuff. i don't know if i should get therapy or not either - money is a problem for me and therapy brings out the worst emotions. i don't want to feel those bad emotions, its very painful.
