mechawhale,2018/12/19,It came back. I thought it was gone. No more. No more. I cant I need someone to talk to. I cant be going out in the streets no more I'm an adult. I cant. Why is it following me? Help
WaitaminuteD,2018/01/17,"Triggered There is a place. Where ""why"" is a question. And ""why"" is not a question. 

And certainly it wants an answer - but the answers can't be given. It's screamed out in a whisper with hands clinched, teeth shown and the jaw locked tight. 

Anger runs with blood through the veins. But all this self medicating can't dissolve it. Neither will self inflicting pain quiet it. Virtue is removed, stripped. 

This is the calm within the storm.

AmThyGhostFox,2019/04/29,Help? I think I might have PTSD and don't know what to do about it. I know I can't ask for medical advice but is it allowed for me to ask for respectful and trustworthy websites to help me educate myself so I can figure out if its just my anxiety disorder or if I should seek a doctors help?
emro95,2018/01/14,"Possible trauma from hospitalization, and people think I need to get over it. I was 21 at the time, now I'm 22. In May of 2017, I got really sick out of no where. In a matter of 3 days, I went from feeling slightly out of it, to intense thunderclap headaches, pale, body aches, delirium, and ultimately passing out. I didn't want to make a scene or go to the hospital because I was just starting a new full time job, but I had a feeling that I was going to die. I can't really explain that very well, but I just knew deep down that someone was very wrong. 

At 4AM I took an uber to the hospital and when I got there, upon checking my vitals (very low blood pressure and 160 resting heart rate) the nurses helped me onto a wheelchair and wheeled me into a bed in the intensive care unit. At this point, my memory is very groggy but I remember multiple people helping me take my clothes off to change me into a gown, and then doing an ECG on me. They got an IV into me and gave me a valium injection, as well as nausea medicine. I thought that was odd because I didn't feel nauseous at the time. 

The doctor came in and asked me what was wrong. I just cried and said my head hurt so bad, and he said ""what, you think you have a brain aneurysm?"" I said I didn't know what was wrong. 

After they took my blood, a few hours they sent me home because the brain CT came out relatively normal. I still felt extremely sick with a feeling of overall dread. I'm going to die. It wasn't anxiety, it was just something I subconsciously knew. 

They discharge me at 3AM and got me an ambulance to take me home. They ruled it as a ""nasty fever"" and told me to rest for a few days.

At 6AM, I woke up to multiple voicemails from the ER doctor telling me that my blood culture came back positive and that I immediately need to go back to the emergency room, or any hospital near by that I can get to. That was the closest one so I took an uber back. An ambulance would cost too much money and I was having issues with my health insurance at the time. 

Positive blood cultures mean that there's bacteria in your blood. I was diagnosed with bacteremia and severe sepsis. I stayed at the hospital for 2 weeks while I received antibiotics and more image screening.

Being septic eventually gave me a condition called pancytopenia, which is a lack in all blood cells (red, white, and platelets) and the antibiotics I was on (clindamycin) wiped out all the good bugs I had in my stomach so I caught C.diff, which dehydrated me and I had to stay in the hospital longer. 

I returned to work less than 2 weeks later, 15lbs lost and generally very weak. They understood that I was very sick and didn't push me too hard my fist few weeks back (I have a very physical job). 

Now I'm healthier, but I still have a constant fear of getting sick again. I try to explain this to my mom and friends, but they think I'm just being dramatic and a hypochondriac. I don't feel safe anywhere but the hospital. I'm constantly scared. I don't have a fear of death, but knowing that I could easily become diseased and suffer, and leave all that I love behind makes me sad. It makes me sad that people don't understand what I went through. They are not educated on sepsis and think well ""hey, she didn't have cancer"" (my coworker actually said that, and later attributed my sepsis to being a vegetarian). I really don't talk about it a lot, but when I do, I get eye rolls. It's like people think I enjoyed taking a month off work. 

I constantly suffer from panic attacks now, where I feel dizzy and can't breathe well, but there's not much I can do about that. Ativan doesn't help. My body and mind have been through hell and no one understands, or gives a shit. 

Thank you for reading, I just had to get this off my chest. "
Sanakesus,2018/01/16,"I hate February I hate that month because it is the month when I first got assaulted. Every time that month comes I experience the most stress, paranoia, flashbacks, nightmares, insomnia, panic attacks, etc. (I mean, I experience these symptoms every month but February when these symptoms become the most prevalent and intense). I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. I don't have a support system in real life. "
wihldflower,2018/01/06,"Hands On Again 3 or 4 months ago my boyfriend put his hands on me.  6 months pregnant and this guy had my face to the ground with his hand around neck leaving pretty red marks on dark skin.  As soon as he let me go I scoured away like a hurt puppy and started having a panic attack.  At least I think that’s what it was.  I found it hard to breath.  Each breathe was hard to catch and felt like my first after deep sea diving.  I was shaking, scared to believe this guy just hurt me.

Today that ‘panic’ feeling came back.  What started as a back and forth argument turned into him ‘playing around’ with me.  Him behind me, covered my mouth and nose and just pulled my face back and my neck was straining.  I panicked because I’m 35 weeks now and the baby started tightening in my belly.  I couldn’t really breath.  I tried pulling his hands back away from my mouth to tell him to stop but his weight pushed me down into the couch making things harder.  By the time I got him to let go he started to pat my back as I gasped for air like the first night.  He asked me if I was ok..  I was shaking and I just repeated the same words as I did before, “please just get away from me”.  

I think that was a ptsd moment - I don’t know.  But since then I can’t even stand to be in the same room as him.  He says he was playing around but I know that wasn’t a game.  I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today.  That was the scariest part.  It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion. 

I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know.  But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change."
kastelikast,2018/01/10,"Could this be considered traumatic? NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.

 I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.

My father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to ""discuss"" it. ""Discussion"" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining ""how things are""- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to ""misunderstand"", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a ""discussion"". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.

This was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing ""privilegies"" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and ""llike you mean it"". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.

Sometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.

I was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.

Limited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.

My friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.

I realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.

Thank you in advance &lt;3"

Cook_croghan,2018/01/16,"PTSD court treatment update #2: The Euphoria is wearing off and reality is setting in. It’s not all bad, but it’s not all good. It’s a punch in the gut.  4 days after my last post a marine I was in the same squad with killed himself.  That makes the average about 2 a year from my company (150 guys I was closest with in the marine corps.  4th from my platoon of 30) since 2010.  

I hid it from the court, because it’s not their business.  I went to where I needed to. Just listened to music in groups.  Went through the motions with the random doctors for medical visits.

After a 10 days I reverted, hard.  How dare I not have visited him?  Why did I lose contact?  I could have let him know he wasn’t alone. I could have saved him, like I want someone to save me.

In my head it was clear.  Its like every other person who got killed when I was point. I thought I making the right decisions but I was wrong.  I made the decisions that killed or hurt many of my best friends as a point-man.  What route we took, how we set up, how long to wait before picking up, how far we could walk before dehydration.  I fucking killed someone again.

10 days ago, (14 days after his suicide) I was at deep in the pit. Dark room, sleep, hate myself for being awake, people looking down into it telling me to “just climb out”.  That fucking pit...

Told the therapist a little of this, she handled it well.  Let me kind of hide it, but later suggested writing groups and sent texts of articles or books I’d like to read through the next few days. One day she even broke VA protocol and did a Skype session.  Very appropriate and sensitive response. 

Thankfully, I just kept doing the court ordered things to stay out of jail.  It forced me to get up, to get dressed, to function, abide poorly .  Go to therapy.  Take my meds.  Nod a lot.  But not isolating completely.

Honestly, I didn’t want to deal with these people around me who didn’t know...combat? I guess?  I was up however, so I started texting my old war buddies, cuz I didn’t want them to feel like me.  It’s one of the biggest things I’ve noticed about PTSD.  The guilt.  The sickness when you’re alone, reworking things, how you could have stopped EVERYTHING.  It crushes me.

To avoid jail, I just had to keep getting up though.  I had to keep going through the motions.  It’s the first time, in a long time, I kept going through the motions.  I kept working without knowing it.

What used to be a 6 month to a year spiral was caped at 5 days.  The past week I’ve been catching myself shaving, because I wanted to.  Cooking myself a meal, because I wanted to.  Laundry, because I wanted to.  I haven’t done that since 06’. 

Am I irritable? Am I stressed? It sleep rough? Am I fucking sad? Yes.  That’s still there right now.  But I’m up.  

I’m doing choirs.  I’m making my meetings.  Im not isolating nearly as much.  I am  slowly feeling I can make it through this moment, rather than this moment being everything.  The pit is less shallow than it’s been since I can remember.

I’ve read over what I’ve written for about 20 min.    

I guess the difference from before I started the VA court program and now is this:

I still disassociate, I still break, I still feel crushed, I’ll never be “Ok”

BUT

The pit is less deep and it’s easier to climb out.

dyingly,2019/04/10,"feeling lost and confused after reporting abuse to police i have recently reported some sexual abuse i suffered as a child / young teen to the police and there's an ongoing investigation. the police have taken my phone for evidence and they've had it for over a month. at the moment i just feel so lost. they're not great at keeping in touch and there's not many updates. i feel alone and lost and confused. i don't know what's happening and i am so stressed about it all. 

**does anyone generally know how long a police investiagtion into abuse (UK) takes? and how to cope with it all? and what happens in the end? how long will he get? was it worth it?**

RhodaStorm,2018/01/05,"I set myself back by thinking I could ask for help. And back to square 1 now... I was diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, Depression etc, etc after I came out of a coma from a failed suicide attempt in 2014. Many things/instances led me down the path I am currently on... childhood abuse (physical, sexual, mental) onto a lifetime of abuses (again physical, sexual, mental) and other tragedies mixed in like the death of my daughter...

Well, onto my current issue.. I had deactivated Facebook when I got out of the hospital. Besides that my memory was mush, people on that account had known what was occurring, contributed to or even blamed me for ""letting myself be tortured "". So it was wise to end communication....

I recently went back onto that account to ask for help. I had created a gofundme account as living on disability sucks, and I needed a little help to start earning my own money again. (I have a separate Facebook I just opened 7mo ago for family only and have been fine with that).

So with getting back on this old account, I was reading comments like ""if there is anything I can do to help"", so I thought I would give it a try... while trying to ignore the post from the woman who had an affair with my husband calling me a ""dear friend"" while I was in a coma and could not lose my ever loving mind on her.

You can guess where this is going... I am back to being ANGRY, HURT, BETRAYED , and a very unhealthy dose of self hatred /loathing constantly. These are people who knew what was going on, the pain I was in and still in and are seriously responding with things like ""glad things are going good for you"".

I am accustomed to not being heard when I speak, cry or beg for mercy... why was I such a fool to tell these people I am still suffering? Why did I try for help? Why did I think they cared? Is my brain so muddled that I convinced myself I mattered to these people? 

And last but not least... why do people honestly wonder why I don't leave the house or interact with people IRL?

TLDR.. I was a fool and thought revisiting an old Facebook looking for help, only to be reminded why I had tried to end my life."

krisuhh,2018/01/22,"Sacrificed my life to save a loved one I’ve been diagnosed to have PTSD for almost a year now. Couple of years ago I broke up with my ex girl (no here’s number jokes included) and she started acting suicidal and self-harmfull. So I decided thats it’s my duty to help her through the hard times. I don’t want to go too much on details but after months of daily suicide threats and runs to her house to see if she had already swallowed the pills, I started to fall apart.  After that, It still took me around a month of panic attacks and puking in the schools’ bathroom to tell her that I couldn’t take it anymore. The worst part of the story is that now she’s fine and I’m struggling with PTSD, panic disorder and depression. I’ve been secretly ashamed of how ”easily” I got fucked up so bad. I always thought PTSD as a veterans and sexual-assault victims problem. Would be nice to hear if someone has PTSD because of similar abuse. I really hope that all of you get better."

dookmiester1,2020/03/09,"I (23m) experienced my father (55m) having a seizure and hitting the floor, and now I am experiencing extreme moodswings. Can I prevent these things? (more in post) I'll try to keep this short and simple as possible. But my father had a seizure about 2 and a half weeks ago. I was not there in the same room when it happened, but I knew SOMETHING was wrong when i heard the ictal cry (Google if you are not aware of what this is, but it's pretty much a loud groan, all of the air escaping through the larynx as the seizure starts. I heard the ictal cry and turned the corner and saw my father, stiff, falling to the ground from a standing position, and watched him hit his head, as he was already half of the way down when I saw him.   


It was only me, my sister, and father home at the time. I of course helped him in the moment during the seizure, keeping him on his side, calling 911, etc. He is doing alright now (this was his first tonic seizure, not a diagnosed epileptic as of yet) But, weeks after, i cannot stop thinking about this, especially late at night.   


i get up and our of my room every time i hear ANYTHING loud from in the house, since it is typically only me and my father home, while my mother works. I am CONSTANTLY checking up on him, worried that i will walk into another seizure in the moment. I have a grave feeling in my stomach every time i leave my room to check on him.   


Also, a days ago, I woke up and strictly remember having a dream about the seizure experience, like a replay of that day. And that day, i have never been so sad/angry (i think i suppressed my sadness and ended up getting very irate) which is super abnormal for me. Punching my desk getting mad at games when I never do. Getting mad at friends for saying silly things (I attacked my friend for buying another iphone and supporting apple)   


I don't have a license, and I have to get one now, since my father cannot drive for 6 months. This is giving me a ton of anxiety, especially since I am being forced in a way.   


I'm sorry if this is such a dumb question, but is this ptsd of some sort? I somewhat have talked to me mother about this, and she realizes that it has affected me badly, but i dont know if she knows how bad. I haven't been working, and she has been giving me a bud here and there (marijuana) to help me sleep.   


i am sorry if I am very all over the place.  But is this just, general sadness and time will heal things. Or is this something that I need to talk to someone about, and perhaps find a way to seek help. (money is tight)"
ThisTimeBetter,2019/05/12,"Can body positions be a trigger? eg Sleeping on the right side instead of left Lately as I have been writing down when I feel triggered or anxious, I have been noticing that some of my anxiety/panic is triggered in very specific situations.

Like lying in bed on my right side of my body causes an anxiety reaction whilst my left side is fine.

Another one I have noticed is the position of my feet if I sit down sometimes make me uncomfortable.

So odd."
yoyoyofoso,2019/09/17,Tell me your story. I want to hear from you. What is your story. How does living with PTSD affect you in your daily life? What are some things you really struggle with? What have you fou d to be helpful. What kind of support do you require from others?

I have been in a couple of relationships but I have had no feelings for them. I have finally met someone who seems pretty amazing, and I have started to open up to him. But it's so hard for me to have feelings. It hurts me so bad to know that someone that fucked me over almost 3 years ago still has this power over me, that I'm unable to let it go and just love someone else."
poligirl17,2018/01/02,"Seriously struggling I have severe C PTSD due to unrelenting traumas throughout my life.

I have a bunch of debt, no sense of self, university dropout and no idea what I want in life. 

The only thing I want to do is travel but I don't make enough. I want to backpack Europe but even for that I'd need a good few thousand. 

Today, I got fired from my job. I wasn't the best employee but I spoke french and English which most others couldn't and I we had occasional french customers, I was early, I was fast on the cash register, I followed the dress code and didn't stand around talking for 40 mins where most others barely did that... managers included.. 

There were 4 managers and I had no problem with the first 3. The 4th one was a narc that totally triangulated the other 3 against me and I noticed a shift in their attitudes towards me after she decided to have a vendetta against me. She would constantly minimize me, be passive aggressive, push only my breaks back but no one else's and nit pick me to a T. Other employees agreed that they saw this happening. 

Today I woke up feeling amazing after a deep sleep meditation on YouTube- only to get fired as they told me right before my shift. This really shook me and made my PTSD worse and I've felt like crap all day today... It was the only thing that helped me build motivation, my job. It's this constant cycle of me barely surviving and then other people tearing me apart. 

Ive suffered severe attachment traumas. I have never had parents there for me, never had true friends, never had a boyfriend or a true love interest in my life. I've been used by narcissists sexually, mentally and emotionally. My mom has used my mind against me. I can't find real friends. I can't even connect to my
True self it seems. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm in this trance like fog state and I can't think right. I need to get away from the narc mom I live with but I don't make enough and now being fired I definitely don't make enough.

I guess I should look for a new more full time job but it's really hard keeping a job because I keep a) attracting narcissists who can't be pleased or b) my depression and PTSD gets perceived as bitchiness/ laziness, despite that I do try. 

I guess being on meds would help but I don't know the necessary steps to obtain them without family doctor  ( I live in Ontario Canada) 

I was on risperidone for a bit when they thought I had schizophrenia but I don't have schizophrenia and risperidone just made me twitch/feel foggy/anxiety seared through the roof that I thought I was literally about to die/ and so on and I've read awful things about risperidone anyway. 

It appears I also have super low self confidence/internalized hatred for myself there for I feel guilty when I embrace myself as if I always owe people something and I seek my confidence in external circumstances that always come crumbling down due to narcissists. "
SalmonBarn,2018/12/31,"My psychologist has confused me, I “endorse symptoms of PTSD”... help me out here I was diagnosed with severe high functioning anxiety at a young age as well as OCD and depression. My family and I took care of it through therapy and I managed to get on top of my mental illnesses for quite some time. In my adulthood, I was deteriorating so I eventually sought out a new psychologist. She has officially diagnosed me with “Major depression and Generalized anxiety” which I wasn’t surprised with. However, I’m posting here because she told me that I endorse all the symptoms of PTSD, but she and I couldn’t pick out a trauma that it could have come from, there for she couldn’t diagnose me with PTSD. 

So I’m just utterly confused because how does one “endorse” symptoms of something like this? I’ve been trying to search the web to see if any psych journals could help me out but basically I’ve only found things that tell me that this means I technically HAVE ptsd. 

Idk, if someone could share an experience of this language being used with them or what it might mean, it could be really helpful. 

It helps my anxiety to be able to understand my mental illnesses, so that’s why I saw this lady for some time now but I’m questioning if she even knows what she’s talking about, given what she’s told me recently. "
I_Am_Air,2018/01/20,"How do I deal with my passive-aggressive manipulative behavior? I always make so many decisions based on fear or because of triggers. These decisions end up being passive-aggressive and/or manipulative. I hurt friends, family members, and romantic partners. I hate this about myself. I can never see it in the moment, but after I reflect, I notice the toxic behavior.

How have you all dealt with PTSD and passive-aggressive manipulative behavior? Any book recommendations? 

Part of me wants to hide and avoid interacting with people, but I know there is more to life than hiding. I want to have healthy interactions with all people currently in my life and with the people I have not met yet.  "

dumbfuckingcoward,2018/01/03,"I feel like such a child [Rant] [NSFW] **Throwaway because I'm scared of friends knowing from username, potentially triggering rant (SH).**



**Background**: I was the victim of an armed robbery in mid-2016 at 1 AM walking less than 3 blocks from my home and was held at gunpoint.  I had been walking home from a friend's place and was with another friend at the time, we even made sure to walk on a well lit and well used street but as we were stopped at an intersection the two men approached us and had asked for directions to the metro station (the direction we were headed), I had a horrible feeling immediately and told them that we didn't know but that a stop was just up the road the other way (which is true).  After about 15 seconds of silence my friend and I started to turn around when they rushed up to us and pulled out a gun.  I'm only like 5'7"" and the taller man of the two was easily 6'2"" and he grabbed my left shoulder and held the gun to my stomach and demanded our bags and wallets.  We gave them everything (I was able to hide my phone which later let us call 911) and after handing it all over they kept the gun on me and I was sure I was about to be shot.  Luckily they took of running and once they rounded a corner we ran away too.  It was absolutely the worst thing to ever happen to me.  The police never were able to find the suspects and the robberies in my area have unfortunately gone up this past year, I also only went to therapy for about 2 weeks following the incident but I was just so sick of retelling the story and felt like nothing was helping so I stopped.

Fast forward and now I feel like such a child because I can't seem to get over it.  I literally just last night was less than 50 feet outside of my apartment smoking and suddenly felt like I was going to be ambushed and even though I knew there are guards on the property and knew nothing was going to happen I just started crying and had to run up to my apartment.  I can't even walk at night anymore without feeling anxious and I'm constantly on alert and just fucking despise myself for it.  I go to university and avoid studying on campus because I don't want to have to walk at night back to my car so I can drive less than a mile home since I will never walk home at night again.  I feel like such weakling like I'm pathetic and scared of the dark and I fucking hate myself for not just calling an uber that night.  I've literally been startled by my own shadow I'm such a coward and I can't bring myself to admit to my friends or those around me how often I'm scared by the most childish things once it gets dark out.  To make matters worse the realization that I likely have PTSD has just worsened my depression since I blame myself for letting it get this out of hand because I should've been fucking staying in therapy like my parents wanted me to but I just wanted to stop talking about it so bad that I decided I'd just completely stop talking about it like it never happened.  Obviously that's unfolded as well as it always does and I feel so dumb because I did this to myself I could've taken steps to prevent this and I just fucking couldn't because I was too weak to let therapy hurt for a bit.  

Another episode that just fucks with my to today was in October when I went to a party I lost my wallet for a short time.  I was sent into a horrible panic attack and felt so embarrassed and stupid and blamed myself for letting this all happen.  One thing led to another and the negative thought spiral just had me back thinking about the robbery and how all I do is make life harder for myself and those who care about me by doing stupid shit like walking home at night or losing my wallet and it ended in a night of cutting it was ridiculous.  And of course my friends found my wallet the very next night and it was like nothing happened and all I could think was that I deserved it because I am just this stupid burden who can't keep his shit together.

I know therapy has to be my next step but my family has a medical emergency at the moment with a cancer diagnosis and I feel like I'm going to dissappoint them by revealing how bad I've let my mental health deteriorate to the point of this just constant anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.  I feel like therapy is just going to do nothing for me unless they drug me up and then I'm just lying to myself that things are getting better everything is still going to be as bad I'm just going to be paying for someone to pretend to care about me and give me pills.

Sorry this rant has basically no fucking point but I'm just so done with myself and I hate myself for letting this happen and doing this to myself and just need to vent.

**TLDR: Got robbed at gunpoint mid-2016 and still am not over it.  Haven't felt safe at night since, constantly vigilant, can't study on campus because I don't want to walk at night, and just basically haven't felt safe since.  The past few months my depression has just crept up and gotten so bad I want to just kill myself every day for being the pathetic child I've become.  Feel like I've let my mental health deteriorate and getting help isn't going to do anything but let my family know I'm a disappointing liar who can't keep his shit together and hasn't been honest about anything I've felt since then.**

happehkitteh,2018/01/10,"Flashbacks I don't really want to go into details of my flashbacks. I have several. I don't really know much about flashbacks.
I know they can be intense.

But some of mine seem like hallucinations. Does that happen to anyone else?
I get disoriented, no idea where I'm at, can clearly see a location from my past that had bad energy."
Shenanigansandtoast,2018/01/02,"Rough night after college orientation NSFW 

I need to vent to someone who understands. 

I have C-PTSD from prolonged childhood trauma. It’s been a terrible struggle to keep my shit together and live as normal of a life as I can.  Several years ago I attempted to go to school to get my degree. 

There, I was raped and beat up at a party. This triggered a downward spiral that led to a suicide attempt that got me kicked out of school. I lost my job, my relationship and ended up homeless for a while. I was a wreck and unable to keep even a simple restaurant job. 

I’ve spent the last few years clawing my way out of this pit. I forced myself to get through a shitty retail job even if it meant vomiting and crying every day before work. It was fucking hell. I only made it due to the kindness of some wonderful people. Sheer gratitude that someone cared enough to try to help me gave me what I needed to make it. 

Today, I have a career I am proud of. I am almost entirely out of debt. I am in a healthy and stable relationship. Until tonight I felt like I was finally moving on with my life. 

Today, I took a big step and decided to go back to school and take one class. Part of enrollment involves watching a graphic video about sexual assault, harassment and domestic abuse. 

I was completely taken off guard by how upset this video made me. I started sobbing in the middle of Starbucks. It was humiliating. 

My partner was really sweet and made me feel a bit better with a mix of r/corgi videos and hugs. But I just can’t shake it. I’m shaking right now. I am having flash backs and intense hyper vigilant reactions. 

I feel like someone just kicked me off a ledge and I am so angry. I’m angry that this is the establishments response to the nightmare I went through. I am angry that I was dismissed and discarded in my time of need. I am angry that I am forced to relive it as part of the price of admission to get my life back. And most of all, I am angry at myself for being so fragile. I am scared that everything I have worked for could be gone in an instance and I could be back on the street. I don’t know what to do. "

mina11544,2018/01/15,"Is it normal to not be able to remember a traumatic story that happened to someone else ? Hi guys,

My girlfriend was sexually assaulted and has told me what happened in detail. However, I am unable to remember what happened to her from the story she has told me. I feel my mind is trying to block it out bc I don't want that visual in my head of specific details. Is this normal? I usually have a very good memory. Thanks. "
Tom4434,2018/02/01,"I'm not sure if I have ptsd or not.. I wish I could have thought of a better title for this but honest to god I can't. It's not something that's particularly weighing heavy on me, I just wanted some input. I'm a 23 year old male from Columbus, Ohio also.

Last fall/summer I was the victim of domestic abuse. My girlfriend at the time beat the shit out of me without any warning, it was my first and hopefully last time ever experiencing something of the sort and the fact that someone I loved so deeply could have did that was what really made it worse more than anything... It was only one time that this happened.

There's been a few times where I'll be laying in bed before I go to sleep and I'll see flashbacks of it and go into a panic attack. The way she breathed heavily before it happened, nearly hyperventilating. The way she marched up to me in silence and hit me square in the face... me repeatedly screaming at her to stop whilst trying to restrain her. It all would just come out right before bed but never during my day and these panic attacks maybe happened 2-3 times. This was in the first month after it happened and it hasn't really happened since... as time went on I accepted what happened. Or atleast thought I did...

Fast forward nearly 4 months. Just yesterday when I was at work, I was minding my own business doing my job when I heard a woman frantically yelling at somebody somewhere across the warehouse. It very much reminded me of the way my ex yelled at me the way she did that night when she assaulted me.. The type of loud yelling from a woman where their voice starts to grow hoarse from it while they're yelling. Idk it's hard to describe... but suddenly, I stopped what I was doing and began to shake and hyperventilate as those same flashbacks of that night I described started happening. I put my scanner down and went to the bathroom and had a panic attack on the floor.

The reason I'm not sure if it is PTSD is because it was just one instance where domestic violence occurred in my life, to me it could just be me still not being able to accept what happened. Normally you hear about the common case of combat veterans, rape victims or people who endured prolonged abuse in a relationship that develop PTSD but I feel like one instance of abuse like that shouldn't cause someone to develop it... or maybe it can. That's why I'm on the internet asking strangers about it. 

Thoughts? And thanks for reading. "

Has anyone else experienced this? "
ReasonableReading,2018/01/18,"What to do when it feels like too much? I opened the can of worms recently (a few years ago), and started dealing with my trauma. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 16.  Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. 

*My dad did drugs
*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once
*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once
*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)
*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.
*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)
*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we ""misbehaved"" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.
*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. 
*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. 
*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. 
*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.
*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.
*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. 
*I was in a ""relationship"" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).
*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. 

All of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.

I want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old. I want a chance to be 5 again. But I don't want to die.

I don't know what to do.

ArabianPrincess6,2018/01/04,"It Took So Many Years I’ve been seeing therapists and psychiatrists for the past 6 years. For 6 years each and every psychiatrist would come up with their own diagnosis of what’s wrong with me. I’ve been labeled with traits of psychosis, border personality disorder, Bipolar, Depressive bipolar, and now finally, PTSD. 
I’ve finally found a doctor that was actually willing to listen and cooperate with my therapist to find the perfect diagnoses. One single disorder and that was PTSD. 
I took it as a shock at first. I didn’t understand how I could have PTSD? I always assumed that only veterans suffered from it. I’m still learning about it. Learning my triggers and my good and bad days. 
My biggest trigger is family. I can’t deal with my family after enduring years of physical, sexual and mental abuse. 
It’s so hard to stay away from them and cut ties. I’ve moved out of my home country and relocated all the way to the United States just to get some distance. Yet they never fail to find ways to manipulating me. 
I just need advice on how to manage my anxiety, and how to manage my nightmares. I just need some sleep. "
br10na,2018/04/09,"Realistic nightmares that don’t end on waking. For the past 4 years, I have been dealing with sleep disturbances related to my PTSD. The one I had tonight has me desperate for help or advice, maybe even just a comment or two from someone who has dealt with similar issues.  

*edit: not being able to sleep has resulted in a lot of googling. Perhaps instead of a nightmare, this is a “
Hypnagogic Hallucination” 


About once a week I am woken up by a “nightmare” (calling it this for lack of a better term.) The nightmare is always brief and is set exactly in my setting (my room, the hotel I’m staying in, etc.) It’s hard to call it a night mare because it occurs as I’m waking from sleep, but in the moment it feels as though I’m waking because of the thing happening in the nightmare. 

For example, tonight I woke with a start and saw a man peeking his head into my bedroom. My door was ajar and I clearly saw a mans face, leaning over and peering into my room. I yelled out (actually yelled, I was awake at this point) “what are you doing?” Or “who are you?” I’m not sure. But I grabbed my phone, dialed 911 and jumped out of bed and turned on the light. It was as I was jumping out of bed I recognized this might be another situation where I was having a nightmare, so I didn’t call 911. But 80% of my brain was still full on functioning as if there was an intruder in my home. I literally went as far as to grab a knife and check every inch of my home. I stood in my entry way with the knife and phone in my hand for a good 10 minutes trying to reason with myself that it wasn’t real. It’s hard to describe how my brain felt so torn. One part of me was constantly aware that it wasn’t real, but there was and is this part of me that can’t shake how real it felt. 

Even now, I am in bed with every light on and I can’t sleep. Logically, nobody is here. But I am terrified and the adrenaline and fight-or-flight dump I just got has me completely freaked out. I’m convinced if I turn off the lights and relax, it will happen again or I was wrong and it was real and I’m about to get murdered. 

I have never had the effect of one of these episodes last this long. Normally they are more vague. I wake to the “knowledge” that someone is there, but I’ve never actually had a full on hallucination. 

Has anyone experienced this? Maybe I need to finally seek professional help. It’s getting out of control.

abakesacake,2019/04/20,"Dizziness - anyone else? How to help? Hi there, I’m not sure if the “advice” tag means I’ll be giving advice or asking for it, but I’m definitely looking for it. 

I have a lot of trauma. A very unstable upbringing and three separate accounts of sexual abuse, two of those instances were performed by family members when I was a child and the third when I was 18 years old. I have been working very hard in therapy (once a week for three years) and feel like I’ve finally broken really important ground on the unstable childhood aspect. I think that my body and my brain have made enough room for me to start really dealing with the sexual trauma in a big way. And it is ruining my life. 

I’ve found that my more recent symptoms with vivid flashbacks and memories that were foggy before is a VERY intense dizziness. It is completely debilitating. I cannot drive, leave the couch - anything. I feel like I’m going to be sick if I try. The dizziness has occurred before, but never like this. 

I need advice on how to bounce back. I’ve tried appealing the young parts by watching TV shows from my childhood (this usually works, but isn’t now). I’ve tried drinking water. I’ve tried grounding exercises. But I am still unable to move. Does anyone have any advice? 

Thank you so much in advance."

Occasionally ill get episodes to events that happened to me in those time periods and i can get violent. Last time locked myself in a bathroom while holding a razor and crying uncontrollably. Another time got incredibly out of it in school, got lost in the halls and when i did show up to class people thought i was on drugs. Because i was crying and looked terrified. usually incapacitated but i am also aggressive  some of the time screaming and cursing at everyone around me and some times making threats.

navii51,2018/01/09,"Need advice on finishing internship while dealing with PTSD and anxiety Though Im still hesitant in saying I have PSTD it pretty much looks like it. Yesterday I went to see my psychologist and she agreed it would be best to treat traumas I got from my previous relationship with EMDR, which we are starting next week.

Im not here to talk about my past but I need some practical advice. Im a student in the last month of my (paid)internship and I have been feeling guilty about calling in sick a lot. My supervisors are very understanding and kind, thats why I was able to keep up the work most parts of the months. 

But now Im really struggling with the last straws. I have a paper due and it is stressing me out. Usually I called in sick once every two weeks or worked from home once a week because getting out of my house in the morning gave me anxiety. I need some practical advice on what to do with this last month. Maybe I should call in sick for real, like until I feel better and finished this paper, maybe I should work half of the week or only half days, maybe I should just suck it up. Maybe I just need someone to tell me you know its okay to call in sick, you dont have to feel guilty your working on yourself and thats whats most important. I self lack this view because I mostly dont consider myself helpworhty, which is another problem on its own. 

I already contacted my mentor from school yesterday. The last time we spoke she told me I could figure it out with the internship company if I knew what would work for me. Problem is, I dont know what works for me. Each day is different. Last week I had 3 amazing days where I got a lot of work done. But the other 2 I could only throw up, cry and sleep. There is no telling in which way a day is going to go. So I feel like it would give me some rest if I gave myself time to work on this paper or going to the internship part time. That way everyone knows what to expect from me instead of just seeing if I will be able to show up everyday. 

On the other hand, over the holidays when I had some time off I felt awful. I really dont like being on my own all day and had a lot anxiety that I had to show up for work the next week. So being at home all the time didnt work out that well. 
I never called in sick for a longer than a day in the past because the pressure to show up and fear of losing my job or getting kicked out of school. But thats what is getting back to me now cause I dont have a healthy view on how to get better.




As you see Im constantly questioning myself, I just dont know what would be appropriate for someone in my situation. How do you guys handle this stuff? What do you do to get productive and how do you handle the stress of a deadline when there is so much going on in your head? Have you taken a longer time of work to deal with your mental health and how did that work out?

Thank you so much for reading this, I am very new to all this and its a bit of a thing for me to ask advice cause it means admitting I need help. Which would be okay for someone else, I just feel ashamed about the whole situation, its not a walk in the park you know..

TLDR: Gonna start PTSD (EMDR) therapy and dont know if or how I can finish my internship. Need some advice on how others deal with the aspect of jobs and expectations.


"
rightfullyconcerned,2018/01/08,"[NFSW] [Vent] [Trigger Warning] Feel like I won't recover It's difficult to believe if you look at me normally, or the way I talk about my family. I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.

I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.

I just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? 

A few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.

I feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. 

I think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future. I just want to be ok. :( "
tx-college-guy,2019/05/22,"Is it possible to had PTSD years after a traumatic event? About 7 years ago I was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor and had surgery and radiation to take care of it. While I had family and friends around me during that time, I never seeked emotional therapy and honestly to this day don't know how I feel about what I went through. I guess I'm just looking for some guidance..."
milkandcherry,2020/02/17,"Had a ptsd episode and don't know what came over me....any words of encouragement? Trigger warning for sexual assault here!

I experienced CSA growing up and have only begun to unpack it now in my 20s so it has been pretty distressful for me. I am still dealing with it pretty hard, but usually, I can get a handle on it. Today I was triggered by a movie I was watching and I ended up having a full-blown episode where I had a meltdown and felt like I had to go out to some random bar or dangerous neighborhood and willingly seek out and put myself into another ""sexual assult-y"" situation in order to cope with my overwhelming feelings. This has happened to me many times before so I knew I needed to just stay put and let the feelings pass. I did and eventually, the unbearable urge to put myself at risk went away.

But then I felt so much shame, so so so much shame. I was so shocked at my reaction it's like something came over me to try to seek out such a dangerous situation (I guess my mind is trying to make me act out the trauma again). I also figure I had to stay put in bad sexual situations as a child so my brain thinks I need to do that to survive now as an adult. I'm trying to practice self-kindness and talk about the original traumatic events in therapy, but it still is so overwhelming to go through.

I just want to know if anyone has had experiences like this and if you could give any words of encouragement as I try to simmer down from this distressing day? Thank you for reading!"
odetothegalaxy,2020/02/25,"Everything triggers flashbacks, crying every day I’m 23 years old, and last year in April my 15 year old brother hung himself in his closet. 
We were best friends, partners in crime. We told each other everything. The moment I learned of his passing was a completely life-altering moment for me and nothing has ever been the same since. 
I was in weekly therapy for 6 months after the loss. We were mostly trying to manage my grief and anxiety but my therapist would frequently grow frustrated with me because she didn’t feel like I was getting better. 
I was having extremely frequent flashbacks the first 6 months, about 75-100 flashbacks a day where I would replay the moment I learned of my brothers passing obsessively in my head. At first I didn’t realize they were flashbacks and would just tell her I could never stop thinking about that day and that they became intrusive thoughts. Eventually, a friend of mine I confused in told me what was going on sounded like PTSD, which was something she suffered from. 
I saw a psychiatrist and was immediately diagnosed with severe comorbid ptsd (I also have a panic disorder, and I’m bipolar). Upon telling my therapist she discharged me as a client THAT DAY because PTSD did not fall under her specialties. 
I’ve been too afraid to be vulnerable to another professional since, but since I have been going 4 months nearly 5 without therapy, my PTSD is starting to take over my life. 
My medication seemed to stop helping, and my flashbacks have become extremely frequent and are now being accompanied by nightmares. 
It’s gotten to the point where words, colors, songs, and phrases trigger me into a flashback and typically when I am having these flashbacks I start to panic and uncontrollably cry. I can’t handle my grief, I can’t contain my pain, and it spills over the edge. It’s absolutely horrible. 
I’m a hairdresser and I’ll have clients say certain words to me like “hang” “closet” “died/death” “brother” or make jokes about suicide even though it’s completely out of context I’ll have to excuse myself and try to get my episodes under control. It’s happened with my coworkers, and I just started a new job so they don’t even know about my brother, let alone by PTSD. 
I hear songs he liked on the radio in the grocery store and will literally be sobbing in the aisles. I can’t tell you how frequently I see someone who looks so much like him it takes my breath away and I have to go weep in the bathroom. Let alone the fact that in my mind I see him hanging every time I open my closet. 
It is becoming extremely difficult to function when I can not control these flashbacks and my reactions to them, I’m not ready to explain to the people around me what I’m going through because it is so awkward having to deal with the sympathy. 
It’s taking over my life and the anniversary is quickly approaching, I don’t know how to be by myself and that makes it hard because I live alone. I battle my own suicidal ideation which has since worsened. I still have 50-100 flashbacks a day. Sometimes more. 

I can’t take this anymore. I really need some advice on coping skills and how I can change this dreadful thought process I have. I wish my medications still worked for me because they were helping truthfully for a couple of months. I’m genuinely afraid to go back to therapy since my last one dropped me so fast, and I always felt like she didn’t like me. Advance on getting over that fear would be so appreciated because I KNOW I need some serious therapy right now and my family tells me all the time. Does anyone have any good skills in these areas? Please help me. I’m suffering and I know damn well I can’t go through the rest of my life like this. 

TLDR — My baby brother committed suicide last year, and I ended up developing PTSD from it; I have been having extreme flashbacks and my therapist stopped treating me due to my diagnosis. I really need advice on coping skills for flashbacks &amp; how to be vulnerable to another professional."
percipher12,2018/01/17,"2003 It happened in the fall of 2003. I was getting off the bus and a boy that lived in my neighborhood was walking to his house. I ran up and tackled him, as we have done many other days before. We would always wrestle, have snowball fights, goof off. Today was different. 

When he got up he grab my arms and I grabbed his back ready to wrestle. Thats when I felt something hit my in the ear hard and my leg buckled. I was then throw to the sidewalk and he laid on top of me and kept hitting me with his right fist into my left cheek. I remember trying to get up and saying ""Let me get up"" but kept getting punched in the side of my face. Then the back of my head was slammed into the concrete. I was then let up. I didn't know what to do. It was me, him and one ""friend"" just watching. He looked again, smiled, and came towards me. Again, I was thrown to the ground, hit in the side of the face multiple times, and had the back of my head slammed into the concrete. 

I walked home to find a knife, any weapon, but couldn't find anything but a brick in my front yard. I walked back to scare him to try and get him to back down. I didn't ever want to hurt anyone. I dropped the brick and again I was thrown to the ground, punched repeatedly and had my head slammed. It must have been 3,4,5 times. 

I walked home with that ""friend"" and immediately cried and broke down. This day has replayed in my head freqently ever since it happened. I turned to drugs at 14. Isolated myself. Didn't take care of myself. Then i started getting bullied. I was so scared I let it happen and never said anything. Plotted suicide. 

Its been 15 years and it has been replaying in my head ever since. I have difficultly making friends. I stay home most weekends. I feel i will never amount to anything. On the outside I look successful. I work at a great company, I go to night class to further my career, I was a successful amateur boxer, I have a great family and girlfriend. But I cannot shake this event. Sometimes I wonder if life is worth living. 

I started going to therapy consistently in 2016. I have done talk therapy, cbt, EMDR, energy healing,... I am lost. I hope I can get through this but there are times I feel I will never be confident. I still binge drink and still go through depressive spells. I wonder how my life would be if this didn't happen. It has been 15 years. 

If you have taken the time to read this I really appreciate it. I know time is very valuable and this is a rambled wall of text.  "
FargoBoudicea,2018/01/03,"EMDR has started messing up my sleep, or is it? Official diagnosis is c-ptsd. Full-blown PTSD for more than 25 years. Started EMDR about six months ago, Stellar results. Very pleased with my progress. I've gotten through three specific traumatic events in EMDR, and this last one is not going as smoothly as the first two. I cannot stay in REM sleep, I wake up with fevers or hot flashes and a racing mind. I no longer have night terrors or nightmares, so that's a plus. But I'm having intense physical stress reactions that are causing extreme fatigue, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and random suppressed immune system things like shingles. From what I've read, long-term untreated PTSD can wear your body down to the point where you experienced a lot of these illnesses. Has anyone else had worse sleep after EMDR? I was expecting it to get better. I'm wondering if it has to do with a combination of processing through one of the biggest core traumas and just the fact that my body is worn out."
myzz7,2018/01/05,"being upset about getting therapy / help i had therapy sessions years ago surrounding my childhood sexual abuse and other childhood traumas but i felt like there wasn't much progress. all it did was bring up the worst feelings i had in my life and let me suffer through that emotion again without any way of seeing there was path to healing. i didn't want to be put on medication either. on the 10th or 11th session, i walked out on my therapist and never came back. 


i still deal with PTSD like symptoms such as strong twitching when thinking about my past or very sad subjects. im especially sensitive to things like that. if im at work im distant from others and if left with time to wander in my thoughts, i will think about dark stuff and flinch very noticeably - and others might ask why i do that. it's embarrassing but at other times i feel completely okay, even happy, can function for days no problem. i even have the habit a bit contradictory to the sad thought flinch - just thinking of little jokes and i'll laugh out loud - and of course that's embarrassing to as i seem like a crazy person to my co-workers. i guess i have a strong pendulum of emotion and react strongly to it. other times its long bouts of apathy. 


so im thinking about getting therapy / help again. but even looking around on websites and thinking about getting that help upsets me. i flinch pretty hard but not even on certain hard memories, just vague memories of the multiple occasions when i had a bad time in my past. i think PTSD, if i really do have it, probably blurred my memory on certain bad things. i also can't find any good info on this stuff. i don't know if i should get therapy or not either - money is a problem for me and therapy brings out the worst emotions. i don't want to feel those bad emotions, its very painful. "
hopeless_anon,2019/02/22,"I didn’t even realize how fucked up it was until now Fuck I wish I could just delete the whole thing from my brain. I knew the psych facility was bad with health code violations, questionable safety, fucked up ethics and all that abusive neglectful shit. 


But I knew that some things were wrong like rotten food, basic rights like phone calls, visitors, and showers being a privilege to be taken away at will.  Or even being denied a doctor or medical tests when my pre existing conditions were acting up. Some things I didn’t notice the extent until later like I didn’t realize how badly I’d been gaslighted and manipulated until the brink of insanity. 


But I didn’t even realize how fucked certain “minor” things were. Like being forced to wake up at 6 am when I got a cold or how I wasn’t allowed to even sleep during “reflection time” which was basically a 3 hour time out style punishment for breaking rules or trash talking the facility, or refusing to eat the expired food. They would take away all my things like books or drawing stuff- anything to occupy the time and I wasn’t allowed to sleep either. They would stand there and poke me telling me “no sleeping” every time I tried to sleep to pass the time.


I was at my weakest when I went there- because I was depressed with a bunch of mental illness but now I still feel so broken. I am angry and sad and I was talking to my grandma yesterday and she was appalled at the things I just thought were minorly shitty. I guess it puts it into perspective.



But my dad still thinks that I’m exaggerating and over reacting because the facility flat out denies most of the stuff, making me seem insane.

I’m frustrated and sad and trying to move on so here’s this rambling post"

Rynjob,2018/01/23,"I really need advice(NSFW) Hi, ive just been looking everywhere for some sort, of assistance or advice. 

About 2 days ago on shift at the hotel i work at ( I work overnight hotel security in Canada) i got a call to unlock a bathroom door. Normal call we get, women thought her BF locked as he left for a smoke, so as i unlocked it he had hung himself. So i was taken aback took him down checked for breathing or a pulse nothing. Yell over my radio for front desk to call 911 and then began chest compressions. Did this for about 10 minutes till paramedic arrived, then went on for about 15 minutes before calling it. 

At first on that day it didnt feel real, i was kind of in a trance but after trying to sleep all i could see was that scene playing over and over. But after ignoring it at home i felt ok, so today i came into work. But just getting on the bus to come in made me feel stressed, restless, sick. I feel embarrassed and angry about my feeling and i just dont understand myself atm.

So really looking for some advice.

Ps. Sorry for the long winded post just needed to vent."
ka1913,2018/01/16,"Finally getting help I had some childhood trauma.  And being young I thought it made me strong so I thought the best thing to do was subject myself to almost 2 decades of running emergency calls on an ambulance.   I saw plenty of traumatic events that didn't occur to me directly but some damage was done nonetheless.   

I injured my back and of course doctor prescribed Percocet turned into street corner heroin in no time.  All of it doing nothing but making me not care about the pain (physical and emotional).  I also had self medicated throughout my EMS career when I was off duty after particularly stressful weeks at work I would occasionally use marijuana to help fight the demons and let me sleep.  

Well the herion use started increasing  as no it is wont to do. And then my 10 year old son stop breathing last April.  And the herion use skyrocketted.  I've been haunted by many things but nothing... And I mean nothing has haunted me like having to preform rescue breathing to my son.  

Luckily he is still here and much better.  About 6 months that after he stopped breathing I decided I need to quit herion before I stopped breathing. 

I looked for out patient Suboxone programs the soonest I could be seen was 8 days away.  I knew I wouldn't make it without using so I signed into a 6 day detox 2 days later. (There was some problems getting accepted at detox but I got in) 

 When I got out my suboxone appt was the next day.  I went to see the doctor.  He was very brash and his demeanor was not encouraging.  He told me he treated every patient the same with the same dose.   He told he would probably fail me out if I was positive for thc or opiates.  He was setting me up for failure and very unsupportive.  

I went home had a friend recommend a different doctor and the changes were to the extreme.  The new doctor helped adjust my Suboxone done to make sure I was comfortable.  A psychologist not just a therapist provided my therapy.  They made a customized care plan. Not just a ""cookie cutter"" plan.

They explained constant failed urinalysis for opiates would get me kicked out (as it should) but if I had a lapse and was honest they would help work on what caused the lapse and help me avoid another. 

After going for a few weeks I was nervous because I still occasionally smoked marijuana. Mainly for nightmares and anxiety.  I decided I had to tell my doctor's.   So I did.  And they shocked me by stating they were ok with it and felt I was using it to treat my PTSD AND they said they'd give me the paperwork to get my medical card (my state is medicinal legal only).  

They truly have a great model to really help their patients.  Their long term goal is to get every patient off of all medications or on as few as possible.  

They also prefer to treat PTSD with marijuana than any benzos or anti depressants.    

With their help I have been clean 3.5 months.

It is truly amazing to see in a state that still has some puritanical views.  I am so happy to see the progress. 

So today I had the money together and contacted a doctor.  It turns out he's as compassionate, passionate, and caring as the Suboxone doctors are.

For the first time in a long time I feel like I am making progress with my demons.   For the first time in as long as I can remember I can envision a future.... And it gets brighter every day!!!

The_Piggy_Plane,2019/05/16,"PTSD from severe child abuse. I'm M16, and I can't function properly after a series of traumatic events regarding my dad, such as him beating me with a gold club and trying to run me over with his car multiple times. My grades are ruined and even though I feasibly could not complete the work due to insomnia and constant flashbacks and hallucinations, as well as many, many court dates and therapy, the county still refuses to offer any remediation for my now ruined academic record. I have dreams of becoming a lawyer for the military in the JAG corps, but I'm afraid that I'll never even reach that point especially with how I've been increasingly suicidal over the past few weeks.

josef2000,2018/01/04,Where can I find information on developmental trauma? I’ve been told by my psychiatrist that I have developmental Trauma (and many other diagnoses). I think it’s because I was abused sexually when I was 9 and never told anyone about it til I was 16. Which lead to developmental trauma. Where can I find information on this disorder? I’ve rarely heard about it 
0FowlKreature,2018/01/16,"Iv had ptsd for 10 Years, I was never told what to expect or what a flash back is. A little insight in to my more manic/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.  The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.  My mum fractured her spine and the first few days/week in the hospital she couldn’t stand with out pain.
For the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back. I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.   I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I’d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.  I felt numb and anxious I’d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn’t go in I’d feel guilty for not going in. But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn’t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.  I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone.
Because I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol. Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.  When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a/b cup back up to a d/dd. I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time

Iv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can’t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.  Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them. I don’t really talk in therapy session and the reply’s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.  My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school

There’s an emotion I feel when I’m in a state sometimes, it’s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced.  If I had to compare it, it would be to vonrability, fear, shock and a few other thing.  I get panicy and anxious and it’s like there’s a filter over my preseption of the world in those moments and I all my 5 sense except some time touch apear  the same but feel more overwhelming and like there’s a pressure coming in from all sides (in non physical sense).  And usally I cant find an explanation for what I’m experiencing and I’m left to find the darkest corna way from everything and begin the waiting game to bring myself back down feeling numb or I go quite manic and wonder with a head strong panic and confusion and this emotion that I can’t describe, searching for a cause to my alter state. This often leads braking thing or being mean to my little sister over tiny thing or screaching to be left alone then just feeling all the worst for it.

^^Is this an emotional flash back?^^

No one ever told me what ptsd really entails, if you cold give me a little insight, it would be appreciated.  x

justababykitten,2019/08/20,"Trigger warning but I'd really appreciate some advice How can I stop dreaming about my abuse? Lately I've been dreaming that my sexual abuse happens again or that I'm having sex &amp; it's like it's morphing between my boyfriend and abuser at the same time. It's happening more &amp; more frequently but I don't know how to prevent it or at least deal with it once I've woken up.

(Basic summary of abuse: ~13 years ago (so I was a child who didn't even really know what sex was) I was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member most nights for I don't remember how long. Because they're a family member, I see them a few times a year however I really don't associate the events that happened with the person he is today. I've had as much free therapy as I'm entitled to at this point.)"
kaitmeister,2018/01/11,"My therapist doesn't believe in diagnoses, and I feel like it's keeping me from getting treatments and accommodations. Heads up - most likely triggering. 

Hi Reddit! Quick background: I'm a 29yo woman with significant trauma from my borderline mom, my brother, and multiple abusive and manipulative partners. In the past two months, I was hospitalized twice, spent three weeks in residential treatment, and lost my job. This is definitely a low point, but I've never been able to work a full time job in my life - I attempt suicide every time I try. I've never had a real relationship or connect to people in a real way. I've been on too many meds to count and in therapy on and off for 15 years. My hospital/residential therapists have all agreed on my diagnosis of severe depression, recurrent, psychotic; (C)PTSD, severe, and alcohol use disorder, moderate. Basically, I'm completely falling apart.

I've had two things suggested to me: trying to get a service dog or applying for disability benefits. I feel like either one would be extremely helpful to me, especially getting a dog - Animals are my only real passion and I feel such a strong connection to dogs. The problem is that my current primary therapist (seeing her for a year) doesn't believe in diagnoses. She believes I'm able to get past everything that has happened so I can function like a ""normal"" person. She was willing to write down diagnoses of MDD and PTSD for FMLA, but nothing beyond that. 

Am I just kidding myself, and thinking that my PTSD is worse than it really is? Or are there actually therapists out there who don't believe in psychiatric diagnoses? Am I fooling myself in thinking I could actually get a service dog who could get me out of bed, make me take my meds, and help be be in public/hold a job, and help me stop being afraid of everyone in my life? 

TL;DR:
Severe C-PTSD and depression such that I can't work full time or have real relationships, but my therapist disagrees because she doesn't believe in diagnoses. I want to try for a service dog, but she won't sign off on the paperwork that says I'm significantly disabled. Am I overreacting or do I need to find a new therapist?"
Lbvixx,2020/03/07,"Suicidal once a month I have severe PTSD from sexual abuse. I can’t seem to move forward in life. I’m self-destructive &amp; I know I shouldn’t drink alcohol, but it’s the only thing that helps me escape. Most times when I drink, I end up suicidal. My family tells me to just do it already. I don’t have anyone that cares for me, other than my 12 year old son, &amp; he deserves better. I hate myself &amp; feel disgusting because of my own behavior, but I don’t know how to stop. I want to escape the pain. I don’t trust anyone &amp; have trouble even going in public. I am completely alone. Am I ever going to be loved?"
norionn,2020/03/23,"my friend is basically ignoring my ptsd and telling me to get over it *possible tw tldr: basically venting because my best friend has ptsd herself but seems to ignore mine. she frequently tells me to basically “get over it” and tries to pressure me into doing things that severely trigger me and just seems to have little respect for me in general. 

so i’ve opened up to my best friend about a lot over the years, and she always seemed pretty understanding of my trauma and everything. but in the past few months it really seems like she’s either forgotten that i went through severe trauma or just thinks it’s not that big a deal and i don’t really have ptsd. i first noticed it when we ran into my abuser and she seemed to warn me at first, but then told me to “stop being such a little bitch” when i started having a panic attack and wanted to leave the store. this just really got to me because i know she has been in almost the exact same situation and i did whatever i could to help her and get her out of there, but when it’s me i need to get over it so she can keep shopping for candy. something like this happened again when she tried to pressure me into going to a concert of someone who’s music severely triggers me and i straight out told her “i can’t do that it would severely trigger my ptsd”, but then she spent 10 minutes afterward trying to convince me to go because it’s her favorite singer and she doesn’t want to go alone. i just feel like she’s being completely selfish and expecting me to compromise my mental health so that she can have fun. i’m at the point where i just want to cut her off but i feel like i can’t do that without expressing my feelings at least once so here we are i guess. idk if i’ll tell her any of this because i’m really not looking to have a fight or talk shit out, at this point it’s pretty obvious to me that she doesn’t really respect me and repeatedly ignores one of my biggest struggles in life. i just can’t have a friend who i’m scared to hang out with because i think they’ll try and force me to stay in triggering situations and i definitely can’t have a friend who tells me to get over it after telling them everything i’ve been through."
kastelikast,2018/01/10,"Could this be considered traumatic? NSFW First of all - yes, this is a throwaway account, and yes, I'm getting professional help - but that starts in three months. I'm trying to prepare for getting help by collecting my thoughts and memories about what has happened to me, and this is one of the things. I'm not asking you to diagnose me - just maybe help me judge the severity of what happened? Just knowing that someone reads this would calm my whirring mind.

 I'm lying awake and I need to collect my thoughts. I'd really appreciate your help in judging whether this was abusive or not. I grew up with it, so I truly have no perspective.

My father needed things done his way. It applied to everything in the house - but especially how we talked. It should follow certain patterns so to better suit his (superior) way of thinking. If we disagreed on something, we had to ""discuss"" it. ""Discussion"" is a word that still makes me cringe - I'm 23 and haven't met him since I moved out at 19. Discussion went likr this; we sat down, and he held lengthy monologues, explaining ""how things are""- If we interrupted, stated a different opinion, seemed to ""misunderstand"", anything but agree and say what he wanted, he would start over. This could go on for hours. I always remember this happening; as a kid, I was very often late to come out to play, and missed other's birthday parties because he wanted to have a ""discussion"". I could see the other kids gather outside, wait for me and eventually leave because I didn't show up - the discussion wasn't finished.

This was my only reality. If I didn't do what he said, he would make increasing threats about removing ""privilegies"" (=anything I enjoyed). The purpose of this was to force me into submission. Nothing else. To end it, I had to recite long, detailed apologies and sound suitably humbled, and ""llike you mean it"". Of course there was no sincerity - he only wanted me to debase myself and beg for forgiveness. I often did. I'm deeply ashamed of it, but I was a kid, and I wanted to keep what friendships I had.

Sometimes I didn't give up. Or, sometimes my frustration rose and I started talking back. I want to remind you - I was a kid, and later a teenager. I was /not/ a problem child, and no one but he thought I was defiant in any way. But when I talked back, he continued repeating what he said, or told me to be quiet/sit down/have a discussion like an adult. This escalated, and we started shouting. I also started panicking, contributing to the shouting, because I knew what was about to happen. My pulse is quickening as I write this.

I was a kid, and he was trained in martial arts. When I shouted, he'd drag me down onto the floor, sort of get into a big spoon position behind me, pin my wrists with one hand and cover my mouth with the other. I was panicking, fight or flight mode, my mouth was covered (and I had been crying by this point, so either snot was blocking my nose, or his hand was). I couldn't breathe. I only wanted to get loose, get away, but I couldn't budge his grip. He wouldn't let go until I held still for a longer period of time. I was a kid. I was a kid who was panicking, who couldn't breathe, who felt deeply scared of a parent, and humiliated.

Limited oxygen is a good motivator to obey. Eventually, I gave up. I was a complete mess, everything hurt and I was terrified. He made me wash my face in cold water - and hen he made me apologise for causing such a scene.

My friend jokingly held her hand over my mouth the other day, and I panicked again. Similar things have happened many times. I was in bed with my ex, me as the little spoon, and he loosely grabbed my wrist - panic.

I realise as I start to cry while writing this that it wasn't nice, but I have no other reality to compare it to. I know it's not half as bad as what others were through, but I really would appreciate your thoughts on like - the severity? Or just some affirmation.

Thank you in advance &lt;3"
roxig66,2018/01/23,"Vision Boards for those of us with PTSD In 2016, I was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). At the time of diagnosis, things in my life were going great. I had decided to try Art Therapy to tap into my own creativity and learn some new techniques. At the very first meeting, the therapist asked me simple questions that started to unnerve me.

“Do you sit facing doors and windows?”
“I don’t know?”
“Look at where you are sitting.”
“Okay.”
“If that window behind you was a door, would you have sat there?”
“Absolutely not. No way. I didn’t even know there was a window there….”

Eventually, I was given my diagnosis. It was hard to breathe. I thought all my little quarks where “God-given”. Things like – I’ve never lost my car in a parking lot, no matter the circumstances – I know when an actor is wearing contacts that slightly change the color of their natural eyes – I can tell the make of most cars in the dark just by their head-lights. These are all survival tactics my brain has developed over my lifetime living with PTSD.

Why would I have this? I wasn’t in a war. I wasn’t a victim of domestic violence. This is what I associated with PTSD, at the time. My Art Therapist explained that PTSD can happen when the brain feels extremely unsafe. The situations vary with each person and their age at the time of the event.

It’s been a year since I was diagnosed and I’ve met so many people who also live with PTSD. One of them is our friend, Kim Preske. This week, she shares her vision board story of self-care and living with PTSD. The images she was drawn to manifested in a completely different and amazing way than she ever expected. Her story will inspire you to listen to your own body and trust your instincts in ways you may not realize.

hummusandpitachiphoe,2018/01/20,"I feel like no one takes my PTSD seriously Last year I found out that I had been stalked for an entire year without having a clue it was happening, a guy at my school followed me home, got my entire schedule, and watched me for a year until he finally leaked all of my information online when he found out I had a boyfriend. I went to the school with it but they did NOTHING, the fucking principle said ""well he's an honor student with a future ahead of him"". After this happened I went into a derealization episode for 8 months, every single day I would wake up and feel like nothing was real. I was having a major panic attack and I tried to tell a girl from my school I was too freaked out to go back to the school and she said I was overreacting and looked at me like I was crazy. Since time has passed I feel like I am coping better with my PTSD but it just sucks when you feel like your feelings aren't valid."
yusoobsessedwifme,2018/01/15,"Being a young mom with PTSD When I first had my daughter I was unaware I had PTSD. I had shoved my childhood abuse in a closet to never look at it again.

But after months of sleep deprivation, fixating on having to be the perfect mom and excessive paranoid thoughts of my beautiful child dying or being kidnapped I was coming undone at the seems.

My husband pushes me to go to therapy and I learned that my erratic moods, my paranoia, my insomnia... just every little thing that made my life hard was real. It wasn't just me defective, born wrong. I knew I could do something to improve my life and my daughters.

However anger is a huge problem for me and one time when my daughter was about 1.5 years old, she was being a kid. An I just lost it, I screamed at her at the top of my lungs and slammed the kitchen cupboard so hard it broke off its hinges. The second I turned around and saw my daughters scared face I broke down.

I asked myself how I could do this? What kind of mother scares her child? I held her close and I promised myself I would die before I ever let my anger scare my child again. But its not so easy, the anger comes faster than I even have time to process whats happening and it bursts out of me. When I was young I used breaking this as a way to vent it, but I can't any longer go around destroying crap, especially not in front of a 2 year old.

My solution now? Lay down on the floor. Literally as fast as I can, lay down flat on the floor, face down and take a few deep breaths. Tell myself ""you're mental illness isnt who you are"" over and over again. When my daughter stops throwing a fit, or doing whatever it is that has dried up my patience levels and sees me, I pop up and go ""peek a boo"". She then laughs and goes ""again!""

The point is... My biggest fear is my mental health causing my child to be scarred, to have a broken childhood. It feels so good to take a moment I am not emotionally in control and turn it into something she sees as so innocent. She's too young to know that mom isn't perfect. Right now she wants mommy to be her perfect hero, and God dammit I'm gonna be that for her. 

I'm still in therapy and I've taken so many huge steps towards living a better life, I haven't even started my EMDR yet but I'm hopeful. I dont know who else out there has kids, or wants them. I know I'm not the perfect parent by any means but I'm trying, for me and for her."
yarn_kitten,2018/01/17,"Struggling to cope I've had PTSD for around 10 years now. First, it was all from how traumatic everything was when I saw my dad die and then when some things happened with my ex boyfriend. I'm now married and my husband doesn't believe that PTSD is a real thing. My mother in law just thinks I'm being dramatic about all of it. Last night, I had some bad nightmares and this morning, my husband woke me up by grabbing my arm and getting in my face (new anxiety meds put me in a deep sleep). I told him to get off of me and to stop touching me multiple times and he still kept doing it. It triggered everything and just made me freak out. I ran to the bathroom to be alone but he followed me and banged on the bathroom door calling my name which made everything even more worse. When I managed to get out to take some anxiety meds, he still got in my face and would not leave me alone and eventually ended up throwing my phone at me hard and calling his mom to tell her everything. As usual, he response was that I'm being dramatic and overreacting. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the nightmares and my husband and his family not understanding what I'm going through.im tired of constantly being told I'm being dramatic.  I see a psychiatrist for meds and am waiting to see a counselor for therapy. I just feel like giving up and dying sometimes because of all of this. I've calmly talked to my husband about how I feel, but he doesn't seem to care about any of this. I'm just done. "
iliveinstress,2020/02/07,Health ptsd Any of you have that? I struggle with it from an allergic reaction to something we never found the source to and it's made my life hell. How do we cope with this? I feel like the unpredictability of our bodies makes it 20x as hard to stabilize.
Daftpuns,2018/01/08,"Trouble with anxiety and dissociation I feel like lately I’m either in a dead panic or completely fuzzy and detached from reality. I just want to feel clear and happy again but the constant battle to find a middle ground between panic and dissociation is fucking killing me. I’m currently in EMDR and remembered some memories of my trauma that I hadn’t before, not sure if they were repressed or if going over it all in my head again brought them up but I’m pretty sure that’s what’s triggering this. 

I don’t know what I’m even looking for by posting this, I guess I’m just venting. If anyone’s has similar experiences or if you have any advice I’d love to hear it "
organize_xiii,2019/05/16,"Its been hard lately **POSSIBLE TW** Over the past few days it's been harder and more exhausting than usual to go on social media. Ever since the anti-abortion laws have started all of my feeds have been filled with, admittedly mostly pro-choice posts, though the pro-life posts have been brutal. 

I had an abortion when I was 15 after I had been drugged and raped.

CrazyStupidNSmart,2018/01/10,"Involuntary shouting, growling, whining, laughing and a strong urge to scream and punch things, and restlessness at bedtime. I've had a lot of traumatic experiences in my life and I started meditation a while back and ever since then this has been happening to me. It's like ""old junk"" is coming up from the past. And it's been happening for years, I'm wondering if it will ever end. Anyone experience this?"
blehblo,2018/01/11,"Has anyone survived a terrorist attack/assassination attempt? How are you getting on today? Just wondering if you're doing okay. 

I was stuck in the Bataclan for four hours during the Paris attacks of Nov 13th 2015. I'm better today but I still have PTSD. Noises reminding me of gunshots are the worst and I think I'll struggle with this all my life.

ajasensioa,2018/01/22,"Hypersensitivity I think I have some kind of trauma in the back of my head. I can only remember snippets, specifically of running away from something in complete terror. I just can't seem to put my finger on it. 

Does anyone know how to uncover hidden trauma? "
skookumbritches,2018/01/12,"A shadow just set me off. It's 1 AM. I'm sitting here minding my own business and I see something that looks like a very large person walking past my living room window towards my front door in the dark. Two lamps are on in the living room, the front porch light is off, front porch window blind is 100% open. Side porch light is on. Streetlight is on. It takes me a full 15 minutes after getting my gun and checking all of the windows and door locks to calm down enough to even consider it's something other than a person. I'm still not confident it wasn't. Though my driveway alarm didn't go off, that's not impossible. Unlikely, but not impossible. To people that don't have PTSD it's difficult to explain the sheer panic your body goes into at a moment like this, and the time it takes to calm down and snap back into reality. I broke down in tears. I should be able to sit in my living room without freaking the f out because of a shadow. I guess I'll be shutting my blinds from now on. Good Grief. "
Elie-E,2020/02/14,"My parent stole everything of my childhood. I thought...

iwaitedlongago,2018/01/22,"How to manage embarrassment over hyper vigilance ? I have a harder time going out in public these days bc I’m afraid people will notice how jumpy and nervous I am. My pupils are often dilated, and I just generally seem anxious and have jumpy movements. If anything is loud or sudden, I will overreact and it creates rather unpleasant feelings in my body.

I may try a new medication. Antidepressants were ok but kind of turned into an unfeeling zombie, which wasn’t good either.

It’s hard to describe, but the vigilance goes beyond traditional anxiety and it can be embarrassing. I don’t like it if it affects the mood of others around me, or even makes people want to stay away.

Has anyone had luck with medication that soothes you enough, without making you groggy or disconnected?

mr_fishy,2018/01/10,"I'm back in therapy and it was probably the best decision I could have made. Hello, all. I've been reflecting on the events of 2017, what with it being the new year and all, and I just wanted to share a little of my happiness with everyone. 

I was diagnosed with PTSD a few years back because of extended trauma going back from elementary school all the way through to college. When I was diagnosed, I had actually sought out therapy for depression but due to some conversations with friends and the things I was currently studying in my Stress and Trauma class (I was a psych major) I realized that I fit almost every symptom listed for the PTSD diagnosis as well. 

I had been receiving therapy through my university's health program which allowed for a certain number of free visits every semester. But then my therapist left the university clinic and went into private practice. I continued to see her, but I couldn't afford the insurance copay and eventually stopped my visits altogether. On paper the fees were reasonable, but all my financial info was based on the fact that I was technically still considered my mom's dependent. In reality, she only paid for my insurance and I was living in poverty while trying to go to school because I was receiving pretty much no help from my family and couldn't find work. 

From then until just a few months ago, I wasn't receiving any treatment for my mental health issues. Last year was rather hellish for me. I was in a much better situation financially, I lived in a better apartment, had a job, and in a lot of other ways my life was objectively better. But emotionally, I was suffering. It hadn't been that bad for me since I had escaped the awful home life that traumatized me in the first place.

It took a lot of mental energy in a time where I didn't have much, but at my lowest point I finally researched therapy offices in my area. I got married two years ago and my partner's insurance covers most of the cost. Plus, we're fortunate enough that I can afford it without having to worry about still being able to eat afterwards, unlike when I was in college. So I called and made an appointment. 

That was back in October. I'm now going through CPT (cognitive processing therapy). It's really fucking hard, but so far it has absolutely been worth it. I'm putting a lot more time and effort into improving myself. I've been much more productive. I'm doing things I used to love again. Things that used to seem a distant dream or completely unachievable now feel like they might be things I can tackle - if not now, then *someday*. I'm more hopeful than I've probably ever been. My partner has been unbelievably supportive and has said they're really proud of me for all the work I've been doing. 

I'm not quite there, yet. It's still a struggle. But I'm making it. I feel like I can do this. And I hope that all of you reading this can claim some happiness for yourselves, too. 

Much love ~

TL;DR: I have gone untreated for over three years and just got back into therapy a few months ago. Already it's made a big difference and I feel like I'm getting my life back. "
ReasonableReading,2018/01/18,"What to do when it feels like too much? I opened the can of worms recently (a few years ago), and started dealing with my trauma. I was diagnosed with PTSD at 16.  Ummm, there's a lot of stuff here, and it feels like too much. I just need to tell someone all of it, because I've never told any single person more than just bits and pieces of it. 

*My dad did drugs
*He hit me a lot, came after me and my mom with a knife once
*He lied and said he was dying of cancer to get money from me once
*I've been estranged from him for a number of years, but his friend lives near me and sometimes tries to follow me home (I'm almost more afraid of the friend than my dad)
*My mom is not much better; she gets violent sometimes, though seldom with me. Mostly, she just throws things, slams things, screams, tells me I'm a mistake and a waste of space, etc.
*I was sexually assaulted by my pediatrician when I was a child, and I really struggle to go to the doctor at all now (I once had to be escorted out of a hospital for biting a nurse, so there's a thing)
*My babysitter from age 3-5 used to beat us, lock us in closets, and step on us when we ""misbehaved"" (sometimes, she'd get mad at us because our poo wasn't the right shape?). Her children also stole things, and when I'd try to get them back, I'd get hit/ locked in closets/ stepped on.
*My father spent a bunch of time in prison for domestic violence, but I still had to see him because my mom wasn't willing to go back to court. So, I saw him beat his girlfriend almost to death and break her hand with a door. I thought I was going to die a few times. 
*I once broke my foot and my dad was asleep/ high/ whatever, and he didn't believe in doctors. So, he wouldn't take me to the doctor, and I still can't use that foot properly. I have needed walking aids in the past (canes, crutches, a wheelchair once) but I've been in physical therapy lately and the muscle is building up a little bit again. 
*I was abused by a scout leader when I was in my teens, and the scouts went OUT OF THEIR WAY to keep it quiet, instead of helping me or doing anything about the leader in the program. So, I had to leave, and the leader did not. 
*My mother's anger is getting worse and more frequent. She will go off over nothing, and I don't know how to keep her from getting angry. I have no choice but to keep living with her, as I am unable to keep a job and minimum wage isn't enough to live on anyway.
*I lost one of my good friends a couple years ago when she was hit by a train.
*Lost my closest family member (my baby cousin) in 2017 when she fell in a river and drowned. 
*I was in a ""relationship"" for about a year with an adult man when I was 15, and I didn't realize how messed up it was (though I always got the feeling there was a significant imbalance of power... Idk, I thought it was normal).
*I may have heart disease (Idk, still testing), and that scares me because I could drop dead of a heart-attack any minute. 

All of this weighs on me a lot. Like, so much, it's hard to function. I don't know how people who go through wars or famine can even keep going. I am just so alert, all the time. I am so scared, all the time. I have daily panic attacks. I am nearly always on the verge of suicidal thoughts. I'm in counseling, on medication, and going to two groups a week. But it's not enough. Things feel like too much.

I want parents, honestly. Just someone to comfort me, for once in my life, instead of encouraging me to kill myself (my mom has done this). I want this to end. I want to forget all of it. I want to start fresh and have a new life, with a family and people who actually love me and don't try to hurt me. I'm 23, but I feel about 5 years old. I want a chance to be 5 again. But I don't want to die.

I don't know what to do.

tootoestoo,2020/03/07,"How do I stop thinking about my abusive ex? I know, I feel gross for even saying that. But there are so many times that I think about the kind things he'd do for me before hurting me. I think back to when he hugged me and gave me attention and for some reason it's so hard to get over. I can't fathom why he would hurt me after being so kind. It's rooted deeply in my head. There are days I still miss him and I feel sick about that because I shouldn't. I don't know what to do."

metcop,2018/01/04,"Bad thoughts I've been getting bad thoughts recently, thoughts that come when I get angry. I'm only angry for 10 mins at most but when I feel like this I feel as if I want to take my own life. I want to get in my car, drive as fast as I can and crash it into a wall. I feel the blood pumping through my body and my heart beating so hard in my chest but I'm so angry at everything and want to end everything. I don't think I ever would end it but the thoughts come into my head
It's not always like this though, I often go days feeling amazing and positive but something little can change a lot.

How do you manage these mood swings?"
102-3-11,2018/01/04,"Trigger warning. It's been an awful day. I don't know that I'm looking for advice, but I need to just get this out.

I'm not currently in therapy, and I know that's what a lot of the responses will be. The short answer is I'm newly insured, and I'm working on it.

I have some sexual trauma in my past, and today I had to see a doctor regarding some of the physical health problems that trauma has caused me. I wasn't prepared. I thought I could go in and just lay it out, and be on my merry way, but apparently the dreaded physical and pap exam was necessary. It was awful. Truly awful it wasn't the doctors fault. She was very compassionate and made sure she laid out the least invasive options, and told me I could tell her to stop, and warned me of what she was doing. She did everything right. But I still froze and cried through the entire thing. Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day.

Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family.

Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day. He came to bed, and asked if I was okay, but he fell asleep in the middle of me trying to describe how I'm not.  I tried to vent to the one friend that I trust with this stuff, but she was busy. I tried a listener on seven cups, and was told to just not worry about it before I could even get it all out. So im throwing this out here as a rant. If anyone has kind words, i would appreciate them, but mostly i just needed to dump it out into the universe somewhere before it swallows me whole.

Also, if anyone has any solid advice on how to successfully get through gynecological exams, that would be actually well appreciated."
tomdbanks,2018/01/01,"Hallucinations occurring frequently (NSFW) (Marked NSFW due to potentially triggering content)

Just a little backstory. I've suffered from PTSD since I was 10 years old (I'm nearly 20 now) and diagnosed with PTSD when I was 18. For years, I would have nightmares where I would relive the experience, which seems pretty common. When I got to about 14, I would go about 2 or 3 days without sleeping to avoid these nightmares because I didn't know how to cope with them. When I would go 2 or 3 days without sleeping, I would often hear laughter, incoherent whispers that weren't real or the sound of someone hitting a metal object next to my head when I was alone. It was pretty easy for me to just write it off as the result of sleep deprivation and go about my day even if I found it horrifying. In more recent years, the nightmares have become a lot more sporadic and don't occur as often. I cope with the nightmares the next day with meditation when they do happen. Because I haven't gone several days without sleeping for a few years, I've been free of these hallucinations for quite some time.

The dilemma I'm in now feels a lot more serious than when I was deprived of sleep. About a month or two ago, I had experienced one of these flashback nightmares that I've been having for almost a decade. Early the next day, I began meditating. Everything was going as planned until about 20 minutes in. At this point, I was hearing a man speaking aggressively in French (much like Jacques Brel, but the voice sounded deeper). I'm not fluent in French, so whatever I was hearing is a mystery. The next day a similar thing happened after a nightmare except this time it sounded like a low-flying airplane was in my head. It was loud enough to scare me out of meditation and make my heart race. 

The nightmares have been less frequent since then. I have, however, been experiencing more straightforward hallucinations. Every few hours or so, I'll see a humanoid figure in the corner of my eye. Like someone is behind me watching me. More recently I've also been seeing shadow-like figures running around right in front of me. The other night I was in my girlfriend's room watching a show with her when I noticed in the other corner of the room a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye. I couldn't focus on it enough to make out any features, but I did my best to make sure I really saw something. When I finally glanced over, it was gone. She knew something was up, as I seemed distracted (or maybe she sensed my terror) and asked me what was wrong. I just said I thought I saw something. 

I'm afraid to come forward about all of this to anyone in my everyday life. I'm afraid people may think there's something wrong with me. I just need someone to verify that this is normal with PTSD and not another mental illness. I'd also appreciate any anecdotes or advice. Thank you in advance. This has just been scary. I felt like I was doing well for so long. "
realsheeps,2019/03/30,"Touching weirdness (cross-posted from r/OCD)

So touching is a big part of my OCD/PTSD/own special brand of weirdness. I cannot stand and get really uncomfortable when people touch me in most capacities. However, I grew up with the habit of touching others (on the shoulder, arm, face, etc.) as a way to get my point across because I have trouble talking, especially when discussing emotional things.

I understand that it's not okay to touch people without permission and I understand that it can greatly upset some people, because it greatly upsets me. The hypocrisy in my own brain is weird. I feel badly about it because obviously if it upsets me to be touched, I should give other people the same respect and not touch them. But it's really hard to get out of the habit of touching other people.

I really want to work on this, do you guys have any advice?"

Bad drivers still give me scares, but thats normal I'm sure. Most of my anxiety now comes from lack of self-confidence in driving, and imagining things like people running stop signs (someone ran a stop sign and hit me going 50 over the speed limit) at intersections. The inability to drive has deeply impacted my life and I would really like to get over the overwhelming anxiety that has limited me, so any advice or suggestions are welcome. For what its worth, anxiety has impacted me greatly in other aspects of life but this specific problem is rooted in a tramautic event."
EditRedditGeddit,2019/05/09,"Am I the problem, or is it other people? Tw: abuse, self-gaslighting, sexual assault, manipulation (basically all types of abuse), mention of people never coming to terms with abuse

.

(Idk whether I actually am gaslighting myself but important to include that Tw regardless)

.

.

.

The situation I'm in - I'm 21, at university, and I'm honestly shocked at how shitty lots of my peers can be to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

There's bullying and have been instances of public shaming which I believe fall under the label of ""emotional abuse"". I know a couple who I think are in an abusive relationship (the woman abusing the man), and I believe certain sentiments within my community normalise female-on-male abuse. I believe that one of my past romantic relationships has been emotionally abusive, I believe that as a kid I was sometimes abused by my Dad, I believe that when I was 18 men tried to manipulate me into sex. I believe that I've abused myself. I believe that I was sexually assaulted in my first year of university..... and then again in my second year..... and then again in my third. I believe that a member of staff sexually harassed me. I believe that in my environment, abuse and inappropriate behaviour between staff and students are normalised. I believe that on my first week there, someone spiked my drink. I believe I faced harassment from other students when I held a student politics position. I believe my housemate emotionally lashed out at me and maybe thought about me in an abusive way. I believe I have a friend who's emotionally abused me (the same one that I think abuses her boyfriend), and that her best friend enabled it.

&amp;#x200B;

And this just leads me to ask myself - am I the problem???

&amp;#x200B;

I think in some ways I have been unlucky - for whatever reason, I've experienced more mistreatment than average. I think I (wittingly and unwittingly) can put myself in vulnerable situations - like with the student political position, I knew I'd feel very anxious about it and take people's criticisms to heart, but I did it anyway partly cos I felt I'd have to, and partly cos I thought I'd do a good job. And then with my friend who I think abused me, I guess I did see the red flags and (for whatever reason) chose to ignore them, because I thought I could control/handle it. Same with the abusive ex coming to think of it. So maybe it's that I don't avoid these situations enough?? (Could my trauma have desensitised me to certain warning signs?)

&amp;#x200B;

But then part of me also thinks, is it about how I'm interpreting situations?

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 17 I went through a highly traumatic series of events, and I was only able to recover by recognising and understanding abuse. I'd experienced things like gaslighting, I became aware of common misconceptions people have - I guess I had to learn about abuse / healthy relationships on a logical level, before going on to experience them, because my trauma had been so bad and completely messed up the way I viewed relationships? So I had to reform my ideas step by step using logic/principles?

&amp;#x200B;

So there's two ways of looking at this - awareness and projection.

&amp;#x200B;

It's definitely true that I see abuse where others don't. Also I don't \*always\* mean it as such a seriously bad thing - I mean obviously it's unacceptable, does have a negative impact, and needs to be stopped. But I don't think ""traumatic"" or ""super emotionally damaging"" are prerequisites (though they obviously often come with it) - I think it's just a significant violation of someone's boundaries in a way that doesn't have a reasonable explanation, accompanied by gaslighting or denial (though gaslighting doesn't need to be there when it's severe). So say with my ex - I feel like the emotional manipulation was traumatic, but the specific individual instances of sexual abuse (and the gaslighting that came with those) wasn't traumatic and didn't need to be to ""count"" as abusive?

I can think of someone or a situation as ""abusive"" without thinking it defines them as a person, they'd act like that in all contexts, or that they were consciously meaning to do harm. Whereas I think a lot of people my age use it to describe only very serious / extreme behaviour - and people who they think are ""bad"". They're reluctant to identify abuse in those they like / love / are able to empathise with.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it that they're 21, and in denial, and experiencing all the rationalisations and justifications that abused people &amp; witnesses typically do? Is it that a lot of people receive a certain level of abuse, but never \*need\* to come to terms with it, because it doesn't escalate, and it never impacts then \*that much\*? Is it that they are significantly impacted, and some of them will never come to terms with it (i.e. permanently impacted), but most people will learn and see recognising destructive behaviour (for what it is) as a process they went through in their 20s?

&amp;#x200B;

Or is it that I'm projecting? I went through a really horrible experience when I was 17. My formative examples of mistreatment are labuse, so is it hard for me to see any type of mistreatment as non-abusive? Black and white approach?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not as if I consider all my friends to be abusive - I have many friends who I don't consider to be abusive. Some of them have mistreated me, but because they've apologised or I've clearly seen it was their fault, I haven't really interpreted it as abusive? And there have been times I've been hurt or disappointed in the past in ways which I consider non-abusive (thinking about it though, instances of abuse do seem to heavily outweigh instances of non-abusive harm when I think about my life experiences).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm generally not a fan of ""everyone else is the problem"", but to me, my interpretations of each experience makes sense, and I've often thought about it a lot? Is it just that I reflect more on things??

&amp;#x200B;

Idk if I'm just sensitive? Do I feel abused by others so easily bc I'm so impacted by them?

&amp;#x200B;

I know no one here can answer these questions, but if you're able to provide insight from your own experiences, I'd really appreciate it?"

hanna1kj,2018/01/03,"How is it discussed in counseling? My counselor doesn't like to talk about labels too much. I can appreciate that considering I've had periods of wondering if I'm a hypochondriac or munchausen while spending years jumping hospital systems trying to get a diagnosis for my pain and nausea.

Part of my trauma, though, was not having a label. Being a sick, non functional adult while being told I'm normal, healthy. Burying the physical strain and mental toll to the point where the pain has manifested itself in a physical form (fibromyalgia pain).

So I'm out here again, searching for what is the norm, what I should expect. How do you and your counselor address how your life is influenced on a daily basis by this? 

Am I just not ready? 

I guess I just feel like things aren't being addressed and I don't know how to change the track, yet again."
1029384756throeaway,2018/01/11,"Experience reporting sexual abuse? Is it worth it?

snickertywicket,2018/03/07,"Please help me understand Hi everyone,

I’m having some difficulty understanding what’s going on in my head at the moment. I think I may have PTSD, at least, I appear to meet the DSM 5 criteria for it. The thing is that even the thought of PTSD had never popped into my head before a couple nights ago.

I was watching a cop drama where the main character had to go to a therapist for an evaluation. All of a sudden, BAM, that sounds a lot like me.

So here’s my story.

Last year, my mother and I were on a trip abroad when suddenly she collapsed. I got the hotel to call an ambulance and was then kicked out of the room while they worked on her (there are other details about this that I can’t and even if I could I probably wouldn’t share). Unfortunately, she had gone into cardiac arrest and they couldn’t save her. I had to relay all this whilst it was happening to my dad and my brother who were back in our home country. 

They were able to come out the next day luckily but I was alone all night.

Ever since then I’ve thought that I was just grieving normally for my mother. I do go to a therapist about it once a week. Whenever I talk to people about what happened they always say “it must have been so traumatic” but I myself have never used that word to describe it, not even in my own thoughts.

Now though, I can’t stop thinking that this may actually be affecting me. Actually, I knew how badly I was being affected but I just thought that it was part of the grieving process. I called a friend tonight and told her what I was thinking and she told me that she’s suspected it for months! She didn’t know how to tell me what she thought. I’m not mad or upset at her or anything but I am a bit shocked that someone could come to that conclusion so long before I even thought about it! 

I’m not self diagnosing but I would like to know for certain if it is PTSD or not. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and am planning to ask her.

Did any of you have this BAM realisation? How did you go about things afterwards?

Thank you for reading"

DystopianAlice,2018/01/09,"Not sure if I still need meds? At the height of my ptsd I was on a bunch of stuff.  As things got better with therapy I slowly started weaning off the meds I was sure I didn't need for sleep or whatever until I got down to just Prozac.  

I tried to come off my Prozac last year and had a ton of rebound symptoms that persisted after several months so I went back on it.  Now I'm off again and don't have anything that's in my face saying I need to get back on it but I'm just not sure.  The main changes I've noticed in the past month have been: 

1. I wake up several more times a night/have more trouble falling asleep but it's not so bad as to interfere with my life during the day right now.

2. I'm emotionally much more numbed out, not really ever happy or sad or angry.  I just feel nothing a lot more of the time.

3. Difficulty focusing/staying motivated.  

I also MIGHT have slightly more intrusive thoughts/flashbacks than I was but I'm not sure. 


Does anyone have similar experience withdrawing from antidepressants? Is it worth getting back on meds at this point or am I probably still in withdrawls?

rightfullyconcerned,2018/01/08,"[NFSW] [Vent] [Trigger Warning] Feel like I won't recover It's difficult to believe if you look at me normally, or the way I talk about my family. I love them a lot. I also attend a good university and am fairly successful there and in my work. However, when I was a child, according to my psychologist and I guess to myself, too, I was physically abused a lot. I remember being choked by one of my parents because she was angry with me. I remember getting bit. I remember being threatened to be thrown out of the house naked and my clothes being ripped off of me. I remember getting beaten up in front of one of our family friends. I remember getting cut by someone's ring, hit with hangers (I guess it could've been worse) etc.

I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8 years old. We would have a bunch of sleeping pills (homeopathic nonsense) and I would take a bunch of those. I think it continued until I was 11 or 12, when I got strong enough to fight back. When I was 10 years old, I started having daydreams, fantasies about someone, typically female, abusing me. The logical end was that it was that they would feel bad and it would stop, but I like to linger at the part where I get hurt. I turn it over and over in my mind, I modify it a bit. It gives me a high, I feel cold in my chest and I cry but it feels good somewhere. I get turned on, too. Maybe it was because sometimes the abuser would sit on me or immobolize me, I am scared of thinking that there might be a sexual abuse component to it somewhere, but who knows. I feel like I've blocked out or lost some memories.

I just wanted it to stop. If I fucked up in my studies, or whatever, I would get hit and screamed at. I guess that made me obsessed with success and not being a failure. I truly failed for the first time when I was 16 years old, when I failed to medal at an international competition. Although I ultimately got what I wanted, I had no energy, was extremely irritable and unhappy, and just all around sad. Apparently this was MDD + the c-PTSD? 

A few months ago, I got put on an antidepressant that made me feel so much happier/with more energy. I was more openminded etc. I had never felt that good in my life. I came home for break and I haven't really seen anyone besides my family, and I guess I've had the time to go back to those daydreams, and I re-live them. I feel like my mode is very volatile, a few days ago, I had 20 ibuprofen in my hand and was ready to take them. Just an hour ago, I started feeling sad again, and I was thinking of killing myself.

I feel like this affects my sexuality, too. I feel like my attraction to men is out of masochism, I think about how unhappy I will be, and when I think of being with them, I feel the same cold feeling in my chest. I have only had crushes on girls, my sexuality with them seems positive rather than negative. 

I think I am addicted to the cold feeling, it feels good somehow to be in pain or imagine being in pain. I want to break this cycle, I don't want to moodswing like this or want to kill myself and not be able to focus, but I don't know how. I thought that the drug would do it, but it's not enough. I'm 21 and I've never been in a relationship and I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of the future. I just want to be ok. :( "

I’ve never discussed a PTSD diagnosis with a doctor or therapist as I really didn’t think I could have it. I always assumed the trauma had to be physical or something along the lines of being in a warzone, not something such as verbal and emotional abuse. I’m curious as to how I could bring this up to a therapist or a doctor without looking like I’m making my problems more than what they are. 

When you were diagnosed, if you were, did you bring it up yourself? Or was it suggested? If you brought it up yourself, how did you do it? Were there any kinds of resources you had to back yourself up? 

I’m not saying this is the be all, end all of my mental issues, it’s just something overall that has made the most sense that encompasses all the problems I seem to face. It would be something worth exploring, I think.

TooManyHappy,2019/04/10,"Advice on family members who are triggers Incredibly brief background: I have Asperger's and experienced emotional trauma from my childhood and upbringing.

I'm in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. I have recently begun talking to my family again over email after avoiding contact for a year as I needed to distance myself from them. I have a great deal of trauma attached to my birth name which I no longer use and they put very little effort into understanding this and not using it when talking to or about me. I also have trauma associated with my upbringing and my family's behaviour to me as a child.

The conversations were over email and it felt as if they had begun to be more understanding of this. Recently my Mother came to visit me and after about an hour into her being here, I noticed I had begun to feel extremely nauseous, very anxious and uncomfortable, to the point where I really struggled to focus and maintain socialising for the rest of the day and for the rest of her visit. I had a really hard time falling asleep because these feelings did not subside and instead had gotten worse, leaving me up overthinking to the point of crying and feeling like I needed to throw up as if I had something stuck in my throat.

Even though they have not purposefully me any wrongdoing and that I still love them as family, I feel as if I would be putting myself through more than it is worth and more than I can deal with if I continued keeping in contact with them. I feel great deals of guilt when considering cutting them out of my life but I honestly don't know if there is a better option at this point other than doing this and seeing a therapist.

People say that you are meant to remove from your life things that are triggering for past trauma, but what do you do when this trigger is a person, especially a family member or members?

I am really stuck here, sometimes I feel as if I am being over sensitive and nasty about this, but other times I feel justified and this is the right thing to do for myself.  I can't tell if I am being unreasonable/unfair or not and would really appreciate a second opinion on this."
