[{"id":"0_ptsd","text":"I (23m) experienced my father (55m) having a seizure and hitting the floor, and now I am experiencing extreme moodswings.  Can I prevent these things? (more in post) I'll try to keep this short and simple as possible.  But my father had a seizure about 2 and a half weeks ago.  I was not there in the same room when it happened, but I knew SOMETHING was wrong when i heard the ictal cry (Google if you are not aware of what this is, but it's pretty much a loud groan, all of the air escaping through the larynx as the seizure starts.  I heard the ictal cry and turned the corner and saw my father, stiff, falling to the ground from a standing position, and watched him hit his head, as he was already half of the way down when I saw him.    \n\n\nIt was only me, my sister, and father home at the time.  I of course helped him in the moment during the seizure, keeping him on his side, calling 911, etc.  He is doing alright now (this was his first tonic seizure, not a diagnosed epileptic as of yet) But, weeks after, i cannot stop thinking about this, especially late at night.    \n\n\ni get up and our of my room every time i hear ANYTHING loud from in the house, since it is typically only me and my father home, while my mother works.  I am CONSTANTLY checking up on him, worried that i will walk into another seizure in the moment.  I have a grave feeling in my stomach every time i leave my room to check on him.    \n\n\nAlso, a days ago, I woke up and strictly remember having a dream about the seizure experience, like a replay of that day.  And that day, i have never been so sad\/angry (i think i suppressed my sadness and ended up getting very irate) which is super abnormal for me.  Punching my desk getting mad at games when I never do.  Getting mad at friends for saying silly things (I attacked my friend for buying another iphone and supporting apple)   \n\n\nI don't have a license, and I have to get one now, since my father cannot drive for 6 months.  This is giving me a ton of anxiety, especially since I am being forced in a way."},{"id":"1_counseling","text":"What can I do to stop grieving my mother\u2019s death?

A little insight in to my more manic\/panicky moments would be good Iv had PTSD since I was eight, following a car crash on the way to school.   The car crashed on mine and my mums side of the car.   My mum fractured her spine and the first few days\/week in the hospital she couldn\u2019t stand with out pain. \nFor the first few weeks of being back at school we walked the 2 miles in the frozen over rurel farmers fields to get there and back.  I grow more and more disinclined to attend school.    I would do anything to hide, somtimes when we stared driving to school again I\u2019d locking my self in the car when my dad and my sister got out and refuse to unlock the doors until I was promised to go home.   I felt numb and anxious I\u2019d cry my self to sleep every night and feel anxious about school the next morning and then when I didn\u2019t go in I\u2019d feel guilty for not going in.  But if I did I would wonder the buildings and playgrounds with a fake smile on my face because I didn\u2019t want anymore people coming up to me to ask if I was okey and if I was sure.   I would reassure them with lies and somethings walk home without telling anyone. \nBecause I stayed at home rather than go to school I watch my mum grow more and more inclined to stay in bed as she became increasingly dependent on tramadol.  Her addiction lasted 3 or so years.   When she recovered from her addiction she put her healthy weight back on, her bra size went from an a\/b cup back up to a d\/dd.  I know because she gave me her old bra and said it was from that time\n\nIv seen over 5 therapist (art, edmr, talky, and one I can\u2019t remember the name off) and at least that again with more specialist therapists in one of sessions.   Iv developers a kinda phobia tonwards them.  I don\u2019t really talk in therapy session and the reply\u2019s I give are the ones that mean the least interaction and communication.   My reaction to therapy was stronger that my reaction to school\n\nThere\u2019s an emotion I feel when I\u2019m in a state sometimes, it\u2019s indescribable and like nothing else I experienced."},{"id":"7_ptsd","text":"question about ptsd My ex gf always claimed that she has ptsd from a traumatic event when she was a child.

Is it worth it? (X-post from \/r\/rapecounseling) I was raped repeatedly by a family member over the course of about 4 years as a child. In my state there is no statute of limitations on reporting and after years and years of trauma counseling I finally feel the urge to report what happened and press charges.

Will I have to see him again? \n\nI\u2019m a little torn because as much as I want justice for what happened to me I definitely don\u2019t want to re-traumatize myself by reliving everything in front of strangers  just to have my rapist get off.

Same with the abusive ex coming to think of it.  So maybe it's that I don't avoid these situations enough?? (Could my trauma have desensitised me to certain warning signs?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then part of me also thinks, is it about how I'm interpreting situations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 17 I went through a highly traumatic series of events, and I was only able to recover by recognising and understanding abuse.  I'd experienced things like gaslighting, I became aware of common misconceptions people have - I guess I had to learn about abuse \/ healthy relationships on a logical level, before going on to experience them, because my trauma had been so bad and completely messed up the way I viewed relationships? So I had to reform my ideas step by step using logic\/principles?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there's two ways of looking at this - awareness and projection. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's definitely true that I see abuse where others don't.  Also I don't \\*always\\* mean it as such a seriously bad thing - I mean obviously it's unacceptable, does have a negative impact, and needs to be stopped.  But I don't think \"traumatic\" or \"super emotionally damaging\" are prerequisites (though they obviously often come with it) - I think it's just a significant violation of someone's boundaries in a way that doesn't have a reasonable explanation, accompanied by gaslighting or denial (though gaslighting doesn't need to be there when it's severe).  So say with my ex - I feel like the emotional manipulation was traumatic, but the specific individual instances of sexual abuse (and the gaslighting that came with those) wasn't traumatic and didn't need to be to \"count\" as abusive?\n\nI can think of someone or a situation as \"abusive\" without thinking it defines them as a person, they'd act like that in all contexts, or that they were consciously meaning to do harm."},{"id":"21_ptsd","text":"Trouble with anxiety and dissociation I feel like lately I\u2019m either in a dead panic or completely fuzzy and detached from reality.
